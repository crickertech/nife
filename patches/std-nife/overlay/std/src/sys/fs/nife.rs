//! `std::fs` for nife (milestone 27 phase two): `File` bound to the FS-service contract
//! (DECISIONS §27, notes/fs-server.md, `crates/fs_proto`).
//!
//! # The interesting part: there is no global namespace
//!
//! `File::open` takes a path, and this system has no filesystem root to resolve one against. Per
//! §27, open-by-path exists **only inside the FS server**, resolved relative to the one directory
//! node the client's endpoint is bound to. So the honest mapping is:
//!
//! > a std program holds a **directory capability** (the FS-service endpoint, slot 4 of the std
//! > slot convention in `pal/nife/rt.rs`), and `File::open("foo")` means *"foo, under the
//! > directory I was granted"*, not *"foo somewhere in a global filesystem"*.
//!
//! Three consequences, and they are the design, not a limitation to apologise for:
//!
//! 1. **A path that tries to leave the granted directory is refused here, before the wire.** An
//!    absolute path, or any `..`, names something this process holds no capability for, and there
//!    is no namespace in which to express it. That is [`io::ErrorKind::InvalidFilename`] with a
//!    message saying so, deliberately **not** `PermissionDenied`: nothing checked a permission,
//!    and pretending otherwise would be a Unix EPERM fiction over a capability refusal.
//! 2. **A program granted no directory capability gets `Unsupported` from everything.** Not an
//!    empty filesystem, not `NotFound`: the platform cannot do it, because no capability reaches a
//!    filesystem. The same shape `std::net` uses when the `Stack` endpoint is absent.
//! 3. **A nested path is a chain of descents, not a lookup** (milestone 122). `File::open("a/b/c")`
//!    is `OPENDIR a`, `OPENDIR b`, then `OPEN c` against `b`'s handle, each hop attenuated by the
//!    last. This used to be refused outright, which meant a program could list a subdirectory and
//!    then not open what it found there. **The grant is exactly as tight as it was**: every hop
//!    still resolves under the capability this process holds, rights only ever narrow, and there
//!    are no symlinks to escape through. What changed is only whether the program has to spell the
//!    descent itself.
//!
//! # What binds, and what stays honestly Unsupported
//!
//! Bound: [`File::open`] (`OPEN`), `read` (`READ`), `write` (`WRITE`), `seek`/`tell` (an offset
//! this side keeps, since the contract's read and write are both positional), `file_attr`/`size`
//! (`FSTAT`), close on `Drop` (`CLOSE`), plus [`stat`]/[`exists`] built from open + fstat + close.
//!
//! **Also bound since milestone 31 phase 2:** `create` and `create_new` (`CREATE`) and `truncate`
//! (`TRUNCATE`), which means **`File::create` and `std::fs::write` work now** rather than being
//! Unsupported by construction. Two things this corrects. Creating a *file* was never what §27 kept
//! host-side; that was creating a *filesystem*, which needs uuid and getrandom, and
//! `Transaction::create_node` is not std-gated, so a file can be made on-device without entropy
//! becoming a userspace dependency. And the previous refusal was the right call at the time for a
//! reason worth remembering: without `TRUNCATE`, `std::fs::write` would have left a tail of the old
//! contents behind, so a write that half-worked would have read as a write that failed, which is
//! precisely the confusion DECISIONS §27 records being corrected four times in one day.
//!
//! **Also bound since milestone 64:** `read_dir`, `create_dir`, `remove_file`, `remove_dir` and
//! `rename`, on the verbs milestones 47 and 48 added (`OPENDIR`, `READDIR`, `MKDIR`, `UNLINK`,
//! `RMDIR`, `RENAME`). Every one of them was refused here for a reason that had stopped being true:
//! this module said "no verb in the contract backs it" long after the server started dispatching
//! all six. Milestone 64's measurement found them by asking fifty crates.io crates what they
//! needed; see notes/crates-io-on-nife.md.
//!
//! **And since milestone 64's second pass:** `File::set_len` (`TRUNCATE` again, with the size in the
//! second word instead of 0) and [`copy`] (no verb, and none needed: it is an open, a read/write
//! loop and two closes).
//!
//! **And since milestone 122:** nested paths anywhere a name is taken, [`Dir`] (std's own
//! `openat`-shaped API, unstable as `#![feature(dirfd)]`), and `remove_dir_all`, which needed no
//! code at all: std's generic implementation is written in terms of `read_dir` and `remove_file`
//! on paths it composes itself, so it started working the moment those paths resolved.
//!
//! Still Unsupported, each because no verb in the contract backs it: symlinks and hard links,
//! `canonicalize`, permissions, file times, locks, and `duplicate` (a handle is a
//! token the server minted; there is no dup verb). `modified`/`accessed`/`created` are the ones to
//! watch: the server keeps an mtime and §43 gave us a clock to read it against, so the only missing
//! piece is a **wire-format change** to `FSTAT`'s reply, which is the expensive kind of decision
//! (two programs have to agree) and is not a lane's to make.
//!
//! See notes/std.md for the full list with reasons.

/// no program would ever be written to hold a directory and the system's model would be invisible
/// to everything running on it, which is a capability system quietly becoming an ambient one with
/// extra steps.
///
/// **It is not an interface this project invented**, which was the surprise: `std::fs::Dir` exists
/// upstream behind `#![feature(dirfd)]` (rust-lang/rust#120426) and is exactly `openat`. Until this
/// milestone nife got std's generic fallback, which stores a `canonicalize`d path, so `Dir::open`
/// on this system failed at the first call in the first line, and the type most aligned with what
/// this OS *is* was the one type it could not offer. It is also what `cap-std` binds to, which is
/// DECISIONS §84's first preference for porting real software.
///
/// # The rights it asks for, which is the whole design
///
/// Everywhere else in this module the rule is **ask for the minimum the verb needs**, because
/// over-asking is `EPERM` rather than attenuation and a PAL cannot read its own capability. A held
/// directory has no single verb to be the minimum of: it is an object, and what will be asked of it
/// later is not knowable when it is minted.
///
/// So a `Dir` asks for **everything its parent carries**, which is what `openat(dirfd, name,
/// O_DIRECTORY)` hands back on Unix and is the honest analogue. It cannot widen anything: the
/// server's answer is `parent & requested`, so the result is the projection of an authority this
/// process already holds onto one directory inside it.
///
/// Knowing what the parent carries is the awkward part, because **the contract has no way to say
/// "attenuate to whatever you have"** and no verb that reports a handle's rights. The common case
/// costs one message: ask for `dir::ALL`, and a full-rights grant answers with the handle. A
/// narrowed grant answers `EPERM`, and then [`Dir::held_rights`] finds out exactly what is there by
/// asking for one right at a time, six messages, once per `Dir::open` at the first hop only, since
/// every hop after that descends from a parent whose rights are now known.
///
/// That probe is a workaround and is recorded as one: the fix is a sentinel in `OPENDIR`'s rights
