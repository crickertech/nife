//! `std::net` for nife (milestone 27 phase two): `TcpStream` and outbound `UdpSocket` bound
//! to the net_stack socket contract (DECISIONS §25, notes/net.md, `user/src/netproto.rs`).
//!
//! This is the client half of the contract std sees. A std program given the network holds a
//! `Stack` endpoint at slot 2 and an untyped budget at slot 3 (the slot convention in
//! `pal/nife/rt.rs`). Opening a socket mints a shared `PageFrame` from the untyped, maps it, and
//! delegates it to net_stack (`SEND_CAP`, `OP_ATTACH_PAGE_FRAME`); every later operation is one `CALL`
//! carrying a **socket id** and control words, with the payload already sitting in the shared
//! frame. net_stack drives smoltcp over the confined NIC and replies. Bytes never cross a message.
//!
//! **Blocking, one exchange at a time.** The contract is synchronous: a `CALL` blocks in net_stack
//! while it services the network, so a std `read` blocks until data arrives, exactly the
//! semantics `std::net`'s default blocking API wants. The target is single-threaded, so a program
//! can hold several sockets (up to `MAX_SOCKETS`) but can only ever have one operation in flight.
//!
//! ## The inbound half: `TcpListener` is a held authority, not a call that happens to work
//!
//! `bind` is `OP_LISTEN` and `accept` is `OP_ACCEPT` (milestone 64, the contract's half landed in
//! milestone 107). The part worth understanding before reading the code is that **a listening port
//! is a grant this program was given, or was not**, and nothing in the program decides which:
//! `net_stack` is spawned with a **listen grant** (`netproto::listen_grant`), an inclusive port
//! range, and refuses `LISTEN` outside it. `NO_LISTEN_GRANT` is the default, so a std program on
//! a stack nobody granted ports to is refused **every** port. That is why `bind` has a
//! `PermissionDenied` arm at all, and it is the one error here that a caller cannot fix by trying
//! somewhere else: no other port helps, because the answer was about authority, not about the port.
//!
//! Three answers, three `ErrorKind`s, and the split is the contract's rather than a mapping
//! invented here (`netproto`'s `LISTEN_*` vocabulary exists for exactly this reason):
//!
//! | contract | `std::io::ErrorKind` | what a caller should do |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `LISTEN_GRANTED` | (success) | serve |
//! | `LISTEN_DENIED` | `PermissionDenied` | ask whoever spawned you for the port; do not retry |
//! | `LISTEN_IN_USE` | `AddrInUse` | pick another port |
//!
//! **A listener and a connection are two objects, and this PAL keeps them apart** because the
//! contract does (notes/net.md, "A listener is not a connection"). A listener holds a socket id and
//! **no shared frame at all**, since no bytes ever cross on it; `accept` allocates a *second* id,
//! attaches that one's frame, and asks `OP_ACCEPT` to install the connection there. `net_stack`
//! refuses an accept into the listener's own id, so the POSIX move of letting a listening descriptor
//! become the connection in place is not expressible from here.
//!
//! The listener **re-arms inside `ACCEPT`**, so `for stream in listener.incoming()` works and serves
//! connections one after another indefinitely. What it does not do is serve two at once: the target
//! is single-threaded and the contract is one exchange per `CALL`, so a second peer arriving while
//! this program is busy on an earlier connection gets a RST rather than a wait (the backlog is one
//! connection deep). See the `BUGS` list below.
//!
//! ## What is honestly Unsupported, and why
//! - **An accepted connection's peer address.** `accept` must return a `SocketAddr` and the
//!   contract's `OP_ACCEPT` reply carries no peer, so what comes back is `0.0.0.0:0` and
//!   `peer_addr()` on an accepted stream reports the same. That is a placeholder and it is named
//!   as one here rather than dressed up: a server that logs its peers logs zeros on nife.
//!   Reporting the real peer means changing what two programs agree on (a second reply word, or the
//!   frame's dead `dst` fields the way a UDP `RECV` already uses them), which is not a PAL
//!   decision. See notes/net.md.
//! - **Non-blocking mode and read/write timeouts.** The contract is blocking-only; there is no
//!   poll verb. `set_nonblocking(true)` and `set_*_timeout(Some(..))` return `Unsupported`;
//!   `set_nonblocking(false)` and the `None` timeouts (which mean "block") succeed.
//! - **DNS / `lookup_host`.** No resolver rides the contract; the demo uses literal addresses and
//!   does its own DNS as a plain UDP round trip. `lookup_host` returns `Unsupported`, so
//!   `ToSocketAddrs` resolves only already-numeric addresses.
//! - **IPv6.** net_stack is IPv4-only (smoltcp built with `proto-ipv4`). A V6 address is `Unsupported`.
//! - **`peek`, `duplicate`, multicast join/leave.** No contract verb backs them.
//!
//! Advisory knobs with no contract effect (`set_nodelay`, `set_ttl`, `set_linger`, broadcast,
//! multicast options) accept and return plausible values rather than fail, the way minimal
//! backends do; they change nothing on the wire.
