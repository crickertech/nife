//! Randomness for nife: **a granted capability, and a loud refusal when it is absent**
//! (milestone 56; DECISIONS §44, notes/entropy.md).
//!
//! This file used to open with "not cryptographic, and saying so is the point": a splitmix64 stream
//! seeded from the virtual counter, predictable to anyone who could guess boot-relative time. That
//! caveat tainted anything security-adjacent anywhere in the tree, so it was replaced rather than
//! patched, exactly as its own last paragraph said it should be. What replaced it is a **virtio-rng
//! device held by a userspace entropy service**, reached through one endpoint in slot
//! [`rt::ENTROPY_SLOT`]. This program cannot touch the device; it can only ask.
//!
//! # The fork this file settles: transparent, and split on std's own seam
//!
//! `std::random` improves **transparently**: a program that calls [`crate::random::SystemRng`] gets
//! real entropy the moment it is granted the capability, with no nife-specific API to learn and
//! no code to change. The honesty that "explicit" would have bought is preserved a different way,
//! by refusing rather than by degrading, and the two callers are split where std already splits
//! them:
//!
//! - [`fill_bytes`] backs `SystemRng`, which std documents as "random data suitable for
//!   cryptographic purposes such as key generation". That is a promise, so a program that holds no
//!   entropy capability gets a **panic** naming the reason. `fill_bytes` has no error channel (the
//!   same wall `SystemTime::now()` hit, DECISIONS §43), and the only refusal available is a loud
//!   one. Quietly substituting a counter-seeded stream here is precisely the failure this milestone
//!   exists to remove.
//! - [`hashmap_random_keys`] backs `RandomState`, whose promise is DoS resistance for a hash table
//!   and nothing more. std's own `unsupported` backend seeds it from allocation addresses rather
//!   than panicking, so the platform is allowed to be best-effort here. A program with the
//!   capability gets device bytes; a program without gets the counter-seeded splitmix64 stream
//!   below, which is what this whole file used to be. A `HashMap` in a program nobody granted
//!   entropy still works, and no key is ever minted from it.
//!
//! So the rule is one sentence: **the caller that promises cryptographic strength refuses when it
//! cannot keep the promise, and the caller that promises nothing degrades and says so.**
//!
//! # What the bytes are
//!
//! Whatever the device produced, unmodified. The service pools nothing and whitens nothing (there
//! is no cryptographic primitive in this tree to whiten with, and a reversible permutation would
//! only obscure the claim). Under QEMU the device is backed by the host's `/dev/urandom`; on real
//! silicon it is the board's TRNG, and notes/entropy.md carries what that does and does not
//! promise.
