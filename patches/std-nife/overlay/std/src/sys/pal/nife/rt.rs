//! The std runtime contract, and the syscall glue that meets it.
//!
//! This is the PAL's twin of `crates/user_rt`: the same `svc #0` / `ecall` instructions, the
//! same register convention, deliberately re-stated here because std cannot depend on an
//! out-of-tree crate. The ABI *constants* are not re-stated: `abi.rs` next door is generated
//! verbatim from `crates/abi/src/lib.rs` by `cargo xtask std-src`, so the numbers cannot drift.
//! Only these few asm wrappers are hand-copied; if `user_rt`'s change, change these.
//!
//! # The std slot convention
//!
//! A std program's loader owes it, per the out-of-band-contract rule of notes/abi.md §4:
//!
//! - **slot 0**: an untyped budget. The global allocator draws heap pages from it lazily via
//!   `memory_region::MAP`, at [`HEAP_BASE`], capped at [`HEAP_MAX`].
//! - **slot 1**: an endpoint with WRITE. `stdout` and `stderr` SEND here, 16 bytes per message
//!   (w0 = byte count, w1|w2 = the bytes, little-endian). Interleaving of out and err is the
//!   phase-one price of one endpoint; milestone 28's terminal contract owns fixing it.
//!
//! And two more, granted only to a std program that is given the network (milestone 27 phase two;
//! the net PAL in `sys/net` binds them, DECISIONS §25):
//!
//! - **slot 2**: the `Stack` endpoint with WRITE. `std::net` speaks the net_stack socket contract
//!   (`netproto`) over it: `CALL`s carry a socket id and control words, `SEND_CAP` delegates a
//!   per-socket shared frame. A program not given the network leaves this slot empty, and every
//!   `TcpStream`/`UdpSocket` operation returns `Unsupported` rather than blocking.
//! - **slot 3**: an untyped budget the net PAL mints and maps each socket's shared frame from.
//!
//! And one more, granted only to a std program that is given a **directory** (milestone 27 phase
//! two, the FS-service half; the fs PAL in `sys/fs` binds it, DECISIONS §27):
//!
//! - **slot 4**: the FS-service endpoint with WRITE. That endpoint **is** the directory
//!   capability: the server it reaches is bound to one directory node, and every name `std::fs`
//!   sends is resolved under that directory. There is no global namespace to reach past it, so a
//!   path that tries to leave the directory is refused before it ever reaches the wire. The grant
//!   comes with one page the loader maps at [`FS_PAGE`], the contract's unit of transfer. A
//!   program left this slot empty gets `Unsupported` from every `std::fs` call, which is what "no
//!   ambient filesystem" feels like from inside a process.
//!
//! And one more, granted only to a std program that is given a **wall clock** (milestone 51; the
//! time PAL in `sys/time` binds it, DECISIONS §43):
//!
//! - **slot 5**: a `PageFrame` capability naming the clock page, with `READ`. The loader maps that
//!   same page **read-only** at [`CLOCK_PAGE`], and `SystemTime::now()` is then the ambient
//!   monotonic counter plus the offset the clock service published there: two loads and an add,
//!   no server round trip, and nothing this program can write. A program left this slot empty
//!   does not know what time it is and `SystemTime::now()` says so loudly rather than reporting
//!   1970 plus uptime, which is what it used to do.
//!
//! And one more, granted only to a std program that is given **entropy** (milestone 56; the random
//! PAL in `sys/random` binds it, DECISIONS §44):
//!
//! - **slot 6**: the entropy service's request endpoint with WRITE. It means *"you may obtain
//!   randomness"*, and it names no device: the service holds the virtio-rng transport and this
//!   program cannot reach it. `std::random::SystemRng` (which promises bytes "suitable for
//!   cryptographic purposes") is a `CALL` on this endpoint, and a program left this slot empty gets
//!   a **panic** rather than a predictable stand-in, for the same reason `SystemTime::now()` does:
//!   the function has no error channel and the alternative is a lie. `HashMap`'s seed is the one
//!   caller std itself treats as best-effort, and it keeps working either way; see `sys/random`.
//!
//! And one more, granted only to a std program that is given **inert configuration** (milestone
//! 47's environment-variable fork, DECISIONS §111; `sys/env` binds it):
//!
//! - **slot 7**: a `PageFrame` capability naming the inert-configuration page, with `READ`. The
//!   loader maps that same page **read-only** at [`CONFIG_PAGE`], and `sys/env`'s `seed`
//!   populates `std::env`'s `TZ`, `LANG` and `TERM` from it once, at process startup, before
//!   `main` runs (`pal::nife::init`). A program left this slot empty is seeded with nothing,
//!   which is the same honest-absence shape every other slot here uses: `env::var("TZ")`
//!   answers `Err` because nobody granted this program a timezone, not because the lookup
//!   failed. Unlike the clock page, this one has exactly one writer and it finishes before the
//!   page has a second reader, so there is no seqlock to it (see `environment_proto`'s own docs).
//!
//! Programs that never allocate, print, open a socket, or open a file never touch the slots they
//! do not use.
