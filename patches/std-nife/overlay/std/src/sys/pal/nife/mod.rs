//! Platform Abstraction Layer for nife (milestone 27): std over the native capability ABI.
//!
//! This is the Hermit shape (a `sys` backend implemented directly on a non-POSIX ABI), not the
//! Redox shape (a libc first): there is no errno, no fd table, no `open`, no `fork` under here,
//! because the OS does not have them and std does not actually need them. What a nife
//! process *does* have is a cspace populated by its parent, and this PAL binds std to the two
//! slots the std runtime contract names (see `rt`): an untyped budget that pays for the heap,
//! and an endpoint that stdout/stderr SEND to.
//!
//! `net` and `fs` are bound to their capability-granted servers (phase two: net_stack's socket contract
//! and the FS service), and each answers `Unsupported` when the program was not granted the
//! capability that reaches its server. Everything the OS cannot honestly do yet (`process`,
//! `thread::spawn`, ...) keeps the shared dispatch fallback rather than pretending; those PALs bind
//! here when the servers behind them exist.
//!
//! This file lives in the nife repo (patches/std-nife) and is materialized into a
//! patched rust-src by `cargo xtask std-src`; see notes/std.md for how the sysroot is built.
