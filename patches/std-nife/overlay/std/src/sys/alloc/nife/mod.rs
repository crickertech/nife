//! The System allocator for nife: the untyped-backed heap, inside std.
//!
//! The algorithm is `crates/user_heap`, generated verbatim into `user_heap.rs` next door by
//! `cargo xtask std-src` (so the host-tested source is the only source). This file is the same
//! policy layer as `user_rt::heap::MemoryRegionHeap`, re-stated for std because std cannot depend on
//! the out-of-tree crate: a spinlock, lazy wiring to the untyped in slot 0, and grow-on-demand
//! by `memory_region::MAP` at the top of the committed range.
//!
//! Lazy, because std has no moment where a program says "init the heap": the first allocation
//! (often std's own rt setup) simply finds committed == 0 and grows. A program whose slot 0 is
//! not an untyped gets a failed allocation, which std turns into the OOM abort: honest, if
//! blunt. The spinlock is uncontended today (no `thread::spawn`, phase one) and stays correct
//! under preemption when threads arrive; see notes/std.md for the caveat.
