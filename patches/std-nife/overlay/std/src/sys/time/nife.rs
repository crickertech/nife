//! Time on nife: the monotonic counter for `Instant`, and a granted clock for `SystemTime`.
//!
//! # `Instant` is the counter, and nothing may perturb it
//!
//! Exactly what the hardware gives: monotonic ticks since boot, converted with the counter
//! frequency, read with one instruction and no syscall (the one ambient readable the ABI grants,
//! notes/abi.md). Nothing in this file, and nothing in the clock service, ever touches it.
//!
//! # `SystemTime` is the counter plus a granted offset (milestone 51, DECISIONS §43)
//!
//! Wall-clock time is **counter + offset**, and the offset lives in a page the clock service
//! publishes and a reader holds **read-only**. So `SystemTime::now()` is two loads and an add, with
//! no server round trip, and adjusting the wall clock cannot move `Instant` **by construction**:
//! the counter is not in the write path.
//!
//! Reading the clock is therefore an authority a program either was granted or was not:
//!
//! - **Slot [`rt::CLOCK_SLOT`]** holds a `Frame` capability naming the clock page, and the loader
//!   maps that page read-only at [`rt::CLOCK_PAGE`]. A program given both has a real wall clock.
//! - A program given neither **does not know what time it is**, and this file says so rather than
//!   guessing.
//!
//! # What replaced the lie, and why the replacement panics
//!
//! Until this milestone `SystemTime` was the monotonic counter offset from `UNIX_EPOCH`, so the
//! machine reported **January 1970 plus uptime**. That is the exact failure mode DECISIONS §42
//! forbids: not that the platform lacked a clock, but that the interface lied about it, and a
//! caller could not tell a wrong answer from a right one.
//!
//! `SystemTime::now()` has no error channel, so the only loud refusal available is a **panic**, and
//! that is what an unknown clock gets. A program that never asks the time is unaffected; a program
//! that asks gets told, with the reason, instead of quietly stamping a log with 1970. The readable
//! form of the same state lives one level down in `clock_proto::state`, for anything that wants to
//! check before asking. See notes/std.md.

//   - the clock page's Frame capability: the kernel answers `BadMethod` (-5), which is a refusal
//     from a real object and therefore proof that one is there.

// Cached, because the answer cannot change: a capability table slot's contents are fixed at spawn on this
// ABI (0 = not yet asked, 1 = granted, 2 = not granted). Same shape as the fs PAL's probe.
