//! stdout/stderr over the **sink contract** (`crates/byte_sink_proto`, milestone 50), on the endpoint
//! the std slot convention puts in slot 1 (see `pal/nife/rt.rs`): SEND, register-only, up to 16
//! bytes per message.
//!
//! Bulk data over a register-only IPC is deliberate, and since milestone 50 it is forced rather
//! than merely cheap. The three-word message is the ABI's whole fastpath (notes/abi.md §2) and
//! std's own `LineWriter` batches user writes, but the real argument is substitutability: a sink
//! that also required a page mapped at an agreed address could not be swapped for another by
//! putting a different capability in this slot, and *that* is what redirection is here. See
//! notes/sink-protocol.md.
//!
//! stdin is honest EOF: nothing grants a std program input yet. The sink contract is one-directional
//! by construction, and a source contract is its own design.
//!
//! stderr shares the endpoint, so out and err interleave by 16-byte chunk. Recorded as a caveat in
//! notes/std.md; one endpoint is what the contract grants today.
//!
//! # A dead reader ends this program, and a missing one does not
//!
//! This used to swallow every failed SEND, on the grounds that "a program without a console still
//! runs, it just prints into the void, which is what every OS does to a process whose stdout is
//! closed". That is right for a program with no console and wrong for a pipeline, where `yes | head`
//! must end when `head` exits. `byte_sink_proto::classify` splits the two, and each half is routed
//! through the seam std already has for exactly this:
//!
//! - **No sink** ([`byte_sink_proto::Sent::NoSink`]) is [`io::ErrorKind::Unsupported`], which
//!   [`is_ebadf`] accepts, so `io::stdio`'s `handle_ebadf` swallows it and the program keeps
//!   running. It is also the same answer every other ungranted capability gives in this PAL.
//! - **A destroyed sink** ([`byte_sink_proto::Sent::Gone`]) is [`io::ErrorKind::BrokenPipe`], which
//!   `is_ebadf` rejects, so it propagates and `println!` panics. The target is panic=abort, so the
//!   process dies and the kernel attributes the fault. That is what a Rust program on Linux does
//!   when its reader exits, and it is milestone 50's "`SIGPIPE` becomes a return code".
