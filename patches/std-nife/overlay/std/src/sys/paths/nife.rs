//! `std::env`'s *path* half on nife (milestone 64): the four functions that name places, and the
//! two that take a list of them apart.
//!
//! # Why this file exists, and it is the same reason `sys/env/nife.rs` exists
//!
//! nife had no `paths` backend at all, so it fell through to `sys/paths/unsupported.rs`, and two of
//! that file's functions are not refusals:
//!
//! ```text
//! pub fn temp_dir() -> PathBuf   { panic!("no filesystem on this platform") }
//! pub fn split_paths(..)         { panic!("unsupported") }
//! ```
//!
//! So **`std::env::temp_dir()` aborted the process**, and it compiled perfectly. That is exactly the
//! shape milestone 64's second pass found in `env::vars()`, one module over, and it is the shape a
//! gap list built from `Unsupported` counts cannot see: neither call ever returns an error, so
//! neither appears as a refusal anywhere.
//!
//! It is not academic. `tempfile::NamedTempFile::new()` calls `tempfile::env::temp_dir()`, which
//! delegates straight to `std::env::temp_dir`, so every `tempfile` operation on nife died here
//! **before** reaching the `other.rs` arm that returns "operation not supported". The measurement
//! note said tempfile "builds, links, and returns an error"; it built, linked, and aborted. Eleven
//! of the fifty probe closures reach `env::temp_dir` and eight reach `split_paths`.
//!
//! # What is answered, what is refused, and the line between them
//!
//! **Refused, honestly:** `chdir` and `current_exe` return [`io::ErrorKind::Unsupported`], and
//! `home_dir` is `None`. Each of those *can* say no in its own signature, and each of them needs
//! something this process has not been given.
//!
//! **`getcwd` stopped being one of them on 2026-08-18** (milestone 47's namespace half). It answers
//! `/`, and that is not a new fiction: `sys/fs/nife.rs` accepts a leading `/` as the root of *this
//! process's* namespace, which is the directory it was granted, so the path `getcwd` returns is one
//! the filesystem half resolves. A process holding no directory capability still gets
//! `Unsupported`, from the same `is_reachable()` probe every `std::fs` entry point uses: naming a
//! place you hold no capability for would be this file's own recurring failure, an answer where a
//! refusal was the truth.
//!
//! **Answered, because the signature leaves no way to refuse:** `temp_dir` returns a `PathBuf` and
//! `split_paths` returns an iterator. There is no error channel in either, so "this platform has
//! none" is not expressible and something has to be named. The rule this file follows, and it is
//! the one milestone 64 keeps rediscovering: **fix the ones that abort, leave the ones that
//! refuse.**
//!
//! # `temp_dir`, and why it was not the namespace fork in disguise
//!
//! `TMPDIR` first, exactly as `sys/paths/unix.rs` does, then `/` as the fallback.
//!
//! The variable comes first for a reason beyond parity: it is the seam milestone 47's namespace
//! arrives through. Nothing seeds a nife process's environment today (see `sys/env/nife.rs`), so
//! the lookup misses; the day a program can be *given* a variable, `TMPDIR` steers this with no
//! change to this file.
//!
//! The fallback is `/`, which is where `getcwd` says you are, and the two are the same place:
//! `sys/fs/nife.rs`'s `one_name` decided that *"./motd is motd: the current directory IS the
//! granted one"*, and the namespace half added that `/motd` is `motd` too. A process holds one
//! directory capability and that is the whole of its authority over files, so the only place a
//! temporary file can go is the place every other file goes. It was `.` until 2026-08-18, which
//! named the same directory in the only spelling that then existed.
//!
//! `/tmp` was the other candidate and it still loses, though the reason has narrowed. It no longer
//! *refuses*: since the namespace half, `/tmp/x` is `tmp/x` under the granted directory. That is
//! the problem. It names a subdirectory nothing creates, so every temporary file fails with
//! `NotFound` instead of landing somewhere, and it puts a Unix fiction in a string a program may
//! print. `/` names the one directory that is certainly there.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A temporary file lands in the program's granted directory, beside its real files.** There is
//!   no separate scratch space, because there is no second directory to grant one from. A caller
//!   that needs isolation should be given a directory of its own and use the `_in` variants
//!   (`tempfile_in`, `tempdir_in`), which take the directory rather than asking for one.
//! - **`tempfile` still does not work**, and removing this panic did not make it. Its platform
//!   ladder has no nife arm, so it selects `other.rs`, whose six functions all return "operation
//!   not supported on this platform". What changed is that the failure is now that crate's error
//!   instead of this platform's abort.
//! - **`chdir` refuses, so a `std` program cannot move.** `current_dir` answers `/` and always
//!   will: a process holds one directory capability, fixed at spawn, and there is no second place
//!   for it to be. Moving would mean this module holding a descent handle as mutable process state
//!   and resolving every relative name against it, which is buildable (it is the shell's stack, one
//!   level down) and is not built. A program that wants to work in a subdirectory should open it
//!   and use the `_in`/`Dir` forms, exactly as one that wants an isolated scratch space should.
//!   The asymmetry the previous version of this entry recorded, `getcwd` refusing while `temp_dir`
//!   answered, is gone: both name `/` and both come from the same place.
//! - **`split_paths` splits on `:` with no escaping**, so a path containing a colon cannot be
//!   carried in a list. Every Unix has the same hole and `join_paths` reports it as an error rather
//!   than producing a list that reads back wrong.
