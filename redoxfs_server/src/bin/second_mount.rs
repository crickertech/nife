//! **The second-mount repro, on the host** (fix/redoxfs-second-mount).
//!
//! A second mount of a *used* RedoxFS image fails its write on device. The open question is why, and
//! the recorded hypothesis is accumulated mount state driving the FS server past its 8 MiB heap cap.
//! This binary settles it without an emulator: it runs the real engine under the **same allocator the
//! FS server uses** (`user_heap`, the algorithm behind `user_rt::heap::UntypedHeap`), grown incrementally
//! and capped exactly the way `redoxfs_server.rs` caps it, and it does the two mounts in one process:
//!
//! 1. create the fixture image, then mount it and write (this is what makes the image *used*),
//! 2. drop the mount the way a dying process does (no unmount), then **mount again and write**.
//!
//! The disk image lives in a `static`, off the heap, because on device the image is on a disk reached
//! over blk IPC and never occupies the server's heap. Keeping it out is what makes the cap mean the
//! same thing here as there.
//!
//! The cap is the experiment's dial:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --manifest-path redoxfs_server/Cargo.toml --bin second_mount            # 8 MiB, the device cap
//! NIFE_HEAP_MIB=64 cargo run --manifest-path redoxfs_server/Cargo.toml --bin second_mount
//! ```
//!
//! If mount 2's write fails at 8 MiB and succeeds at 64, the failure is heap exhaustion and the
//! hypothesis holds. If it fails at both, or succeeds at both, the hypothesis is dead and the note
//! must say so instead of carrying a plausible-sounding guess.
