//! **The FS-server EL0 binary** (milestone 32 phase 2): RedoxFS, confined, served over IPC.
//!
//! The sans-IO core is [`redoxfs_server::Server`]; this file is only the two IO edges it needs and the
//! runtime a dedicated binary carries. Below it, the [`IpcDisk`] turns the RedoxFS `Disk` trait into
//! a **blk-IPC client**: a `read_at`/`write_at`/`size` is one or more `CALL`s to the block server,
//! up to `blk::TRANSFER_BLOCKS` contiguous filesystem blocks per call (milestone 138 step 4).
//! `IpcDisk` is itself wrapped in [`redoxfs_server::CachedDisk`] (step 2), which answers a repeated
//! single-block read (the tree spine `Transaction::read_tree_and_addr` walks fresh on every
//! `Server::read`/`write`/...) from memory instead of a second round trip. Above both, [`serve`]
//! turns file-service requests from clients into `Server` calls and answers through the one-shot
//! Reply the kernel mints. The allocator is the untyped-backed heap, so every byte RedoxFS
//! allocates is paid from this process's own budget, which is the whole reason phase 2 waited on
//! milestone 27's `GlobalAlloc`.
//!
//! # Capability contract (notes/fs-server.md, notes/abi.md §4)
//! - **slot 0**: an untyped budget, the heap's (RedoxFS is alloc-heavy; nothing runs without it).
//! - **slot 1**: the block-service endpoint, `WRITE`. The FS server is the block server's client.
//! - **slot 2**: the file-service endpoint, `READ`. Clients `CALL` here; this is the directory
//!   capability, bound in the server to the image's root (phase 2). A client without it opens
//!   nothing.
//! - **[`BLK_PAGE`]**: the base of the block channel shared with the block server, `blk::TRANSFER_MAX`
//!   bytes of contiguous pages (the block buffer).
//! - **[`FILE_PAGE`]**: the base of the file channel shared with the client, `fs::TRANSFER_MAX`
//!   bytes of contiguous pages (a name on open, file bytes on read/write).
//!
//! The server only ever OPENS the image (never creates: creation is std-gated and host-side), and
//! it maps RedoxFS's error type to the wire exactly once, in `Server::handle`, via `filesystem_protocol::reply_err`.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **Window 0 is still shared by the boot's long-lived clients** (milestone 599 (a frame per
//! filesystem client channel)). A job behind a directory grant gets a window of its own from the
//! progenitor's pool, and the server reads window `badge` for each request. The shell, `login`,
//! the identity provisioner and the progenitor's own activation calls all use window 0, and are
//! kept apart by being blocked, not by mapping: the progenitor calls only while the shell waits on
//! it, and nothing connects to `login` in the shipped boot. See `notes/page-frame-slice.md`.
