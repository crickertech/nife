//! **`mkfs`**: `mkfs` on the target (milestone 57's write half, notes/nifefs.md).
//!
//! The program that creates a filesystem, and the whole of its authority is two capabilities:
//!
//! - a **block-service endpoint** for **one** disk (`filesystem_proto::blk`), which is the power to destroy
//!   that disk and nothing else; and
//! - an **entropy endpoint** (`entropy_proto`), which is the power to obtain random bytes and
//!   nothing else. It cannot reach the virtio-rng device, program its queue, or see the DMA page.
//!
//! **That pair is sufficient and neither half is**, which is what this program exists to
//! demonstrate. A filesystem carries a unique id, and an id that is not random is not unique; the
//! vendored RedoxFS has no source of randomness in a `no_std` build, which is exactly why
//! `Header::new` is `std`-gated (it calls `getrandom` through `Uuid::new_v4`). Rather than give the
//! engine a random number generator, the engine now **takes the uuid as an argument**, the same way
//! `create` already takes `ctime` because it has no clock. See `vendor/README.md` divergence 4 and
//! `patches/redoxfs-no-std-create-uuid.patch`.
//!
//! So the capability boundary is where it should be: **the library computes, the program holds the
//! authority, and no randomness enters vendored code.**
//!
//! Compare `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3` as root, which reaches every disk in the machine and opens
//! `/dev/urandom` without asking anybody. Here a process with the disk and no entropy writes
//! nothing at all, and a process with entropy and no disk has nothing to write to. The kernel-side
//! test runs all three cases against the same binary.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! 1. Reads the partition table off the disk it holds and finds the **nife data partition**
//!    by type GUID (DECISIONS §45). Nothing here trusts a partition *name*: on any disk a Mac
//!    touched there is not one (notes/gpt.md).
//! 2. Draws sixteen random bytes, and stops if it cannot.
//! 3. Creates the filesystem **inside that partition**, through a [`PartitionDisk`] whose block
//!    zero is the partition's first block and whose `size` is the partition's length, so the engine
//!    cannot address a byte outside it even by arithmetic error.
//! 4. Reopens it through [`redoxfs_server::Server`] (the same code the FS server serves with) and writes
//!    one file, so that what lands on the platter is a filesystem with a tree in it rather than
//!    only a header.
//!
//! The order matters: **the entropy draw comes before the first write**, so a refusal leaves a
//! partition that still holds whatever it held.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//!   wired with a disk AND an entropy endpoint:
//!     report: R_MADE, 12288 blocks, ctime 0
//!
//!   wired with the disk and NO entropy endpoint:
//!     report: R_NO_ENTROPY                      (and the partition is untouched)
//!
//!   wired with entropy and NO disk:
//!     report: R_NO_DISK                         (there is nothing to write to)
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Every timestamp on the new filesystem is zero.** `create_reserved_with_uuid` takes `ctime`
//!   because the engine has no clock, and this program holds no clock capability either: it has a
//!   disk and an entropy endpoint, and nothing else. The honest thing is to pass zero rather than
//!   invent a plausible number, so a filesystem made on the target is dated 1970 until the wiring
//!   grows a `clock_proto` endpoint. A one-slot change, deliberately not taken here, because adding
//!   it would blur the two-capability claim this program is making.
//! - **It refuses a partition that is not 4096-aligned at both ends**, rather than rounding one in.
//!   A filesystem whose blocks straddle the partition's first byte reads back correctly through the
//!   offset disk that made it and is unreadable by everything else, which is the worst failure
//!   available.
//! - **No progress, no resume, and no confirmation.** It formats what it was handed the moment it
//!   runs. The confirmation a `mkfs` normally prints exists because the tool could have been aimed
//!   anywhere; this one was handed one partition of one disk.
//! - **The filesystem is unencrypted**, deliberately (roadmap milestone 57). RedoxFS encryption
//!   needs a salt and two keys, which are `getrandom` upstream; the `no_std` creation path refuses
//!   a password rather than silently making an unencrypted filesystem, so wiring one in later is a
//!   second entropy draw and not a surprise.
