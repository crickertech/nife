//! **Is RedoxFS actually crash consistent?** (milestone 37, DECISIONS §34 condition 1)
//!
//! DECISIONS §34 made RedoxFS the primary filesystem on three conditions, and the first was that
//! this stop being a claim. Crash consistency is the property the engine was chosen for and the
//! first thing a skeptic asks a filesystem, and until this file existed the evidence for it was the
//! upstream design description. That is the kind of claim this project's rules forbid.
//!
//! # The property, stated so it can fail
//!
//! A workload is a sequence of operations, each of which returns to its caller only after the
//! engine has committed it. Call the state of the filesystem after the first `p` of them `S(p)`.
//! Then:
//!
//! > **For every point at which the device could stop, the filesystem a fresh mount recovers is
//! > exactly `S(p)` for some `p`.** Not a blend of two states, not a half-applied operation, not a
//! > length nobody ever wrote, and not a mount that fails.
//!
//! That is prefix consistency, and it is strictly stronger than "every acknowledged write is either
//! wholly present or wholly absent": a state that is `S(p)` for some `p` contains operation `i`
//! whole or not at all, for every `i`, and it also rules out the state where a later operation
//! survived and an earlier one did not.
//!
//! Two further assertions turn that from a shape into a measurement. `p` must be **non-decreasing**
//! as the cut point advances, so recovery cannot be arbitrary and a later crash cannot lose more
//! than an earlier one. And at the last cut point, where nothing is lost at all, `p` must be the
//! whole workload, so a filesystem that recovered `S(0)` every time (perfectly prefix-consistent
//! and perfectly useless) fails here.
//!
//! # Determinism, because a crash harness that leaks state manufactures facts
//!
//! Every fault point starts from a byte-identical clone of one in-memory image, built in this
//! process by `FileSystem::create` and never written to. Nothing is read from disk, nothing carries
//! between iterations, and nothing carries between runs. DECISIONS §27 records a day lost to a gate
//! whose fixture one run mutated and another asserted on, producing three incompatible root causes
//! from three honest investigations; this is that lesson applied before the fact rather than after.
//!
//! # The controls
//!
//! `the_ring_is_what_saves_it` and `a_torn_commit_is_a_header_the_engine_rejects` are the negative
//! controls, and they are not optional. Without them a passing suite is equally consistent with an
//! injector that does nothing at all, which is the same discipline milestone 29's checker (it must
//! reject black, swapped channels, a one-pixel shift) and milestone 31's second attacker run apply.
