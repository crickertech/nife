//! The TLS 1.3 record layer: AES-128-GCM, AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 behind `rustls`'
//! `Tls13AeadAlgorithm`.
//!
//! **This is the file with the most opportunity to be wrong, and it computes nothing.** Every byte
//! of confidentiality and authenticity here comes from `aes-gcm` or `chacha20poly1305`, the two
//! crates in this graph that carry NCC Group's 2020 audit in their own README. What this file does
//! is assemble the record the way RFC 8446 section 5.2 says: plaintext, then the real content type
//! as one byte, then the tag, with a five-byte additional-data block that is the *outer* header.
//!
//! **The detached form is used on purpose.** `aes-gcm` offers both `encrypt_in_place`, which needs
//! a growable `aead::Buffer`, and `encrypt_in_place_detached`, which takes a plain `&mut [u8]` and
//! hands the tag back. `rustls`' buffers are its own types and implement neither `Buffer` nor
//! anything close, so the detached form is the one that does not require copying the record twice.
//!
//! **`rustls` supplies the nonce and the additional data**, through `Nonce::new` and
//! `make_tls13_aad`, and they are used rather than rewritten. Deriving a nonce is exactly the kind
//! of thing that looks like four lines and is a catastrophe when the sequence number is encoded
//! wrongly, and `rustls` has already made those four lines part of its own API.
