//! **A `rustls` crypto provider assembled in this tree, over primitives chosen deliberately**
//! for milestone 442 (a crypto provider `rustls` can use on all three bare-metal targets).
//!
//! # Why this exists rather than a dependency
//!
//! DECISIONS §196 (nife carries TLS: `rustls` for the protocol, and a crypto provider we make
//! work) ruled that nife carries TLS and that the provider under it is work rather than a
//! purchase. The one pure-Rust provider on crates.io is `rustls-rustcrypto`, and **calef refused
//! it** on 2026-09-20: *"rustls-rustcrypto doesn't seem like a high quality dependency."* Version
//! 0.0.2-alpha, published 2024-04-24, three versions ever and two of them yanked, pinning majors
//! of `sha2`, `aes-gcm` and `p256` that were all superseded during 2026.
//!
//! **That refusal is about the glue, not about the primitives**, which is why this crate is glue
//! and nothing else.
//!
//! # The §46 line, drawn out loud
//!
//! DECISIONS §46 (thin primitives or whole subsystems; we write everything in between) says this tree writes what is on the verification path and **takes** what is won
//! by exposure rather than by reading a specification, and it names cryptography as the second
//! kind in so many words: *"take it, do not write it."* So:
//!
//! - **Every cryptographic operation is taken.** AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, SHA-2, HMAC, X25519,
//!   P-256 and P-384 ECDSA, and Ed25519 all live in crates this package depends on. Their
//!   correctness includes constant-time behaviour and resistance to attacks no specification
//!   states, and `aes-gcm` and `chacha20poly1305` carry NCC Group's 2020 audit in their own README.
//! - **The glue is written, and glue is not cryptography.** A [`rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider`]
//!   is five fields: a cipher suite table, a key exchange group table, a signature verification
//!   algorithm table, a random source, and a private key loader. This crate fills them. It selects,
//!   names and plumbs; it computes nothing, and no operation in it is secret-dependent in a way a
//!   timing attack could read, because every secret-dependent operation is inside a primitive.
//! - **The one place the line could have been crossed is RSA**, and it was not. See `BUGS`.
//!
//! The honest accounting, which is in notes/cryptography-provider.md in full: measured the same
//! way, `rustls-rustcrypto`'s graph is **73 crates** and this one's is **53**, and the full
//! like-for-like comparison at equal algorithm coverage is 73 against 67. **The case for writing
//! this was never size.** It is that the glue is the piece with the least exposure in the whole
//! chain, so it is the piece worth owning.
//!
//! # What this provider supports
//!
//! **TLS 1.3 only.** `rustls`' `tls12` feature is off in this crate's manifest. A package client
//! talks to one host it was configured for, over a protocol version every such host has spoken for
//! years, and TLS 1.2 would add a second record layer, a second key schedule and RSA key transport
//! to a surface DECISIONS §196 already describes as the part that must stay small.
//!
//! | field | what this provides |
//! |---|---|
//! | `cipher_suites` | `TLS13_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`, `TLS13_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS13_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` |
//! | `kx_groups` | X25519, NIST P-256 |
//! | `signature_verification_algorithms` | ECDSA P-256/SHA-256, ECDSA P-384/SHA-384, Ed25519, and RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 and PSS with SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 |
//! | `secure_random` | the entropy service, through `entropy_backend` and `getrandom` |
//! | `key_provider` | refuses: this provider loads no private keys |
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```no_run
//! // The provider, ready to hand to `rustls`.
//! let provider = cryptography_provider::provider();
//! assert_eq!(provider.cipher_suites.len(), 3);
//! assert_eq!(provider.kx_groups.len(), 2);
//! ```
//!
//! On nife the consuming binary must also carry `use entropy_backend as _;` and the build
//! configuration in `cryptography_exerciser/.cargo/config.toml`, or the random source has no
//! backend and, on `x86_64-unknown-nife`, a primitive will execute an instruction the target has
//! no state for. Both are recorded where a reader meets them.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **An RSA key whose SPKI says `RSASSA-PSS` rather than `rsaEncryption` is not verified.** Both
//!   are legal; the second is what every certificate authority in the public web PKI issues, and
//!   the first is rare enough that `rustls`' own ring-backed table calls its PSS entries
//!   `..._LEGACY_KEY` for taking the same position. A chain using one fails closed.
//! - **A PKCS#1 v1.5 `AlgorithmIdentifier` with absent parameters is not verified.** The encoding
//!   should carry an explicit `NULL`, and some older certificates omit it; `rustls`' ring table
//!   carries separate `..._ABSENT_PARAMS` entries for exactly that. Both GitHub chains this
//!   milestone verified use the explicit form, so nothing here needed it yet.
//! - **No TLS 1.2**, by the choice above. A peer that offers nothing newer will fail to negotiate.
//! - **No client certificates.** `key_provider` refuses every private key, which is correct for a
//!   package client and wrong for anything that must authenticate itself.
//! - **Nothing here has completed a handshake.** The vectors in `cryptography_exerciser` prove the
//!   primitives compute what their specifications say and that this provider assembles and offers
//!   what it claims. No peer has ever answered it, because there is no HTTP client in the tree;
//!   that is milestone 442's clause 3, repriced into a proposal.
//! - **No FIPS claim anywhere.** Every `fips()` is left at its `false` default, which is the
//!   truthful answer and is stated so nobody reads the silence as a claim.
