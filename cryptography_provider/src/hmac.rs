//! HMAC behind `rustls`' `Hmac` trait, which is all `rustls` needs to build HKDF itself.
//!
//! `rustls::crypto::tls13::HkdfUsingHmac` turns an `Hmac` into the whole TLS 1.3 key schedule, so
//! this file is the only thing standing between `hmac` and a working schedule. That is worth
//! saying because the obvious alternative, implementing `Hkdf` directly over the `hkdf` crate, is
//! more code and more places to be wrong about a key derivation.

// they inherit `T`'s auto traits and would need a hand-written `unsafe impl` asserting the
// compiler is wrong, which `script/lint`'s unsafe-obligation count is right to object to. A
// function pointer returning `T` carries the same type information to the reader and is
// unconditionally `Send + Sync`, because it owns nothing.
