//! Key exchange: X25519 and NIST P-256, behind `rustls`' `SupportedKxGroup`.
//!
//! Two groups rather than one, because TLS 1.3 lets the server choose and a client that offers
//! only X25519 will fail against a peer configured for P-256 and the other way round. Both are in
//! the path for a reason that was measured rather than assumed: `github.com`'s certificate chain
//! is ECDSA P-256 throughout (notes/cryptography-provider.md), and X25519 is what almost every
//! modern server prefers for the exchange itself.
//!
//! **The ephemeral secret comes from the primitive crate, not from `rustls`' `SecureRandom`**, and
//! that is `rustls`' own design: its `SecureRandom` documentation says key exchange material "is
//! not included in the interface with rustls: it is assumed that the cryptography library provides
//! for this itself." Here both crates draw through `rand_core`'s `OsRng`, which on nife is
//! `entropy_backend` and the entropy service, so the two paths end in the same place anyway.
