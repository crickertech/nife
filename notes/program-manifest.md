# The program manifest: a component contract in embryo

Milestone 31, phase 1. A **manifest** is a program's declared endowment: what it expects to be
granted, written down where the shell can check a command against it before spawning anything. It
is the SHILL idea (OSDI 2014: capability contracts for scripts) shrunk to what phase 1 needs, and
it is milestone 23's component contract in its smallest honest form. The type and the checker live
in `grant_plan` (host-tested); this note is the why and the format.

## The problem it solves

Without a manifest, a mismatch between what a command grants and what a program needs surfaces late
and badly. Grant a program too little and it hangs or faults deep inside, on a capability it assumed
was in a slot that is empty. Grant it something it does not understand and the authority leaks
silently. Both are mystery failures at runtime, far from the command that caused them.

The manifest moves the failure to the prompt. The shell checks the command's grants against the
named program's manifest **at spawn**, before a child exists, so a mismatch is a legible refusal on
the line you typed:

```text
$ budgeter
  budgeter: needs a memory grant; add --mem <pages>
```

Nothing was built, nothing hung. The contract was checked where you could still read it.

## The format

A manifest declares what a program expects to be handed (`grant_plan::Manifest`):

```rust
struct Manifest {
    arg:           ArgSpec,     // Required | Forbidden   -- an integer argument?
    mem:           MemSpec,     // Forbidden | Required { min, max }  -- a memory grant, in pages?
    file:          FileSpec,    // Forbidden | Required { writable }  -- one file
    dir:           DirSpec,     // a directory capability, and with which rights
    flags:         &'static [u8],  // the option letters the program accepts
    output:        OutputSpec,  // where its bytes may go
    input:         InputSpec,   // and where they may come from; Required carries
                                // writes_while_reading, which the type will not let you omit
    reports:       bool,        // is it endowed the shared result endpoint?
    interruptible: bool,        // does ^C reach it (DECISIONS §24)?
    clock:         bool,        // may it read the wall clock?
    domain:        bool,        // may it name the processes in its supervision domain?
    config:        bool,        // may it read TZ/LANG/TERM off the inert config page?
    entropy:       bool,        // may it ask the entropy service for random bytes?
}
```

**The struct in `crates/grant_plan/src/lib.rs` is the authority, not this page.** This list said
five fields against the code's ten from some point before 2026-08-14, when milestone 117's first
stranger run found it and reported that following the note produces a struct that does not compile.
It then carried `reports` and `interruptible` twice, and was missing `domain`, `config` and
`entropy`, until 2026-09-05. The program table below is the same hazard at smaller scale: it shows a
few programs and the enum carries more.

**The last four are one family and they are the ones a newcomer misreads.** Every other field is
about something the command line can designate; these four are about authority no token can name, so
there is nothing to type and nothing to refuse. What they do is tell **init** which children to
endow, and tell a person reading `caps <program>` that the authority exists at all. `clock` and
`config` are read-only page mappings; `domain` and `entropy` are endpoints placed at named slots
(`grant_plan::DOMAIN_SLOT`, `ENTROPY_SLOT`), narrowed to `ENUMERATE` and `WRITE` respectively.

`entropy` is the one worth pausing on, because randomness is the authority whose use leaves no trace:
a process that draws a key and a process that hardcodes one make the same syscalls and produce
output of the same shape. The declaration is the only thing that tells them apart, which is why
ambient entropy would be ambient authority (DECISIONS §44, notes/entropy.md).

### The file endowment declares a direction, not a name

`FileSpec::Required { writable }` is the phase-2 addition, and the interesting part is the split it
makes: **the manifest declares the direction, the command line designates the file.** So `wc
report.txt` reads and `tee report.txt` writes, and the human never types a mode.

That is SHILL's shape and it is the right one on both halves. Whether a program writes is a property
of what the program does; it is fixed, publishable, and not the caller's to guess. Which file it
should touch is entirely the caller's business and belongs on the line. Authority is still exactly
what the command says, because the program's half is written down where the shell (and the human) can
read it: `caps run wc file:report.txt` prints "read-only, and nothing else on the disk".

One file, not a list. A program that needs two needs a manifest that says so, and that is a later
widening rather than something to leave ambiguous now.

The programs a `Manifest` is written for (the two interrupt demonstrators, `heeder` and `spinner`,
declare nothing but `interruptible`):

| program    | arg        | mem                  | file      | reports |
|------------|------------|----------------------|-----------|---------|
| `worker`   | Required   | Forbidden            | Forbidden | yes     |
| `budgeter` | Forbidden  | Required 1..=64 pages | Forbidden | yes     |
| `date`     | Forbidden  | Forbidden            | Forbidden | yes     |

**`date`'s row is all `Forbidden`, and that is the interesting one.** Its authority is a read-only
mapping of the clock page, which init endows and the command line cannot name: there is nothing to
type, so there is nothing to get wrong. What the manifest still does is refuse everything else, so a
memory grant or a file aimed at a clock reader stops at the prompt rather than being handed over and
ignored. A manifest is as much about what a program will *not* accept as what it needs.

No shipped program declares a file yet, because the shell it would be spawned from holds no directory
to narrow (notes/grant-expression.md says why, and why that refusal is true rather than pending). The
`FileSpec::Required` logic is not therefore untested: `plan_against` takes an **explicit** manifest
rather than reading the static table, so the host tests check a manifest shape no program declares.
That split was worth making anyway, because milestone 23 needs exactly it: a manifest that travels
with a component, checked by a composer that did not write the program.

`worker` needs its `n` and no memory; granting `--mem` to it is a refusal. `budgeter` exists to
spend a budget, so it *requires* `--mem` (the lower bound of 1 makes "budgeter with no grant" a
refusal), with an upper bound the shell's own budget can actually back.

## The check, and its order

`grant_plan::plan` resolves a parsed invocation against the manifest and yields either an `Endowment`
(exactly what to grant) or a typed `Refusal`. The order is: the program name (a name that resolves
to nothing is a fact about the system, and everything after it is a fact about a program that
exists), then a flag nothing knows, then **the positional tokens placed into the slots the manifest
declares** (the integer argument, then the file), then the memory rules.

Placing the tokens is what milestone 47 moved out of the parser. The parser knows a token's shape;
only the manifest knows what a token *is*, which is why `wc 2026` designates a file named `2026`
rather than an argument nobody declared. Two refusals fall out of the same rule:

- a token past the last declared slot cannot be placed, so `worker 5 extra` is refused. That is the
  safety property the `file:` prefix used to be credited with, and it was always the manifest's.
- inside a file slot, what the *shell holds* decides whether the designation can be backed at all:
  "you hold no such capability" beats "and that name is too long", because it is the bigger fact.

Each refusal carries a fixed message (`Refusal::message`), host-tested so the wording cannot drift,
and the shell prefixes the program name. The strings are part of the deliverable: a refusal must
read like the capability model, not like errno. See [grant-expression.md](grant-expression.md) for
the full refusal catalog.

## Why it lives in the shell, not the kernel

The manifest is a **userspace** contract, checked by the party doing the granting. The kernel does
not read it, does not enforce it, and does not need to: even if the shell skipped the check and
granted a program too little, the program would fault on an empty slot and die, harming only itself,
because there is no ambient authority to fall back on. The manifest is not a security boundary; the
capability model is. The manifest is a **usability** boundary, turning a deep mystery hang into a
one-line refusal at the prompt. That is exactly the altitude SHILL's contracts sit at, and exactly
what milestone 23's components will formalize: a component that declares the capabilities it needs,
checked by whoever wires it up, so a bad wiring is caught at composition, not at runtime.

## What grows from here

- **milestone 23** turns this from a static table keyed by program name into a contract a component
  *ships with*, so the shell (or any composer) checks a program it did not write against the
  program's own declaration. The shape is the same; the manifest just travels with the binary.
- **milestone 32** adds file and directory grants to the endowment vocabulary, so a manifest can
  declare "one readable file" and the checker can match a designated name against it. The
  `ArgSpec`/`MemSpec` pattern extends directly to a `FileSpec`.
- **milestone 47** will have to grow `ArgSpec` into something with **position and arity** the first
  time a program wants both an argument and a file (`grep pattern file.txt`), or wants two of
  either. Today's rule (the argument takes the first positional, the file the next) is unambiguous
  only because at most one bare token can be a file. `date` is already pressing on this: it reads
  three registers (format, UTC offset, provenance) and declares `ArgSpec::Forbidden`, so the shell
  spawns it with the defaults and its selectors are unreachable from the prompt.
