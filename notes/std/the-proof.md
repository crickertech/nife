# The proof: one binary, three behaviours

*An appendix to [`notes/std.md`](../std.md), which is the page to read. This file holds what
`std_exerciser` does under each grant, and which kernel tests spawn it. It was moved here verbatim
from the main page on 2026-09-25 (UTC), under [§212 (a prose
budget)](../../design/decisions/212-a-prose-budget-for-every-document.md). The directory
`notes/std/` and this file's stem are provisional names, minted that day by the lane that split the
file; naming is calef's.*

The records this file cites by number:

- milestone 122 (a directory handle `std` can hold)
- milestone 31 (a capability shell)
- §27 (the filesystem service)
- milestone 64 (enough `std` to run somebody else's crate)
- milestone 47 (navigation and naming)
- §19 (architectural parity is a tenet)


## The proof

`std_exerciser/src/main.rs` is an ordinary Rust program, no `no_std`, no `unsafe`, and two
`#![feature]` gates that are both about **an API's stability upstream rather than about this
platform**: `std::random` (rust-lang/rust#130703) and, since milestone 122, `std::fs::Dir`
(rust-lang/rust#120426). A program on any target calling those opts in the same way. It is
**one binary with three behaviours, chosen by the authority it was granted**: on start it probes for
a directory capability (`File::open` on the fixture name) and then for the network (a single
`UdpSocket::bind`), and the results branch it.

- **Granted a directory** (slot 4 and the shared page, alongside a running FS service): the open
  succeeds, and the program reads the file with `Read` and again with `read_to_string`, stats it,
  overwrites the image's `scratch` file and reads it back, and gets refused on `/etc/passwd`,
  `../motd`, and `sub/motd`. Since milestone 31 phase 2 it also **creates** a name the image does not
  carry with `std::fs::write`, writes it a second time with a *shorter* payload, and asserts the
  read-back equals the shorter one: without `TRUNCATE` that second write would leave the first one's
  tail behind, which is the whole of §27's four-times-corrected bug pinned at the top level rather
  than only in a host test. `create_new` over the name it just made is `AlreadyExists`, and creating
  `/tmp/escape` or `../escape` is refused exactly as opening them is, so `CREATE` did not widen what a
  client can reach. Since milestone 64 it then walks the **namespace** verbs: makes a directory,
  lists the granted directory and finds both the fixture (a file) and the directory it just made
  (marked as one), descends into that directory and finds it empty, gets refused unlinking a
  directory and rmdir-ing a file, renames the file it created and asserts the *source name is gone*
  as well as the destination's contents, then removes both. Since milestone 122 it then **descends**:
  it reads a file one directory down and another two down, builds a small tree of its own and lists
  it, opens every file that listing named through the `path()` the listing handed back (the pair that
  used to break), gets refused a path that walks through a file, opens a file under a held
  `std::fs::Dir` and gets refused `..` through it, renames between two directories in one message,
  and removes the tree with `remove_dir_all`. **The tree it lists is one it built**, deliberately,
  and not the fixture's `sub`: milestone 47's directory-capability attacker is granted exactly that
  directory and writes into it, so `sub`'s contents depend on which tests ran first in this boot, and
  the first version of this transcript asserted them and failed. `sub/inner` and `sub/deeper/leaf`
  are safe to *read* because the post-run host check pins them. It cleans up before it starts rather
  than after, because `NIFE_KEEP_REDOXFS=1` runs the suite against an image a previous boot
  wrote. The kernel test `std_fs_reads_a_file_through_a_granted_directory_capability` spawns it this
  way.
- **Granted the network** (slots 2 and 3, alongside a running net_stack): the bind succeeds, and the
  program does a real UDP DNS query to slirp's resolver and a TCP echo round trip to slirp's
  guestfwd peer, both through `std::net` and both asserted. The kernel test
  `std_net_runs_over_the_socket_contract` spawns it this way.
- **Granted neither** (only slots 0 and 1): both probes return `Unsupported`, and the program runs
  the offline transcript, exercising `Vec` (10,000-element collect against the untyped heap),
  `String`, `HashMap` (the random seed), `Instant` (asserted monotonic and advancing), and the
  honesty of `fs` and `net`. The kernel test `std_tests::a_whole_std_program_runs_on_the_native_abi`
  spawns it this way.

The same binary doing three things by its grants alone is the point of "no ambient authority": the
code never chose to have a network or a filesystem, its capability table did. All three tests reassemble the
byte stream off the endpoint and compare it byte for byte, on **both** ISAs out of each arch's own
initrd (the parity gate, DECISIONS §19). The fs transcript splices the file's own bytes into the
expected buffer from the shared fixture, so that one comparison covers the whole path: disk,
DMA-confined block server, FS server running an engine we did not write, the file contract, the PAL,
and the stdout endpoint. One binary also keeps the initrd inside its nifefs directory limit
(`nifefs::MAX_FILES`, 31 entries when this was written and 76 since 2026-08-01).
`cargo xtask test` builds the demo for both targets first, so both initrds carry it; both test legs
attach a virtio-net NIC (`NIFE_NET`) with the guestfwd echo peer and the RedoxFS image as the
second disk.

**One boot has one FS service**, because the block server owns the RedoxFS device: a second wiring
would put a second driver on the same virtio slot and re-bind its interrupt. So `fs_service`
remembers what it wired, and the hand-written client's test and the `std::fs` test share one
instance; whichever runs first receives the two readiness sentinels (each is sent once) and the other
sees `None` and skips those assertions. That keeps the two tests order-independent, which matters
because nothing guarantees which of them the harness runs first.
