# `std::net` over the socket contract

*An appendix to [`notes/std.md`](../std.md), which is the page to read. This file holds how
`TcpStream`, `TcpListener` and `UdpSocket` map onto net_stack's socket contract, and the port-reuse
finding. It was moved here verbatim from the main page on 2026-09-25 (UTC), under [§212 (a prose
budget)](../../design/decisions/212-a-prose-budget-for-every-document.md). The directory
`notes/std/` and this file's stem are provisional names, minted that day by the lane that split the
file. Naming is calef's.*

The records this file cites by number:

- milestone 27 (Rust `std` on the native ABI)
- §25 (socket identity)
- milestone 64 (enough `std` to run somebody else's crate)
- milestone 55 (Time Machine)


## `std::net` over the socket contract (milestone 27 phase two)

`sys/net/connection/nife.rs` binds std's `TcpStream` and outbound `UdpSocket` to net_stack's socket
contract (DECISIONS §25, notes/net.md, `crates/socket_protocol/src/lib.rs`). The PAL is a client of
the frozen contract, nothing more. It holds the `Stack` endpoint (slot 2) and a frame untyped (slot
3). For each socket it mints a shared `Frame`, maps it, delegates it to net_stack (`SEND_CAP`,
`OP_ATTACH_FRAME`), and then drives the socket with `CALL`s carrying a socket id. Control words ride
the message; bytes sit in the shared frame. This is the exact path the hand-written
`socket_test_client` client walks, reached through std's blocking API instead.

The wire constants are not restated: `netproto.rs` is generated verbatim from
`crates/socket_protocol/src/lib.rs` into `sys/pal/nife/netproto.rs` by `std-src`, the same
anti-drift discipline as `abi.rs` and `user_mode_heap.rs`. If the contract changes, the PAL's
numbers change with it, because there is one source.

What binds, and how it maps to the contract:

- `TcpStream::{connect, read, write, ...}` -> `OP_OPEN_TCP`, `OP_CONNECT`, `OP_RECV`, `OP_SEND`,
  `OP_CLOSE` (on `Drop`). `read` blocks in net_stack until data arrives (a blocked `RECV`), the
  blocking semantics std's default API wants. A short `read` keeps the segment's tail in a
  per-socket residual buffer, so a stream never drops bytes.
- `UdpSocket::{bind, connect, send, recv, send_to, recv_from}` -> `OP_OPEN_UDP`, `OP_SENDTO`,
  `OP_RECV`. UDP `connect` only fixes a default peer (no contract call, matching Unix). `bind`'s
  local address is validated but not honored: net_stack assigns an ephemeral local port.
- Errors map by meaning, no errno. A refused TCP connect is `ConnectionRefused`; a net_stack timeout
  on `RECV` is `TimedOut`; a datagram larger than the frame is `InvalidInput`; an IPv6 address is
  `Unsupported` (net_stack is IPv4-only). A `CALL` on an empty `Stack` slot (no network granted)
  reads back negative and becomes `Unsupported`, the same answer a program with no net grants gets.

- `TcpListener::{bind, accept}` -> `OP_LISTEN` and `OP_ACCEPT` (milestone 64). This is the inbound
  half, and the reason it reads differently from everything above is that a listening port is an
  authority this program was granted or was not. `net_stack` is spawned with a listen grant, an
  inclusive port range, and refuses `LISTEN` outside it; `NO_LISTEN_GRANT` is the default, so a std
  program on a stack nobody granted ports to is refused every port there is. The three contract
  answers map to three `ErrorKind`s that tell a caller three different things to do. `LISTEN_DENIED`
  is `PermissionDenied` (ask whoever spawned you; no other port will help), `LISTEN_IN_USE` is
  `AddrInUse` (pick another port), and a refused `ACCEPT` is `WouldBlock` (the listener is still
  armed, call again). The `std_net` test boot runs this as its negative control: the same binary
  prints `listen refused` on a stack granted no ports, on aarch64 and riscv64.

  A listener and a connection are two socket ids, and the listener never gets a frame. That is
  DECISIONS §25 showing through the PAL rather than a choice made here: the shared frame is the
  granted resource and a listener carries no bytes, so it has nothing to grant. `accept` allocates a
  *second* id, attaches that one's frame, and asks `OP_ACCEPT` to install the connection there.
  `net_stack` refuses an accept into the listener's own id, so the POSIX move of turning a listening
  descriptor into the connection in place is not expressible from this PAL.

  The peer address is `0.0.0.0:0`, and it is a placeholder named as one. `accept` must return a
  `SocketAddr` and the contract's reply carries no peer; reporting the real one is a wire change and
  therefore a fork rather than a PAL decision (notes/net.md carries the two options).

The concurrency model is the contract's: single-threaded, one synchronous exchange at a time. A
program can hold up to `MAX_SOCKETS` (6, raised from 4 by milestone 55) sockets at once and
interleave them, but there is only ever
one operation in flight, which is all a single-threaded process can do anyway. For a listener that
means the backlog is one connection deep: the listener re-arms inside `ACCEPT`, so serving
connections one after another works indefinitely, and serving two at once does not.

A finding, recorded honestly. net_stack derives a socket's local port from its socket id
(`LOCAL_PORT_BASE + sid`), so an id is not an ephemeral port that rotates; reopening a just-closed
id reuses its exact local port. Against QEMU's slirp, a TCP connect that reuses a port whose
previous flow has not cleared stalls (the SYN's answer never comes, and net_stack blocks in its
bounded poll on the NIC interrupt). The PAL softens this by handing out ids round-robin, so
consecutive opens prefer different ids and ports, but a program that churns through more than
`MAX_SOCKETS` sockets quickly can still hit a reused port. The real fix is net_stack assigning
ephemeral local ports independent of the socket id, which is a contract-side change reported up, not
a client workaround. The demo sidesteps it by keeping its UDP and TCP sockets on distinct ids at
once.
