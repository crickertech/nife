# File times: `modified` and `set_times`

*An appendix to [`notes/std.md`](../std.md), which is the page to read. This file holds milestone
64's last pass: the mapping for each time call, why the handle shapes refuse, its EXAMPLES and its
BUGS. It was moved here verbatim from the main page on 2026-09-25 (UTC), under [§212 (a prose
budget)](../../design/decisions/212-a-prose-budget-for-every-document.md). The directory
`notes/std/` and this file's stem are provisional names, minted that day by the lane that split the
file; naming is calef's.*

The records this file cites by number:

- milestone 64 (enough `std` to run somebody else's crate)
- milestone 47 (navigation and naming)
- §112 (`touch`'s two behaviors need two rights)


## File times: `modified` and `set_times` (milestone 64's last pass, 2026-09-19)

**Neither was waiting on the contract, for three weeks**, which is the fifth time this module has
recorded that exact sentence. Milestone 47's `touch` lane added `GETMTIME`, `SETMTIME` and
`SETMTIME_AT` on 2026-08-24 (DECISIONS §112); this note and the PAL's comments went on saying "no
verb reports one" until 2026-09-19, and milestone 64's block carried the binding as its last
outstanding item.

**The mapping, verb by verb:**

| `std` call | what it does here |
|---|---|
| `std::fs::metadata(p).modified()`, `DirEntry::metadata().modified()` | **Bound.** `stat` walks to the directory holding the name (asking `dir::READ`, as it always did), runs `OPEN`/`FSTAT`/`CLOSE` for the size and kind, then `GETMTIME` for the time. Works for a directory as for a file. |
| `std::fs::set_times(p, t)`, `set_times_nofollow`, `FileTimes::set_modified` | **Bound**, always to `SETMTIME_AT` with the caller's seconds, walking with `dir::WRITE \| dir::SETTIME`. Sub-second part truncated. |
| `File::metadata().modified()`, `Dir::metadata().modified()` | **Refused**, `Unsupported`: the contract asks by name and a handle has none. |
| `File::set_times`, `File::set_modified` | **Refused**, `Unsupported`, same reason. |
| `FileTimes::set_accessed` passed to `set_times` | **Refused whole**, `Unsupported`, and nothing is changed: no verb sets an access time. |
| `metadata(".")` / `metadata("/")`, `set_times(".")` | The granted directory itself has no name; `modified()` and `set_times` refuse. |
| `accessed()`, `created()` | **Refused**: no verb carries either. |
| `SETMTIME` (set to the server's own "now") | **Not used by std**, deliberately (below). |

**Why the handle shapes refuse rather than remember the name.** The PAL could record the name a
`File` was opened by and ask `GETMTIME` with it. The answer would be about whatever holds that name
*now*: after a rename it would report another file's time, after an unlink a `NotFound` for a file
the caller is holding open, and `set_times` the same way would stamp the wrong file and return `Ok`.
POSIX's `fstat` and `futimens` act on the inode, and a binding that silently acted on a name instead
is the answer-instead-of-refusing failure this note keeps recording. A handle-taking form is a wire
change and is proposed in design/roadmap/504-an-mtime-for-an-open-file.md.

**Why `set_times` never falls back to `SETMTIME`.** A `SystemTime` from the caller is an assertion
about history even when it came from `SystemTime::now()`, and §112 put that authority behind
`dir::SETTIME`, separate from `dir::WRITE`. So a grant without `SETTIME` answers
`ReadOnlyFilesystem`. Falling back to `SETMTIME` would write the server's own "now" instead of the
time asked for and report success, and that "now" is not a time at all (next paragraph).

**A refused `GETMTIME` does not fail `metadata()`.** The size and the kind are still true, and a
`metadata()` that failed because one field could not be read would break every caller that only
wanted `is_dir()`. The reply word is kept and `modified()` reports it. Through a per-file grant the
caretaker refuses all three mtime verbs with `ENOTDIR` (it has no directory to resolve a name
under), and `modified()` says that in its message rather than reporting `NotADirectory`, which would
read as a fact about the file.

EXAMPLES, as `std_exerciser` runs them on all three architectures:

```rust
let t = std::fs::metadata("motd")?.modified()?;          // the host tool's stamp: a real second
std::fs::write("f", b"x")?;
std::fs::set_times("f", FileTimes::new().set_modified(t))?; // SETMTIME_AT, needs WRITE | SETTIME
assert_eq!(std::fs::metadata("f")?.modified()?, t);       // whole seconds round-trip
let f = File::open("f")?;
assert_eq!(f.metadata()?.modified().unwrap_err().kind(), ErrorKind::Unsupported);
```

BUGS:

- **A file written on nife reads as early 1970.** The FS server holds no clock, so every mutation
  stamps `Server::clock`, a counter that starts at 1 on each mount (notes/touch.md's `BUGS`). The
  contract says Unix seconds and the PAL reports what the contract says, so `modified()` of a file
  this system wrote is `UNIX_EPOCH` plus a few seconds. It orders correctly against other writes in
  the same boot, wrongly against files the host tool made (those carry real seconds), and wrongly
  across a reboot. The PAL cannot detect it, because `SETMTIME_AT` may legitimately assert a small
  number. Proposed as its own work: design/roadmap/497-a-filesystem-server-that-knows-the-time.md.
- **A write on nife never moves a real timestamp.** The engine (`vendor/redoxfs`'s `write_node` and
  `truncate_node`) only ever moves an mtime *forward*, and the server's counter is always behind a
  real second. So a file the host tool made keeps its host time through every write this system
  makes to it, and a file `set_times` put in the future stays there. Found by `std_exerciser`'s
  first draft, which asserted a write moved a `set_times` value and failed; the test now asserts a
  write moving a *made* file forward, before the `set_times`, which is what the stamp can promise.
- **Whole seconds only.** The wire carries seconds and the server stores a zero nanosecond part, so
  `set_times` truncates. A second-granularity filesystem does the same on Unix and std documents
  precision as platform-dependent, so this is recorded rather than refused.
- **A time past `i64::MAX` seconds is refused**, though the server would accept it: `GETMTIME`'s
  reply word is signed, so the time could be written and never read back.
- **`metadata` costs four messages plus the walk**, where it cost three, and `DirEntry::metadata` of a
  directory now costs a walk where it used to cost nothing (it answered from the listing, with no
  time). The four messages are not atomic: a name replaced between `OPEN` and `GETMTIME` reports the
  new node's time with the old node's size.
- **Not exercised through a narrowed grant from `std`.** Every std test grants the mount root with
  every right, so the `ReadOnlyFilesystem` a grant without `SETTIME` answers is proved by
  `redoxfs_server`'s host tests (the rights table beside `settime_at`) rather than through this PAL.
  The same gap [the descent
  section](fs-descent.md#what-is-proven-and-what-is-not) records for `OPENDIR`, and closed the same way.
