# Adding a user program

Task-oriented, because milestone 117's first stranger run found that **no file described this**. It
used to be long because the tree was: until milestone 150 (2026-09-19) a program's name went into
seven hand-maintained places and this page was an eighth. It is now **one place for a program, and
four for one the shell can spawn** (five if it answers in a register), and only the first two of
those are places you have to remember: the build or a host test sends you to each of the rest. What follows is what survived, not a description of what went.

A program is a `[[bin]]` in one of two packages, running at EL0, linked against `user_mode_runtime`.

## Which package: `components/` or `fixtures/`?

**Decide this first**, because it picks the directory and the `Cargo.toml` every later step edits.
Milestone 175 split `user/` on 2026-09-13, and the question it answers is *would a distribution ship
this because somebody wants its function?*

- **`components/`** if yes: a service, a driver, the progenitor and supervision spine, or a tool a person
  invokes at the prompt. `net_stack`, `gpu_driver`, `progenitor`, `wc`, `rm`, `date`.
- **`fixtures/`** if no: the program exists to exercise or measure the system. Test clients,
  attackers that share the honest path, stand-in servers, workloads, benchmarks. `chatty`,
  `outlaw`, `coremark`, `soaker`, `interrupt_ignorer`.

**"Who calls it" is not the test**, and getting that wrong is the easy mistake: nearly everything
here is reached only from a kernel test, `disk_partitioner` and `timetable` included, because this
system has one user. What separates them is what the program *is*.

## One program does one thing

**A behaviour is a program, not a role.** The tempting shortcut, when a fixture already exists that
is nearly what you want, is to add an arm to its `match` on `x0` and select the new behaviour with
a number. Do not. calef, 2026-09-14: *"Part of the beauty of Unix that I think we want to retain is
small programs with specific functions"*, and, on the binary that had accumulated thirty-one arms,
*"31 role binary is not the right shape."*

The cost is not aesthetic. A role is dispatched on a word the kernel puts in `x0`, so it is a value
the kernel's wiring and the program agree on that nothing checks; its name lives in a `const` two
files apart rather than in the archive; the binary links everything every role needs, so a fixture
spawned to prove one syscall drags in an ELF parser; and the program's name has to describe all of
them at once, which it stops doing at about the third.

**Milestone 291 is the worked example.** `fixtures/src/hello.rs` reached thirty-one roles one
convenient arm at a time over two months. Seven of them were an exact duplicate of
`components/src/block_driver.rs`, a whole program nobody had noticed was already there, kept alive
only because one archive table did not pack it; fourteen more became programs. See
[291](../design/roadmap/291-one-program-one-job.md).

**The exception is allowed and has to say so** (AGENTS.md's ladder, rung four's rule). If two
behaviours genuinely are one program, write down in the module doc why, where a reader meets it.
`hello`'s remaining nine do: six of them build a child and three of them *are* that child, which is
a relationship rather than a convenience.

## The steps

### 1. The source

`components/src/<name>.rs` or `fixtures/src/<name>.rs`, `snake_case` (DECISIONS §39, and the
convention table in [naming.md](../design/naming.md)). `no_std`, against `user_mode_runtime`.

### 2. A provenance block in its module doc

```rust
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-08-14 for <what it does>.
```

**`script/lint` fails without one**, via `script/names --check`. Three states: `ratified` (calef
ruled, with the date and what was refused), `recorded` (the tree argues the name somewhere, with a
citation), `unrecorded` (nothing outside this block says why). **The gate checks presence, never
`ratified`**, so an unratified name never blocks a build and `unrecorded` is a truthful answer.

**The name is calef's** (AGENTS.md, "calef names the crates, the programs, and the shared modules").
Ship a provisional one, say so in your report, expect it to change.

**Write `provisional` when you expect the name to change**, which is AGENTS.md's word and, since
§89 (2026-08-16), the gate's too. Four states:

```
Name: ratified 2026-08-04 (calef, milestone 63). Refused `x` (why).
Name: recorded (milestone 46). <what the tree already argues, and where>
Name: provisional. <what you called it and why you expect it to change>
Name: unrecorded. <what the history does and does not say>
```

`provisional` is a claim about **intent** (you expect this to change); the other three are claims
about the **record**. A settled name can be `unrecorded` (nobody wrote down why `hello` is called
`hello`, and nobody needs to), so the two are not the same word for the same thing.

`script/names --provisional` lists them and they sort first in `--unratified`, because a name its
own author called wrong is the shortest conversation calef can have. This page told newcomers the
opposite until §89: run 2 of the stranger test wrote the word AGENTS.md asked for and got a red
gate, which is what raised the decision.

### 3. A `[[bin]]` block in that package's `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[[bin]]
name = "your_program"
path = "src/your_program.rs"
test = false
bench = false
```

`test` and `bench` off are **mandatory**, not tidiness: the default libtest harness needs
`extern crate test`, which does not exist for a bare-metal target.

**That block is the whole of step 3, and of packing.** `xtask` reads the `[[bin]]` blocks of both
packages (`declared_programs()`) and packs every one into all three archives, aarch64, riscv64 and
`x86_64`, under its own name. There is no packing table to edit and no per-architecture filter; see
"Why it works this way" below for what that replaced and why a program that cannot run on some
architecture is packed there anyway. **You do not touch the measurement table either**: `xtask`
hashes every entry of the archive it just packed and writes the table the progenitor measures
against from that (`write_measure_manifest`).

The reader is strict on purpose. A key it does not know inside a `[[bin]]` block
(`required-features`, say) stops the pack with the key named, rather than packing an archive with
that program silently missing.

### 4. Keep the name under 32 bytes

`nifefs` caps `NAME_LEN` at 32, raised from 24 so `os_primitives_benchmarker` would fit. Raising
it again costs directory entries per block, so do not let a name spend it.

**There is also a ceiling on how many programs an archive holds**, `nifefs::MAX_FILES`, 127 since
milestone 291 raised `DIR_BLOCKS` from 6 to 10. Every archive packs 87 programs plus up to five
optional entries as of 2026-09-19, so the headroom is about thirty. It fails loudly: `write_image`
returns `TooManyFiles` and each `initrd_*` function prints the error, the file count and the size.

### 5. If the shell should be able to spawn it

Three edits, and after the first the machine names each of the others.

1. **A row in `programs!`** in `crates/grant_plan/src/lib.rs`, with its doc comment:

   ```rust
   /// Triples its integer argument (milestone N, `components/src/triple.rs`).
   Triple { id: 13, name: "triple" },
   ```

   `name` is the `[[bin]]` name. **`id` is the stable wire id**: the shell sends it and the
   progenitor decodes it, so it is a thing two programs agree on and changing it later is a flag
   day. Take the next unused number; never reuse a removed program's id (the build refuses a
   duplicate, and `the_wire_ids_already_shipped_never_move` refuses reuse of any id shipped before
   milestone 150). The enum, `name()`, `id()`, `from_id()`, `from_name()`, `Prog::ALL` and
   `PROG_COUNT` are all generated from the row.
2. **Its `manifest()` arm**, which the compiler asks for (`E0004` in `grant_plan`). This carries all
   of the actual meaning: see "What you declare" below.
3. **A line in `SHELL_CHECK_SCRIPT`** in `xtask/src/shell_check.rs`, and the array length the compiler then
   asks for. The element is a `(&str, &[&str])` pair, one line typed and the substrings its answer
   must contain: `("triple 21", &["21*3 = 63"]),`. The host test
   `every_spawnable_program_has_a_shell_check_line` fails until the line exists, and names the one
   exception it allows (a program a transcript cannot drive, listed with the reason).

**And a fourth only if your manifest says `output: OutputSpec::Words`**, meaning the answer is a
number in a register rather than a stream: an arm in `write_outcome` in `crates/swish/src/lib.rs`
that renders it. `every_program_that_answers_in_words_renders_its_answer` fails without one. A
byte-stream program needs nothing there.

`xtask` refuses to pack an archive when a `programs!` row names a program no `[[bin]]` builds, so
getting the name wrong in step 1 is a build failure rather than a program that cannot be spawned.

## What you declare: the manifest

The manifest is the program's endowment, and the shell checks it **at the prompt, before a child
exists**. A mismatch is a legible refusal on the line you typed rather than a hang deep inside a
program that assumed a slot was full. See [grant-expression.md](grant-expression.md) and
[program-manifest.md](program-manifest.md).

**The manifest declares the direction; the command line designates the file.** Whether a program
writes is a fixed, publishable property of it. Which file it touches is the caller's business. So
`wc report.txt` reads and `tee report.txt` writes, and nobody types a mode.

**A manifest is as much about refusal as need.** `date`'s row is `Forbidden` throughout, so a memory
grant aimed at a clock reader stops at the prompt.

## Removing a program

Delete its source file and its `[[bin]]` block. It leaves all three archives at once.

If the shell could spawn it, also delete its `programs!` row. The compiler then points at its
`manifest()` arm and any `write_outcome` arm that named it; delete those, and its
`SHELL_CHECK_SCRIPT` lines, which nothing on the host flags (see `BUGS`) and which
`script/shell-check` answers with `no such program`. **Leave its id unused.** The table's holes are expected: `PROG_COUNT` is
one past the highest id, not the number of programs.

**What catches a removal you did not mean to make**: `xtask`'s host test
`every_program_the_tree_loads_by_name_is_declared` fails when the kernel or the progenitor still
looks the program up by a string literal (`program("name")`, `.read("name")`), naming the file that
does. Before milestone 150 such a test would `skip!()` with "no such program in this archive" and
nobody would hear about it.

## Check your work

```sh
script/lint          # the name block, the conventions, and every host test named above
script/shell-check   # if the shell spawns it: both ISAs, and much faster than the suite
script/test          # all three architectures
```

`cargo xtask build` packs the aarch64 archive only, whatever the name suggests; `initrd_riscv()` and
`initrd_x86()` are called by `test` and `shell-check`. That no longer hides a packing mistake,
because all three archives pack one list, but it is still not a check of the other two builds.

**Run shell-check once with a deliberately wrong expectation.** A green harness only proves the
harness did not complain; a red one proves your program was really loaded from the archive,
measured, granted its endpoint and run at EL0. Verbatim from a run of this page on 2026-08-18:

```
$ triple 21
  a process at EL0 computed 21*3 = 63
--- shell-check (aarch64) FAILED ---
  `triple 21` answered "a process at EL0 computed 21*3 = 63", wanted "21*3 = 64"
```

## Why it works this way

Milestone 150, 2026-09-19. The block is
[design/roadmap/150-program-declaration-data.md](../design/roadmap/150-program-declaration-data.md);
this section is the reasoning, and
[DECISIONS §158](../design/decisions/158-a-program-is-declared-once.md) is the record minted from it.

**The archive list is the `[[bin]]` blocks.** A program has to be declared there for cargo to build
it, so that was always one of the places; the choice was whether the others could be derived from
it. Considered and refused:

- *A shared crate holding a `const` table of programs*, which both `xtask` and the kernel could
  read. It is still a second list beside `Cargo.toml`, only gated rather than hand-copied, so adding
  a program stays two edits. It would earn its place if the kernel needed the list at runtime, and
  it does not: everything that loads a program looks it up by name.
- *`cargo metadata` instead of reading `Cargo.toml`.* Correct by construction, but its output is
  JSON and `xtask` has no JSON parser. Hand-scanning JSON is no less fragile than hand-scanning the
  four keys this tree writes in a `[[bin]]` block, and DECISIONS §46 rules out a `serde_json` or
  `toml` dependency for one list. The scanner refuses what it does not understand instead.
- *Keeping per-architecture tables and gating them against each other.* The two tables disagreed
  about two programs when they were deleted, and neither difference was a decision: the shared
  table's own comment said not to filter by architecture, because an archive entry costs a slot and
  some bytes, nothing spawns a program by accident, and a test that cannot run somewhere `skip!()`s
  with the reason. Packing everything everywhere is that rule without a second place to break it.

**The shell's program table is one `macro_rules!` declaration.** The seven-edit `Prog` bookkeeping
had exactly one edit nothing caught (`PROG_COUNT`), and forgetting it also disarmed the test that
would have caught two more. Considered and refused:

- *A derive crate that counts variants* (`strum` and the like). DECISIONS §46: a proc-macro
  dependency in a crate the kernel and the progenitor link, for one count, is the dependency that
  section exists to refuse.
- *A `const` table of `(Prog, id, name)` beside a hand-written enum.* Still two lists: nothing
  stops a variant existing without a row, which is the original bug moved one line down.
- *Putting `manifest()` inside the declaration too*, for one edit instead of two. It would have
  worked, and it was refused because the manifest arms are the most commented code in the crate and
  `rustfmt` does not format inside a macro invocation. The compiler already demands the arm, so
  moving it buys one fewer edit that was never silent.
- *Deriving the id from declaration order.* Removing a program would renumber every later one,
  which is a wire-format change dressed as a deletion. Ids are written, `PROG_COUNT` is one past the
  highest, and removal leaves a hole.

**The count gate became a set of checks rather than a number.** The block asked for "a gate on
program count". A pinned total was considered and refused: it would be a hand-maintained number
that fails on every legitimate addition, which is the shape this milestone removes. What a count was
for is covered by construction (the archives and `PROG_COUNT` are derived, so neither can be short
of the declaration) and by three host tests on the relationships that can still go wrong: a
spawnable program with no binary, a program the tree loads by name with no binary, and a spawnable
program no shell-check line runs.

**`swish`'s exhaustive `write_outcome` match became a wildcard.** Eleven of its thirteen arms were
`=> {}`, so the compile error it raised for every new program asked a byte-stream author for a
keystroke, not a decision. `every_program_that_answers_in_words_renders_its_answer` now asks the
question it was standing in for, of exactly the programs it applies to. That is rung two in place of
rung one, deliberately, and it is the one place this milestone went down the ladder.

## BUGS

- **The `[[bin]]` reader knows four keys** (`name`, `path`, `test`, `bench`), because those are all
  this tree writes. Anything else in a `[[bin]]` block stops every pack with the key named. That is
  the intended failure, not an accident, but it means the first program to want
  `required-features` has to teach `bin_names` in `xtask` what the key means for the archives.
- **The removal gate is textual.** `every_program_the_tree_loads_by_name_is_declared` reads
  `program("...")` and `.read("...")` literals in `kernel/src` and
  `crates/system_initializer/src`. A name built at runtime, or looked up through some other
  spelling, is invisible to it, and a kernel test that `skip!()`s on a missing program still skips
  quietly for such a name. It counts what it matched and fails below fifty, so it cannot go blind
  without saying so.
- **Nothing on the host checks `SHELL_CHECK_SCRIPT` in the other direction.** A line typing a
  program that no longer exists is found by `script/shell-check`, at the cost of a boot. And the
  forward check is a whole-word match on the program's name, which proves a line mentions it, not
  that the line ran it.
- **The wire-id pin covers the thirteen ids shipped before 2026-09-19.** A program added after that
  and later removed leaves an id that only the duplicate check protects, and only while nothing else
  claims it. The declaration's written id makes a renumbering visible in review; reuse of a
  post-pin id is not gated. Appending a row to `the_wire_ids_already_shipped_never_move` is how to
  pin a later one.
- **Every archive packs every program, including ones that cannot run there**, which is the rule
  rather than an oversight (see "Why it works this way"). On 2026-09-19 that added `serial_driver`,
  `jh7110_entropy` and `pmap` to the aarch64 archive and `pmap` to the other two. `pmap` is packed
  and spawned by nothing (see `crates/pmap`'s `BUGS`); it costs a directory slot, which is what the
  rule prices it at.
- **Whether a program may take an argument and an input together is open**, and it is calef's call:
  [a-program-that-takes-an-argument-and-an-input.md](../design/roadmap/498-a-program-that-takes-an-argument-and-an-input.md).
  The tree allows it and nothing uses it. The `crates/swish` sweep that used to go red on it (the
  "eighth edit site" milestone 117's fifth stranger found) now types every operand a manifest asks
  for, so the combination needs no edit outside its own declaration.
- **This page is prose and the code can move without it.** The step that rots first is the manifest
  field list, which is why it is not repeated here: [program-manifest.md](program-manifest.md) has it,
  and the struct in `crates/grant_plan/src/lib.rs` is the authority over both.
- **Written from having done it, and wrong most times it was walked.** Every walk before milestone
  150 found the page wrong, and the reason was structural rather than careless: the fact it described
  lived in seven hand-maintained places it did not control, so it went stale inside two days, twice.

  | walk | program | wrong in |
  |---|---|---|
  | 2026-08-16 (run 2) | `doubler` | the aarch64 tier, the riscv `--bin` list, two of the six `grant_plan` edits, the `provisional` spelling the gate rejects |
  | 2026-08-18 (run 3) | `triangle` | the aarch64 tier again (milestone 130 had deleted both shapes it described), and `manifest()` missing from the `grant_plan` list |
  | 2026-08-18 (a lane) | a scratch binary, added and removed | `cargo xtask build` claimed to pack both archives and packs one, the `SHELL_CHECK_SCRIPT` example did not compile, and nothing said which of the seven `grant_plan` edits the machine catches |
  | 2026-08-18 (run 4) | `tally`, added and removed | **nothing.** The first walk of four to find no defect |
  | 2026-08-18 (run 5) | `nth`, kept | an **eighth** edit site: a manifest that requires an argument *and* an input failed a `crates/swish` sweep the walker had no reason to open |
  | 2026-09-19 (milestone 150) | `triple`, added and removed | **the count, measured on the new tree.** A plain program was three hand edits and is one. A spawnable program that answers in a register was twelve edits across five files, two of them silent, and is six across four (the `[[bin]]` block, the `programs!` row, then the `manifest()` arm, the `write_outcome` arm, the `SHELL_CHECK_SCRIPT` line and its array length, each demanded by the compiler or a host test). It packed into all three archives with no further edit and answered at both prompts. Removal left a byte-identical tree; the stale `SHELL_CHECK_SCRIPT` line was the one edit nothing on the host named |

  **One walk-through is not a guarantee**, and the next person to add a program should treat a
  surprise here as this page's bug rather than their own.

  **This table is also a leak, and it is worth knowing about before adding to it.** Milestone
  117's fourth stranger read these rows within half an hour and knew from them that it was at
  least the fourth person walking this page under measurement, which changed how it wrote. The
  rows stay, because deleting them would fabricate a tree and because the page's value is that
  it says how often it has been wrong. See notes/stranger-test.md's `BUGS`.
