# Adding a user program

Task-oriented, because milestone 117's first stranger run found that **no file described this**. It
reconstructed the steps from `xtask`, `user/Cargo.toml` and `grant_plan`, said it expected to have
got one wrong, and was right to expect that: the two initrd lists are easy to half-do.

A program is a `[[bin]]` in `user/`, running at EL0, linked against `user_rt`.

## The steps

### 1. The source

`user/src/<name>.rs`, `snake_case` (DECISIONS §39, and the convention table in
[naming.md](naming.md)). `no_std`, against `user_rt`.

### 2. A provenance block in its module doc

```rust
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-08-14 for <what it does>.
```

**`script/lint` fails without one**, via `script/names --check`. Three states: `ratified` (calef
ruled, with the date and what was refused), `recorded` (the tree argues the name somewhere, with a
citation), `unrecorded` (nothing outside this block says why). **The gate checks presence, never
`ratified`**, so an unratified name never blocks a build and `unrecorded` is a truthful answer.

**The name is calef's** (AGENTS.md, "calef names the crates, the programs, and the shared modules").
Ship a provisional one, say so in your report, expect it to change.

**Write `provisional` when you expect the name to change**, which is AGENTS.md's word and, since
§89 (2026-08-16), the gate's too. Four states:

```
Name: ratified 2026-08-04 (calef, milestone 63). Refused `x` (why).
Name: recorded (milestone 46). <what the tree already argues, and where>
Name: provisional. <what you called it and why you expect it to change>
Name: unrecorded. <what the history does and does not say>
```

`provisional` is a claim about **intent** (you expect this to change); the other three are claims
about the **record**. A settled name can be `unrecorded` (nobody wrote down why `hello` is called
`hello`, and nobody needs to), so the two are not the same word for the same thing.

`script/names --provisional` lists them and they sort first in `--unratified`, because a name its
own author called wrong is the shortest conversation calef can have. This page told newcomers the
opposite until §89: run 2 of the stranger test wrote the word AGENTS.md asked for and got a red
gate, which is what raised the decision.

### 3. A `[[bin]]` block in `user/Cargo.toml`

```toml
[[bin]]
name = "your_program"
path = "src/your_program.rs"
test = false
bench = false
```

`test` and `bench` off are **mandatory**, not tidiness: the default libtest harness needs
`extern crate test`, which does not exist for a bare-metal target.

### 4. Pack it into all three initrds, in `xtask/src/main.rs`

**Two hand-maintained lists as of 2026-08-27** (this page's fourth correction to this section; see
`BUGS`), down from three. All three architectures now build the whole `user` package unfiltered, so
there is no per-program `--bin` list on any of them any more:

- `initrd_aarch64()` (renamed from `mkinitrd()`, 2026-08-27) for aarch64: **one
  `("your_program", "your_program")` row in its `entries` table.** The pair is `(archive_name,
  bin_name)` and they differ exactly once in the whole table, for `init`.
- `initrd_riscv()` for riscv64: the same shape, one `("your_program", "your_program")` row in its
  own `entries` table (from [`portable_archive_entries`], shared with `initrd_x86()`). **It used to
  also need a `"--bin", "your_program",` pair in a hand-maintained `cargo build` argument list**,
  and that was the trap this section warned about through 2026-08-27: the table read an ELF that
  only the `--bin` list caused cargo to build, so half the edit failed the build with `mkinitrd:
  cannot read .../your_program: No such file or directory` (or, after the rename, the same failure
  under `initrd-riscv:`). That list predated riscv64 parity and every program in `user/` compiling
  for the riscv64 target; it bought nothing once that was true, and it fell out of step twice in one
  night (`audit_sink`, milestone 49) before it was deleted. **The trap described in the paragraph
  below is gone**, not just documented differently.
- `initrd_x86()` for x86_64: the same shared `entries` table, no `--bin` list, and never had one.

That old trap is not hypothetical, and the file carried its own scar about it before the fix: the
credential pair (milestone 56) sat in the riscv tables while nobody added them to the `--bin` list,
so a clean tree could not build them, and a lane's own riscv leg went green on a stale binary its
target directory still held. The mechanism that let that happen twice more (`audit_sink`) is exactly
what motivated deleting the list rather than remembering it harder.

**What changed, and why this page was wrong about this function three times running.** It used to
send you to a `for name in [ ... ]` list and warn you off an older tier of hand-written
`let name = match read_stripped(...)` blocks; milestone 130 deleted both on 2026-08-17, replacing
them with the one table and one loop `initrd_riscv()`'s packaging step had always had. That left the
`--bin` list as the one remaining asymmetry, which run 2 corrected this page to describe on
2026-08-16 and which 130 then re-broke the next day (see `BUGS`, because the recurrence is the
finding rather than the accident); the `--bin` list itself is now gone (2026-08-27), which is the
first time this section has shrunk instead of just moved.

**You do not touch the measurement table.** init refuses to spawn a program its measurement manifest
does not vouch for, and a reader who meets that refusal reasonably wonders where to register a new
one. Nowhere: `xtask` hashes every entry of the archive it just packed and writes the manifest from
that (`write_measure_manifest`), so the table follows the archive by construction.

### 5. Keep the name under 32 bytes

`nifefs` caps `NAME_LEN` at 32, raised from 24 so `os_primitives_benchmarker` would fit. Raising
it again costs directory entries per block, so do not let a name spend it.

### 6. If the shell should be able to spawn it: a `Prog` variant

In `crates/grant_plan/src/lib.rs`, **seven edits**, not the six this page listed until 2026-08-18
and not the four before that:

**In this order**, which is not the order they appear in the file. The first four are the ones
nothing forces, and doing them first is what makes the last three fall out of a failing build:

1. the `Prog` variant itself;
2. **`PROG_COUNT`**, widened, and the table below says why this one goes second rather than last;
3. `from_id()`;
4. `from_name()`, which is how the shell resolves what you type. Without it the program is in the
   archive, loadable, and unreachable from the prompt, which looks like the program being broken
   rather than unlisted;
5. `name()`;
6. `id()`, the **stable wire id**;
7. **`manifest()`**, which carries all of the actual meaning: what the shell must grant your program
   and what it must refuse it. See "What you declare" below.

**The wire id is the expensive part.** It is a thing two programs agree on, which CLAUDE.md classes
as hard to reverse: the shell sends it and init decodes it, so changing one later is a flag day. The
code around it is cheap; the number is not.

**Then expect the build to fail in a crate you did not edit**, and expect that to be the design
working:

```
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `Prog::Triple` not covered
   --> crates/swish/src/lib.rs:864:11
```

The shell must say how your program's answer renders, so the compiler asks. Add the arm.

#### Which of the seven the machine will remind you about, and which it will not

**Measured on 2026-08-18 by adding a variant and building after each edit**, because a list that
tells you what to do says nothing about what happens if you do not.

| edit | what happens if you skip it |
|---|---|
| `name()`, `id()`, `manifest()` | **compile error**, all three at once, `E0004` in `grant_plan` itself |
| the `swish` render arm | **compile error**, `E0004` in a crate you did not edit |
| `from_id()` | a host test fails, `init indexes slot N and no program claims it`, **but only if `PROG_COUNT` moved** |
| `from_name()` | a host test fails, `left: None, right: Some(YourProg)`, **same condition** |
| `PROG_COUNT` | **nothing at all** |

**`PROG_COUNT` is the keystone, and forgetting it hides the other two.** The sweep in
`prog_id_round_trips` counts up to that constant, so a variant whose id is past it is a variant the
sweep never reaches, and the guard beside it (`from_id(PROG_COUNT)` answers `None`) passes *because*
you forgot. A tree with the variant, the three forced arms, the `swish` arm and nothing else
**compiles and passes every host test**, and the failure arrives later as a program that cannot be
spawned from the prompt. Widen `PROG_COUNT` and the same test immediately names both missing arms,
one after the other.

That is why the list above is ordered the way it is: widen `PROG_COUNT` early and
`cargo test -p grant_plan` tells you what is still missing. Widen it last and there is nothing left
to tell you.

## What you declare: the manifest

The manifest is the program's endowment, and the shell checks it **at the prompt, before a child
exists**. A mismatch is a legible refusal on the line you typed rather than a hang deep inside a
program that assumed a slot was full. See [grant-expression.md](grant-expression.md) and
[program-manifest.md](program-manifest.md).

**The manifest declares the direction; the command line designates the file.** Whether a program
writes is a fixed, publishable property of it. Which file it touches is the caller's business. So
`wc report.txt` reads and `tee report.txt` writes, and nobody types a mode.

**A manifest is as much about refusal as need.** `date`'s row is `Forbidden` throughout, so a memory
grant aimed at a clock reader stops at the prompt.

## Check your work

```sh
cargo xtask build    # the aarch64 archive ONLY, which is the trap below
script/lint          # the name block, the conventions, the host pass
script/test          # both ISAs, and it builds the riscv archive
script/shell-check   # if the shell spawns it: also both ISAs, and much faster than the suite
```

**`cargo xtask build` does not pack all three archives**, whatever the name suggests, and this page
claimed it did until 2026-08-18. It runs `initrd_aarch64()` (`mkinitrd()` before 2026-08-27) and
stops; `initrd_riscv()` and `initrd_x86()` are called by `test()` and by `shell-check` and by
nothing else, so after a green `cargo xtask build` the files `target/initrd-riscv.img` and
`target/initrd-x86_64.img` may not exist at all. **A step-4 mistake on the riscv or x86 packaging
table is invisible to it.** If the shell spawns your program, `script/shell-check` is the cheapest
thing that catches one on aarch64/riscv64: it builds both archives and boots both prompts, and it
does not run the kernel suite.

If the shell spawns it, add a line to `SHELL_CHECK_SCRIPT` in `xtask/src/main.rs` and bump the array
length the compiler asks for. The element is a `(&str, &[&str])` pair, one line typed and the
substrings its answer must contain: `("triple 21", &["21*3 = 63"]),`.

**Then run it once with a deliberately wrong expectation.** A green harness only proves the harness
did not complain; a red one proves your program was really loaded from the archive, measured,
granted its endpoint and run at EL0. Verbatim from a run of this page on 2026-08-18:

```
$ triple 21
  a process at EL0 computed 21*3 = 63
--- shell-check (aarch64) FAILED ---
  `triple 21` answered "a process at EL0 computed 21*3 = 63", wanted "21*3 = 64"
```

## BUGS

- **Nothing gates the three initrd packaging tables against each other.** A program in
  `initrd_aarch64()`'s `entries` table and not in `initrd_riscv()`'s (or `initrd_x86()`'s, both of
  which share [`portable_archive_entries`]) builds, boots on aarch64, and is simply absent
  elsewhere. The parity gate catches it only if a test names the program. **This used to also be
  true of a hand-maintained `--bin` build list on riscv64** (fixed 2026-08-27: that list is gone,
  and the riscv64/x86_64 build step is now unfiltered like aarch64's always was), so what remains
  is narrower than it was, but the packaging-table gap is unchanged.
  **The two commands you will run first are both blind to it**, which run 4 measured: such a program
  passes `cargo xtask build` *and* `script/lint`, and is caught first by `script/shell-check` or
  `script/test`, both of which cost an emulated boot. **And nothing counts programs**, so the
  suite total is identical with and without one: 1312 tests before `tally` and 1312 after. A
  program's presence is proven only by a transcript line somebody remembered to write into
  `SHELL_CHECK_SCRIPT`.
- **The archives do not boot the same binary, and the sentence saying so is 200 lines from where
  you need it.** `initrd_aarch64()` packs `hello` under the archive name `init`; `initrd_riscv()`
  and `initrd_x86()` pack `builder`. `xtask/src/main.rs` does state this, in a comment on the
  aarch64 table's `hello` row rather than on either `("init", ...)` row, and run 4's stranger read
  both tables in the same minute and still reported the asymmetry as undocumented. For a project
  whose loudest claim is architectural parity that is worth meeting at the table you are editing.
- **Removal is the same eight places and has no page.** Taking a program out is clean only while
  you can still name every file you touched; a half-removed program is a `PROG_COUNT` too large
  and an init table slot no variant claims, which is the same silent failure as a forgotten
  `PROG_COUNT`, reached from the other side. There is no `removing-a-program.md` and this page is
  about adding. Run 4 reverted `tally` to a byte-identical tree and noted that it worked first
  time only because the eight edits were still in its head.
- **This page is prose and the code can move without it.** The step that rots first is the manifest
  field list, which is why it is not repeated here: [program-manifest.md](program-manifest.md) has it,
  and the struct in `crates/grant_plan/src/lib.rs` is the authority over both.
- **Written from having done it, three times, most recently on 2026-08-18.** It began as a
  second-hand account of a first-hand guess: reconstructed after milestone 117's first stranger
  reconstructed it, and its own BUGS section asked the first person to add a program against it to
  correct whatever it got wrong. Every walk since has been that, and each one found the page wrong:

  | walk | program | wrong in |
  |---|---|---|
  | 2026-08-16 (run 2) | `doubler` | the aarch64 tier, the riscv `--bin` list, two of the six `grant_plan` edits, the `provisional` spelling the gate rejects |
  | 2026-08-18 (run 3) | `triangle` | the aarch64 tier again (milestone 130 had deleted both shapes it described), and `manifest()` missing from the `grant_plan` list |
  | 2026-08-18 (this lane) | a scratch binary, added and removed | `cargo xtask build` claimed to pack both archives and packs one, the `SHELL_CHECK_SCRIPT` example did not compile, and nothing said which of the seven `grant_plan` edits the machine catches |
  | 2026-08-18 (run 4) | `tally`, added and removed | **nothing.** The first walk of four to find no defect, including `crates/swish/src/lib.rs:864`, which the page quotes by line number and which still is that line |
  | 2026-08-18 (run 5) | `nth`, kept | an **eighth** edit site the list of seven does not have: a manifest that requires an argument *and* an input fails `the_arg_line_follows_the_manifest_for_every_program` in `crates/swish/src/lib.rs`, in a crate the walker did not edit |

  Run 3 recorded its two rather than fixing them, deliberately and per its own convention: a run
  that stops to fix things stops measuring, and its findings stop being traceable to it (see
  notes/stranger-test.md). The lane below it did the fixing.

  **One walk-through is not a guarantee and four are not either**, and the next person to add a
  program should treat a surprise here as this page's bug rather than their own.

  **This table is also a leak, and it is worth knowing about before adding to it.** Milestone
  117's fourth stranger read these rows within half an hour and knew from them that it was at
  least the fourth person walking this page under measurement, which changed how it wrote. The
  rows stay, because deleting them would fabricate a tree and because the page's value is that
  it says how often it has been wrong. See notes/stranger-test.md's `BUGS`.
- **This page went stale inside two days, twice, which is the finding rather than the accident.** Run
  2 corrected it on 2026-08-16; milestone 130 falsified step 4 on 2026-08-17; run 3 found it wrong on
  2026-08-18. The fact it describes lives in seven hand-maintained places and this page is an eighth.
  By the ladder in AGENTS.md that is a rung-four answer to a rung-one problem, and rewriting the
  prose a fourth time will not change it. The tracked home for the mechanism is milestone 150
  ("Adding a program should not need eight hand-maintained lists," minted provisionally 2026-08-22 by
  milestone 117's handoffs lane, nominated by three successive strangers): a `Prog` variant could
  carry its archive name and its manifest as data, and both initrd tables could be generated from it.
- **There is an eighth edit site and it depends on your manifest, so the count above is a lower
  bound.** Found 2026-08-18 by milestone 117's fifth stranger, which deliberately picked the one
  manifest combination nothing in the tree had used: a **required argument together with a required
  input**. `the_arg_line_follows_the_manifest_for_every_program` in `crates/swish/src/lib.rs` sweeps
  `Prog` and asks each program's manifest whether it takes an argument, which is the generalisation
  its own doc comment argues for at length. Then it builds the line `"<name> 21"` against
  `Holdings::default()` and hard-codes everything else, so the planner refuses it for any program
  that also requires an input, and the sweep goes red on a program whose only sin is a manifest
  shape nothing had used yet. **A test written to survive the next program added does not survive
  this one**, and it is in a crate the person adding the program has no reason to open. The
  stranger repaired it in its own disposable clone and the tree is unchanged: on `main` an
  argument-plus-input program cannot be added without `crates/swish`'s sweep going red, because
  that sweep types a single-operand line and never supplies the input operand such a program would
  also need.

  **Corrected 2026-08-22, milestone 117's second handoffs lane, by testing the claim rather than
  reading it: the combination is headroom, not a refusal.** `plan_against_with` did carry a
  comment ruling out file-plus-input on positional-arity grounds and saying nothing about
  argument-plus-input, which read as though the second case might be the same kind of closed door
  as the first. It is not, and the two are not analogous: `FileSpec` and `InputSpec` both grant a
  bare name, so a manifest declaring both would leave the parser with two indistinguishable
  positions and nothing but order to sort them, which is the real thing `ArgSpec`'s widening is
  for. `ArgSpec` and `InputSpec` do not share that problem, because `arg` is numeric-shaped and
  claims a fixed earlier position before `input`'s bare-name fallback ever looks at what remains,
  exactly the way `arg` and `file` already compose. A host test in `crates/grant_plan/src/lib.rs`
  (`an_argument_and_an_input_stream_compose_by_the_same_fixed_order`) plans `nth 21 report.txt`
  against a manifest declaring both and gets a clean grant back with no widening built. The comment
  at `plan_against_with`'s input operand now says this in place, so the next reader meets the
  distinction where the code is rather than only here. What is still genuinely undecided is
  whether the combination is *wanted*: no shipped program needs it, and adding one that does will
  still need `the_arg_line_follows_the_manifest_for_every_program` in `crates/swish/src/lib.rs`
  taught to supply an input operand for a program whose manifest asks for one, since that sweep's
  gap is what turns red today, not the planner.
- **The program's name is written in six places as of 2026-08-27** (seven before that date; see
  below) and nothing joins them: the `[[bin]]` block in `user/Cargo.toml`, `initrd_aarch64()`'s
  table, `initrd_riscv()`'s table, `initrd_x86()`'s table (the last two share
  [`portable_archive_entries`]), the seven-part `Prog` table in `grant_plan`, the exhaustive match
  in `swish`, and `SHELL_CHECK_SCRIPT`. This page is a seventh. Steps 4 and 6 are long because the
  tree is, not because adding a program is hard. **`initrd_riscv()`'s own hand-maintained `--bin`
  build list was the seventh site through 2026-08-26**; it is deleted as of 2026-08-27 (this lane),
  the first of these lists to be removed rather than merely documented, so the count here dropped
  for the first time instead of only moving. **Two of the remaining six can be skipped in
  silence**: a missing `initrd_riscv()`/`initrd_x86()` table row, and `from_id()` and `from_name()`
  when `PROG_COUNT` was forgotten alongside them. Step 6's table is measured rather than reasoned,
  and a claim about which of these the compiler catches is worth re-measuring rather than quoting:
  the last such claim written down in this tree was wrong, and it was written in the test that
  makes it.
