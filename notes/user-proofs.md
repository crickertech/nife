# Proving things about `user/`

Milestone 197. The companion to [kernel-proofs.md](kernel-proofs.md), which did the same thing one
privilege level down; both are downstream of [verification.md](verification.md), which is about
proving the pure crates. This one is about the 68 EL0 programs the prover could not compile until
2026-08-31, about the stubs you take on when you point it at them, and about the two shapes of
property that turned out to be out of reach.

*Name provisional: notes are an interface and their names are calef's call (AGENTS.md).
`user-proofs` says what the file is about and matches `kernel-proofs.md`'s neighbourhood; expect it
to change.*

## Why this note exists

`script/verify`'s header has always been honest that `cargo kani -p <crate>` never compiles the
kernel, the user programs, or xtask. Milestone 193 removed the first. Milestone 197's block argued
that **`user/` had at least as good a claim on the prover as the kernel did**, because it holds real
parsers over bytes this system did not produce.

That premise is half right, and the half that is wrong is worth stating first, because it is a
finding rather than a disappointment.

**Most of the parsing is not in `user/` any more.** Rule 7 (anything two binaries agree on is a
crate) and the host-testability discipline have already lifted it out: the initrd parser is
`nifefs`, the ELF front half is `elf`, the partition table is `gpt`, the mDNS decoder is
`mdns_proto`, the directory entries are `filesystem_proto`, the terminal escapes are
`video_terminal`, the shell's routing is `swish`, the pattern matcher is `glob`. Every one of those
is in `script/verify`'s table already. What is left in `user/src/*.rs` is overwhelmingly **IO glue**:
programs that call a crate to decode, call `user_rt` to move the result, and render. That is the
tree working as designed, and it means the prize this milestone was reaching for had largely been
collected by other milestones under other names.

What is left is still worth proving, and one attempt at proving it found a live defect.

## The defect this found, which is the point

`user/src/rmle.rs` (the editor) holds a document as `MAX_ROWS` rows of at most `MAX_COLS` bytes, and
saves it by joining the rows with `\n` into one scratch buffer before writing that buffer to the
filesystem. The buffer was `MAX_ROWS * MAX_COLS`.

**That is the size of the document's text, not the size of what `save` writes.** The separators cost
`MAX_ROWS - 1` bytes more. A document at both bounds (32 rows of 100 columns, which the editor's own
limits permit and which typing 31 characters onto the last line of a freshly loaded full file
reaches) staged 3231 bytes into a 3200-byte buffer and panicked the editor on `^S`.

Nothing found this in the eight months `rmle` has existed. It was found by **trying to state the
property**, before any harness ran, which is the mechanism milestone 191 said the tree was missing:
a property has to be written down before it can be checked, and writing it down is where the two
constants got compared for the first time.

The fix is the buffer sized as `MAX_ROWS * (MAX_COLS + 1)`, one separator budgeted per row rather
than per gap, and **a `const` assertion beside it** rather than a proof:

```rust
const _: () = assert!(FILE_SCRATCH_LEN >= MAX_ROWS * MAX_COLS + (MAX_ROWS - 1));
```

That is rung one of AGENTS.md's ladder, and it is the right rung: the claim is a relationship
between three compile-time constants, so the compiler can hold it for nothing and will stop the
build at the line that is wrong. The next section is why it is not *also* a harness.

## What Kani could not do here, measured

**A proof that does not terminate is not a weaker proof, it is no proof**, and three properties were
written, run, and abandoned before the one that shipped. They are recorded because the shapes
generalise, and because a future lane that tries the obvious thing deserves the measurement rather
than the surprise.

| the property | the shape | what happened |
|---|---|---|
| the staged document fits the buffer | a bound on a **sum of 32 symbolic values** | no answer in 20 minutes, on CaDiCaL **or** Z3 |
| `Editor::insert_char` preserves the document invariant | a **symbolic index into a 3.5 KB struct** | CBMC ran out of memory in 3m23s |
| `wc::render` writes the digits of `v` | any claim about **values off a chain of 20 divisions** | no answer in 10 minutes |

The first is the instructive one. "The sum of at most 32 values, each at most 100, is at most 3232"
is arithmetic a child can check, and it is a **cardinality argument**, which is the family
resolution-based SAT is famously worst at; the solver has to rediscover counting from bit-level
adders. Kani is a bounded model checker over a SAT backend, and this is not a gap in the tool so
much as the wrong question to bring it.

The second says the same thing about state size rather than arithmetic: a symbolic index into an
array of 32 hundred-byte rows is a case split the formula cannot afford, so the editor's editing
operations are out of reach as written. Restructuring the document so its lengths live apart from
its bytes would fix that, and would be a data-layout change made for the prover, which is a design
question and not a lane's to take.

The third is the trap most likely to catch the next person: `render` verifies **instantly** if the
only assertion is `n <= out.len()`, because `--slice-formula` throws the division chain away as
irrelevant. Add one assertion about a byte's *value* and the whole chain becomes relevant and the
harness stops finishing. A fast harness is not evidence that the code is cheap to reason about; it
can be evidence that the assertion was not asking anything.

**What Kani is good at here, and what shipped, is the opposite shape**: bounded byte movement with
comparisons, no sums, no division, no symbolic indices into large objects.

## What is proved today

Two harnesses, both in `user/src/printenv.rs`, both about `push`, which appends what fits of a byte
string into a fixed 96-byte line buffer and drops the rest.

`printenv` prints `TZ`, `LANG` and `TERM` out of a configuration page `system_initializer` filled,
so two of the three arguments to `push` are **bytes this program did not write**, and the running
offset across three calls is a function of them. The one thing standing between that page and a
write past the end of a fixed array is a single `*n < buf.len()`.

- **`push_never_writes_past_the_buffer_it_was_given`.** For every starting offset in the whole of
  `usize` and every content, `push` writes nothing outside `buf`; and given an offset that starts in
  range it ends in range, appends (nothing below the starting offset moves) and reports what it
  wrote (nothing at or above the final offset moves). The starting offset is left unconstrained on
  purpose: memory safety must not depend on the caller, and here it does not, because the guard is a
  comparison rather than a subtraction.
- **`the_buffer_can_be_filled_exactly`.** A `kani::cover!` that the boundary is actually reached, so
  the assertion above is not being proved by an assumption set that never gets near it. DECISIONS
  §134 notes the tree had 23 `cover` sites against 141 harnesses; a bound nothing approaches is how a
  proof becomes decoration.

**Cost: 2.4 seconds**, against `script/verify`'s ~650. Both were **falsified before they were
believed** (`user/falsifications/`, and the section below on why no script replays it).

**The unwind bound is `bytes.len() == 4`, and it is stated at the harness.** The loop body is one
comparison and one store per byte and the starting offset is symbolic over all of `usize`, so four
bytes already exercise every way a push can meet the boundary: entirely below, crossing, exactly on,
entirely past. What it cannot see is a defect that appears only at a larger length, and none is
expressible in a loop whose whole state is a `usize` that only increments.

## What it took, exactly

Shorter than milestone 193's list, because the kernel had already paid for most of it.

| what stopped it | why | the fix |
|---|---|---|
| `unwinding panics are not supported without std` | the workspace deliberately does not set `panic = "abort"` (DECISIONS §7) | nothing: Kani passes `-C panic=abort` itself, so this is a `cargo check` problem and not a `cargo kani` one |
| `found duplicate lang item panic_impl` | Kani links `std`, which defines the handler `user_rt::panic_handler!()` expands to | `#[cfg(not(kani))]` on the macro invocation, in the one binary carrying a harness |
| `Failed to detect Kani functions ... seems to be using #[no_std]` | Kani refuses a `no_std` crate root that never mentions it, and 67 of the 68 programs never will | select the binaries instead: `--bin`, derived in `script/verify` from a grep of the tree |

**No `--ignore-global-asm`**, which is the difference from the kernel and is DECISIONS §4 rule 1
paying out again: there is no `global_asm!` anywhere under `user/`, because the only assembly a
program has any business containing is the syscall itself and that lives in `user_rt`.

The `--bin` selection is the one piece of machinery worth arguing about, and the argument is in
`script/verify`'s own comment: a hand-written list of binaries would be one name short the first
time somebody adds a harness to a 69th program, and that failure is the **invisible** one this
project has now recorded twice (`mdns_proto`, `jh7110_trng`) -- the suite goes green faster and
nothing says a harness stopped running. `script/lint` already catches a whole package missing from
the verify table; only the derivation catches a binary missing from inside one.

## The stub boundary, enumerated

**A proof with an unexamined stub is worse than no proof, because it reads as coverage.** This is the
exhaustive list of what a harness in `user/src` cannot see. The same list is at the top of each
`mod proofs`, where somebody writing the next harness will actually meet it.

1. **Every capability is unreachable, and the boundary is hard rather than soft.** `user_rt`'s
   `send`, `recv`, `call`, `invoke` and `exit` are `svc`/`ecall` through `asm!`, which Kani reports
   as an unsupported construct instead of proving past. So a harness that wanders into a program's
   IO **fails loudly** rather than reporting a proof about a fiction. This is the good direction and
   it is why the list below is short.
2. **`MappedWindow` is a raw pointer to nothing.** Every shared page (`CONFIG_VA`, `FS_VA`,
   `TERM_OUT_VA`, the DMA and ring windows) is a fixed virtual address a wiring maps before the
   program runs. Under a model checker nothing is mapped there. Do not write a harness that reads
   one; stub the boundary rather than pretend.
3. **The panic handler is absent** under `cfg(kani)`, so nothing proved here says anything about what
   a program does after a panic. Note the asymmetry with the kernel: an EL0 program dying is one
   process, and `user_rt::trap()` is what the supervisor sees.
4. **`script/lint`'s harness-clippy pass excludes `user`**, exactly as it excludes `kernel`, and for
   the same two tooling reasons that pass's own comment carries. Practical consequence: **keep these
   harnesses free of `unsafe`**, because `undocumented_unsafe_blocks` does not fire inside them.
5. **Only the binaries carrying harnesses are compiled at all.** `cargo kani -p user` is never run
   bare, so a construct that would stop Kani in some *other* program is not discovered until somebody
   adds a harness there. That is a cost of the `--bin` selection and is the honest half of the
   argument for it.
6. **The C component is not linked.** `user/build.rs` compiles `c/c_seam.c` into `c_shim` and
   `c/c_swappable.c` into `c_swappable`; on a host target it warns and emits nothing. Those two
   programs are not provable and `-Z c-ffi` is not enabled.

## Adding a harness to `user/src`

1. Put it beside the code it proves, in a `#[cfg(kani)] mod proofs`, not in a separate file. The
   stub list above is the reason: a reader has to meet the caveats where they meet the harness.
2. Put `#[cfg(not(kani))]` on that binary's `user_rt::panic_handler!()`, or it will not compile.
3. Check the call graph against the stub list. If it reaches `user_rt`, stop; Kani will say so
   rather than lie, but you will have spent the compile finding out.
4. **Check the shape before you write it.** Bounded byte movement, comparisons and small fixed
   arrays are cheap. A sum over many symbolic values, a symbolic index into a large struct, and any
   claim about values downstream of division are the three that did not finish; the table above has
   the numbers.
5. Falsify it. Break the code under it, watch the harness go red, and record the patch (DECISIONS
   §134). Then put the code back.
6. Nothing needs adding to `script/verify`: the `user` row is there and the `--bin` list is derived.
   If you add a harness to a package that is *not* in that table, `script/lint`'s "every crate with
   proof harnesses is in the verify table" check fails, which is the gate that exists because two
   crates spent months carrying harnesses nothing ran.

## Is `xtask` worth proving? No, and here is the argument

Milestone 197's block names `xtask` alongside `user/` and does not argue for it. Its own BUGS section
says so. This is the argument, and it is a refusal.

**The front door is already open, and that is not the question.** Measured 2026-08-31:
`cargo kani -p xtask --no-codegen` compiles with **no changes to anything** -- no `cfg`, no flag, no
`--bin`. It is ordinary host `std` code. So the cost of *starting* is zero and the case has to be
made on value.

Four reasons it is not worth it, in the order they matter:

1. **A defect in `xtask` cannot hurt anything that runs.** It builds images and drives QEMU on the
   developer's machine; it is never on the target, never handles an untrusted counterparty's bytes at
   runtime, and holds no capability. Its failure mode is a wrong gate result, not a compromised
   system. Every argument in DECISIONS §14 for a verified core is an argument about the core.
2. **Proving its parsers would destroy the thing that makes them worth having.** `xtask`'s
   hand-written decoders (the mDNS prober, the screendump readers) exist *precisely* to be a second
   opinion: `xtask/Cargo.toml`'s own comment says the wire-format side is deliberately **not** shared
   with `mdns_proto`, "or the gate would be checking `mdns_proto` against itself." Aiming the same
   prover at both halves of a deliberately independent pair narrows the independence that is their
   entire justification.
3. **It is the environment Kani is least differentiated in.** `xtask` is host code with `std`, a
   heap, `#[test]`s, `cargo test`, a debugger and a stack trace. Kani earns its keep where testing
   cannot go: no allocator, no scheduler, an input space nobody can enumerate. None of that is true
   here.
4. **The cost is not zero even though the front door is free.** It is 8,511 lines in one file whose
   logic is process orchestration -- `Command`, paths, environment variables, timeouts -- which is
   the category a model checker has to stub out entirely, and a suite of stubs is where a proof
   quietly becomes decoration. Its genuinely pure logic already lives in the crates it depends on
   (`nifefs`, `gpt`, `manual`, `measured_boot`, `compositor`, `video_terminal`, `bitmap_font`),
   and every one of those is in `script/verify`'s table today.

**What would change this answer**: `xtask` growing logic that decides something the target then
trusts. The measured-boot digest is the shape to watch, and it is already in `measured_boot`, which
is the right place for exactly this reason.

## EXAMPLES

Prove just the user programs' harnesses:

```console
$ cargo kani -p user --bin printenv --output-format=terse
...
Complete - 2 successfully verified harnesses, 0 failures, 2 total.
```

One harness on its own, with a counterexample trace on failure:

```console
$ cargo kani -p user --bin printenv \
      --harness push_never_writes_past_the_buffer_it_was_given
```

The whole suite, `user` included, the way CI runs it:

```console
$ script/verify
```

**Falsify a harness before you believe it.** Milestone 191 is why this is not optional: it measured
141 harnesses and found none that had caught a defect after the day it was written. No script
replays this one (see BUGS), so it is done by hand:

```console
$ git apply user/falsifications/proofs.push_never_writes_past_the_buffer_it_was_given.patch
$ cargo kani -p user --bin printenv --output-format=terse
Failed Checks: index out of bounds: the length is less than or equal to the given index
 File: "user/src/printenv.rs", line 126, in push
Complete - 0 successfully verified harnesses, 2 failures, 2 total.
$ git apply -R user/falsifications/proofs.push_never_writes_past_the_buffer_it_was_given.patch
```

Both go red on one relaxed comparison. That was run on 2026-08-31 and is the reason these harnesses
are worth their place rather than an assertion that they are.

## BUGS

- **`script/falsifications` walks `crates/` only, so this milestone's record is outside its census
  and its sweep**, and so are `kernel`'s two harnesses from milestone 193, which carry no
  `Falsification:` record at all. The count that script prints is therefore a ratio over `crates/`
  rather than over the tree, and it does not know it. Two things are needed and neither is one line:
  the walk has to be derived from `cargo metadata` the way `script/lint`'s verify-table check
  already is, and `--sweep` shells `cargo kani -p <crate>`, which for the `user` package selects 68
  binaries rather than one. Proposed as a milestone in this lane's report.
- **Two harnesses is not coverage of 68 programs**, and the number to watch is not the count but
  whether the properties are ones a defect would violate. This one is: the same guard, one character
  different, is the whole failure.
- **The three shapes in the table above are recorded, not solved.** In particular the editor's
  editing operations (`insert_char`, `insert_newline`, `backspace`, `delete_at_cursor`) are the
  richest untrusted-input surface left in `user/` and are out of reach as the document is laid out
  today.
- **`user/` is a package with 68 binaries and no library**, so there is no `cargo kani -p user` that
  means "everything". Stub 5 above is the consequence.
- **`user`'s 3 seconds in `script/verify`'s table is a dev-Mac number**, like `mdns_proto`'s,
  `jh7110_trng`'s and `kernel`'s, and the wrong machine for that column. Replace it from the first
  CI log that carries it. Almost all of it is compile rather than solver time, so it will grow with
  the harnesses and not with the programs.
- **This note does not price the rest of the work.** What was measured is which shapes open and
  which do not.
