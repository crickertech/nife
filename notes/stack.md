# The stack, `sp`, and `x30`

## What problem it solves

A function needs scratch space: somewhere for its local variables, and somewhere to park
`x30` when it calls something else.

You can't statically assign every function a fixed chunk of memory, for two reasons.
**Recursion** (one function can be in progress many times at once, each instance needing
its own locals) and **waste** (a program with 10,000 functions would reserve scratch space
for all of them when only a handful are ever active).

## The insight

**Function lifetimes are strictly nested.** If `foo` calls `bar`, `bar` always finishes
before `foo` does. There is no way for `foo` to return while `bar` is still running.

That's a strong property. It means scratch space can be allocated and freed in **strict
LIFO order**, which means you don't need a memory allocator at all. You need **a pointer
that moves down when you enter a function and up when you leave.**

That pointer is `sp`. The region it moves through is the stack. That's the whole idea;
everything else is bookkeeping.

## What it costs

Allocating 32 bytes of locals:

```asm
sub sp, sp, #32
```

One instruction. Freeing them: one instruction. No free list, no search, no fragmentation.

This is why stack allocation is effectively free and heap allocation isn't. `malloc` has
to *search* for a suitable hole, because heap objects don't have nested lifetimes and can
be freed in any order. The stack skips all of that by exploiting a structural fact about
how function calls work.

## `sp` is a register that holds an address

That's all it is. A 64-bit CPU register whose value is a memory address: the "stack
pointer."

And **the stack is not a data structure the CPU knows about. It's just a region of RAM.**
The only thing that makes it a stack is that everyone agrees to treat it like one: `sp`
points at the current top, and the region grows **downward** into lower addresses.

Which is why the [linker script](linker-scripts.md) has to reserve a chunk of memory and
export `__stack_top`. There is nothing magic to allocate. We are picking a stretch of RAM
and declaring "this is the stack now."

## Stack frames, and why backtraces exist

One function's slice of the stack (its locals, its saved registers, its parked `x30`) is
a **stack frame**. The stack is a pile of them, one per function currently in progress.

Each frame also saves `x29`, the **frame pointer**, which points at the previous frame. So
the frames form a linked list running back down the call chain, and each one has a saved
`x30` sitting right next to it.

**That linked list is a stack trace.** Printing a backtrace means walking `x29` from frame
to frame, reading the saved `x30` out of each, and mapping those addresses to function
names. There is no magic table. The information was already lying in memory because of how
calls work.

## Stack overflow (and a thing we have to deal with)

`sp` moves down and **nothing checks it**. Recurse too deeply and `sp` walks off the
bottom of the reserved region into whatever memory is below.

In a normal program the OS puts an unmapped **guard page** just past the end of the stack,
so touching it raises a page fault and you get a clean crash. That is what "stack
overflow" *is*: you hit the guard page.

**We didn't have that when this was written**, and the paragraph is kept in its original tense
because the incident below happened while it was true. We had 64 KiB reserved in a linker script and
nothing below it but more of our own kernel, so blowing the stack silently overwrote `.bss`, then
`.data`, then `.text`, and then executed the corrupted result.

**We have it now.** Milestone 4 put an unmapped page below the boot stack once the MMU was on;
milestone 90 finished the job, so today the boot stack, every per-CPU secondary stack and every
kernel thread stack has one. See "The overflows of 2026-08-14" at the end of this note for what that
buys, what it does not, and the two real overflows that tested it.

---

# The milestone 3 incident

The paragraph above was written during milestone 1 as a hypothetical. It happened during
milestone 3. Recording it in full, because how it was *diagnosed* is more useful than the
bug.

## The symptom

A kernel test hung. Forever. Under a 150-second timeout, it never finished. No panic, no
fault, no output. The last thing printed was the name of the test.

## The bug

```rust
let mut taken = [None; 1024];        // [Option<Frame>; 1024] = 16 KiB
...
for frame in taken.into_iter().flatten() {
    memory::free(frame);
}
```

`into_iter()` on an array **moves it by value**. `flatten()` wraps the result in another
struct, which gets moved again. In a debug build (no optimization, nothing elided) those
copies are all real, and they all land on the stack:

```
  16 KiB   taken
+ 16 KiB   the array moved into core::array::IntoIter
+ 16 KiB   the IntoIter moved into Flatten
--------
  48 KiB   on a 64 KiB stack that already had frames on it
```

`sp` walked below `__stack_bottom`, through `.bss`, through `.data`, and into `.text`. The
kernel then executed its own overwritten code, and hung.

**`into_iter()` on a large array is a real kernel footgun.** Use `iter()` and borrow.

## Three wrong turns, and what actually worked

**Wrong turn 1: "it printed `sp=` and stopped, so it dies inside `println!`."** It didn't.
That was QEMU's *unflushed stdout buffer* being discarded when the timeout killed it. The
output we saw was simply the last thing that made it out of the buffer, not the last thing
that executed. **Never infer a hang location from where output stops** unless you know the
output is unbuffered.

**Wrong turn 2: "the stack is fine."** A probe measured `headroom()` right after declaring
the array and found plenty of room. True, and irrelevant: it measured *before* the three
copies that actually blew it. **A measurement is only as good as where you put it.**

**Wrong turn 3: diagnosing before bisecting.** Two hypotheses were argued from arithmetic
before anyone bisected. Both were wrong.

**What worked:** semihosting exit codes as markers.

```rust
memory::alloc_loop();
semihosting::exit(31);      // do we even get here?
memory::free_loop();
```

Exit code 31 came back. The alloc loop was fine; the free loop was the problem. That single
bit of information was worth more than all the theorizing, and it took two minutes.

**Why exit codes and not prints:** the failing kernel had corrupted `.text`, and
`println!` runs through `core::fmt`, which lives in `.text`. Using the broken thing to
diagnose the broken thing is circular. A semihosting exit is a single `hlt` instruction and
two register writes ([semihosting.md](semihosting.md)). It works when almost nothing else
does.

## What we added

A **canary**: four magic words at `__stack_bottom` (`kernel/src/stack.rs`), checked after
every test, and in the panic handler and the fault handler.

**And it did not catch this bug.** Be clear about that. The overflow destroyed `.text`
before any check could run, so there was no surviving code to notice. The canary catches
the *milder* case, where an overflow dips below the stack, corrupts `.bss`, and returns.
That is worth having, and the after-each-test check pins the blame on the test that did it
rather than on some later victim. But it is a mitigation, not a fix.

**The fix is the guard page at milestone 4.** An unmapped page below `__stack_bottom` means
the MMU faults on the *first* byte written past the end, before any damage. Precise, free
at runtime, impossible to miss. That is the whole reason `link-aarch64.ld` carries a TODO about it.

## `bl` does *not* push the return address (this is not x86)

On **x86**, `call` pushes the return address onto the stack.

On **aarch64**, `bl kernel_main` ("branch with link") puts the return address in a
**register**: `x30`, also called `lr` (link register). It never touches memory.

So a call with a garbage `sp` technically succeeds. The problem arrives one instruction
later, in the callee's prologue:

```asm
stp  x29, x30, [sp, #-32]!   ; save frame pointer + link register, sp -= 32
mov  x29, sp                 ; establish the frame pointer
...                          ; locals live at [sp, #16], etc.
ldp  x29, x30, [sp], #32     ; restore them, sp += 32
ret                          ; branch to whatever is in x30
```

A function needs the stack for two reasons:

1. Its **local variables** live there.
2. It must **spill `x30` to memory** before making any call of its own, because a nested
   `bl` overwrites `x30` and would destroy its own return address.

(Corollary: a *leaf* function with no locals touches the stack not at all, and would run
fine with a garbage `sp`. Don't rely on this.)

**With a garbage `sp`, the callee's first instruction stores registers to a random
address.** Which is worse than crashing, because it might not crash. It might quietly
corrupt something and fail ten thousand instructions later.

**Rule: set `sp` before calling any Rust function.**

## Two details that will bite you

**There is no `push` or `pop` instruction.** ARM removed them. You use `stp` / `ldp`
(store pair / load pair) with pre- and post-indexed addressing. That's what the `#-32]!`
and `], #32` above are doing; the `!` means "write the updated address back into `sp`."
It is push and pop, spelled out.

**`sp` must always be 16-byte aligned.** Not 8. Sixteen. A misaligned `sp` raises an
alignment fault when used. This is why the prologue above subtracts 32 and not 24. It is
a classic source of mysterious early-boot crashes.

## One stack pointer per exception level

aarch64 does not have one stack pointer. It has **`SP_EL0`, `SP_EL1`, `SP_EL2`,
`SP_EL3`** (see [exception levels](aarch64.md)).

Consider what that buys us. A userspace program at EL0 uses `SP_EL0` and can set it to
any garbage it likes, because it's the program's own stack and its own problem. When an
exception fires and the CPU enters EL1, **the hardware automatically switches to
`SP_EL1`**, the kernel's stack pointer, which userspace cannot touch.

So a malicious or broken user program **cannot** corrupt the kernel's stack by handing it
a bad `sp`. The hardware will not allow the two to be confused. That is not a convention
the kernel enforces. It is silicon.

This is the mechanism that makes milestone 7 (user mode) safe, and it's another place
aarch64's clean-sheet design visibly beats x86, where the equivalent is bolted together
out of the TSS and a privilege-change stack switch.

## The part that connects to everything else

**A thread is, essentially, a stack plus a set of register values.**

That is not a metaphor. It is what a thread *is* at the hardware level. Two threads
running concurrently means two independent chains of nested function calls in progress,
which means two separate stacks. There is no way around it.

This is why the async-vs-preemptive decision mattered so much (see
[DECISIONS](../design/decisions/05-preemptive-threads.md) §5). Async tasks are state machines the compiler builds on
the heap, which is why they don't each need a stack, which is why async looked cheaper.
But a real user program is not a state machine we built. It is arbitrary machine code with
an arbitrary call depth, and it needs a real stack.

So **milestone 6 (threads) is really**: allocate a stack per thread, and write assembly
that saves the current register set, swaps `sp`, and restores a different register set.
That is a context switch. It's about thirty instructions, and the stack is the thing being
switched.

# The overflows of 2026-08-14

Two real kernel stack overflows in one day, on both architectures, found by CI. Written up from the
ground up, because the mechanism is worth understanding before the incident is, and because the
question "how did we introduce it" turned out to have an uncomfortable answer.

## The shape of a kernel thread stack

Every kernel thread gets **four pages, 16 KiB**, decided when the thread is created, and that is all
it will ever have. `thread::STACK_PAGES` is 4, and the figure came from what Linux uses for its own
arm64 kernel threads. **It was never measured for this tree**, which turns out to matter. *(This
section describes 2026-08-14. The next day's overflow, below, raised `STACK_PAGES` to 6, so the
worked addresses here are the old five-page stride.)*

Directly beneath it sits one unmapped page:

```
0xffffffd0001fe000  +--------------+
                    |  GUARD PAGE  |   unmapped: any access faults
0xffffffd0001ff000  +--------------+  <- stack bottom
                    |              |
                    |   16 KiB     |   frames pile downward from the top
                    |   of stack   |
0xffffffd000203000  +--------------+  <- stack top, where sp starts
```

The per-thread stride is therefore five pages (`0x5000`), guard page first, and that arithmetic is
how a faulting address gets attributed to a stack: subtract `thread::STACK_AREA`, divide by `0x5000`
for the slot, and a remainder under `0x1000` means the guard page.

**Why fixed size at all.** In userspace a stack grows on demand: run off the end and the kernel maps
more. In a kernel there is nobody underneath to do that. The size is the size.

**What the guard page buys, exactly.** Without it, overflow is silent: thread A writes below its own
stack, lands in thread B's, and B crashes later doing something unrelated, arbitrarily far from the
cause. With it, the CPU faults on the first access and the crash is precise. The guard does not
prevent overflow. It converts an invisible failure into a legible one, which is the whole of its
value.

## Why an overflow is intermittent

Depth is a property of the path, not of the binary. A test that spawns a program, faults it, reaps it
and respawns stacks far more frames than one that reads a file. Test ordering, interrupt timing and
which core picked up the work all shift it. So **the same kernel image overflows on one run and not
the next**: milestone 108's branch went four green and one red on a byte-identical binary.

That is also why "re-run it and see" is the wrong instinct. A four-in-five pass rate looks like flake
and is actually a margin that has already run out.

## How it was introduced, which is the uncomfortable part

**No single commit introduced it.** There is no bad change to point at, and the milestone that was
held for hours on suspicion of causing it had a largest new frame of **128 bytes**.

The margin was spent gradually, by ordinary code:

- **`sched::reap_region_objects` carried a 6816-byte frame**, of which 6144 was three arrays sized to
  their table maxima. `let mut doomed_eps = [0u64; MAX_ENDPOINTS]` is 4096 bytes of stack, and it
  reads as a bound rather than as an allocation. `MAX_ENDPOINTS` is 512 because that is a sensible
  ceiling on live endpoints; nothing about that number was ever a claim about stack.
- **`sched::spawn_on` carries 4592 bytes**, because a `Thread` travels by value into the thread table
  and a debug build copies it at each step rather than eliding. It is generic over the spawned
  closure, so every service gets its own instantiation: ten of them, all over the guard page.
- **Milestone 84 had already measured the peak at 11672 of 16384 bytes, 71%**, and written it in a
  table in notes/stack-high-water.md. 4712 bytes of headroom reads as comfortable. Nobody put that
  number next to a 6816-byte frame, and the two had never appeared on the same page.

Put them together and the arithmetic was impossible: **one frame wanted 2104 bytes more than all the
headroom there was.** It needed the right call chain on the right run to expose it, and when it did,
the change that happened to be in flight got the blame.

**Nothing caught it because nothing was looking.** A 6816-byte frame compiles without a warning. The
compiler will hand you a frame larger than the entire stack it will run on, because it has no idea
how big that stack is. No gate in the tree measured frame sizes until this day.

## The two faults, and what each taught

**aarch64**, on milestone 108's branch. `FAR_EL1` was `0xffff0010001b3000`, exactly the guard page of
thread stack slot 87, during the supervision and reap tests. Cause: `reap_region_objects`. Fixed by
rescanning for one endpoint at a time instead of collecting them all first, which took the frame from
6816 to 2560 bytes.

A wrong turn worth keeping: the first decode read `FAR` through `phys_to_virt` and concluded the
pointer was corrupted, because the physical half looked like `0x1b3000` with a stray bit 36. Bit 36
is `STACK_AREA` itself, placed 64 GiB up **precisely so a stack address can never collide with the
virtual name of a physical one**. A high-half address is not automatically a physmap address, and
masking off `KERNEL_VA_BASE` is not a decode until you know which region you are in.

**riscv64**, on the `thead-c906` CPU model, hours later. This one the kernel diagnosed itself, because
milestone 78's `stack::warn_if_guard_page` had merged in between:

```
*** KERNEL STACK OVERFLOW ***
0xffffffd0001fe008 is in THREAD stack slot 102's guard page (thread.rs).
```

The address is the lesson. It is **4088 bytes below the stack bottom, on a 4096-byte guard page**.
Eight more bytes and there would have been no fault at all, just a corrupted neighbour.

## The rule that came out of it

**A frame larger than the guard page defeats the guard page.** One page is 4096 bytes; a function
whose frame exceeds that can move `sp` from inside the stack to below the guard in a single step,
touching nothing in between. No access lands in the guard, so nothing faults, and the write goes into
the neighbouring thread's stack. The mechanism that makes overflow legible is bypassed entirely.

`script/stack-frame-check` gates exactly this, at 4096 rather than at any fraction of the stack, and
the first version of that gate got it wrong by picking a third of the stack instead. Ten `spawn_on`
instantiations sit over the line today, held at their current size by a ratchet until milestone 124
restructures them.

**Growing the stack does not fix this shape**, which is the counterintuitive part. `STACK_PAGES` 4 to
8 buys headroom, but **the guard page stays one page**, so an oversized frame still steps over it.
Growing the stack moves the overflow further away while leaving it silent when it finally arrives.
Shrinking the frame is what restores the fault.

## What was still open, and what closed it

Both of these were open on 2026-08-14 and both are answered below by the guard-page faults of
2026-08-16 and the walker they finally forced into the tree.

- **Per-function frames are not call chains.** `-Z emit-stack-sizes` says what one function costs, not
  which functions stack on top of each other, so it cannot produce a worst-case depth. The watermark
  in notes/stack-high-water.md is the other half. Neither is sufficient alone, and a call-graph
  walker would close the gap. **Nothing in this tree had one until `script/stack-depth-check`.**
- **The riscv64 overflow is not proven fixed.** The aarch64 cause was found and fixed; the riscv64
  fault is a different chain on a different slot, and milestone 124 is the prime suspect rather than
  a demonstrated cause. §19 parity says a fix that works on one architecture and silently not the
  other is the bug.

# The overflow of 2026-08-15, which was a different shape

One day after the section above was written, CI overflowed a thread stack again, on both ISAs, in
the same test neighbourhood: aarch64 run 31907966383 attempt 1 (slot 87, `ESR` `0x96000047`,
`ELR` `0xffff000040130214`) and riscv64 `thead-c906` run 31910308865 attempt 1 (slot 102,
`scause` `0xf`, `sepc` `0xffffffc080257aec`), both during
`supervision_tests::a_faulting_child_reports_to_its_supervisor_and_is_reaped_then_respawned`, both
immediately after the user-fault kill report, both on loaded 2-core runners, and both with `sp`
exactly 4096 bytes past the bottom of the 16 KiB stack. Later attempts of the same runs passed.
`reap_region_objects` was already fixed and `script/stack-frame-check` was already gating at the
guard page, so this was not a recurrence of the 2026-08-14 mechanism.

## Symbolizing it, and what the addresses said

The CI binaries were debug builds at known SHAs, so the honest move was to rebuild them exactly.
A local rebuild at the same SHA did NOT reproduce CI's text layout (two tries, two different
layouts: incremental compilation and something host-specific both move functions). What worked was
an `ubuntu:24.04` arm64 container with the repo mounted at CI's own path (`/home/runner/work/nife/
nife`), `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, and the pinned toolchain: cargo then reproduced CI's artifact hash
(`kernel-7f83536acfad25b4`, `kernel-04da2562c61a7429`), which makes the symbolization exact rather
than plausible.

On aarch64 the two addresses cohere into a story:

- `ELR_EL1` = `exception_vectors + 0x214`, which is the fifth `stp` of the **same-EL synchronous
  entry stub** pushing its 0x110-byte frame. The faulting store is the exception entry itself.
- `FAR_EL1` = the guard page's lowest byte, with the fault mid-guard: the entry stub had already
  cascaded. A store into the guard raises a same-EL sync abort, whose entry pushes another frame
  0x110 lower, which faults again, and so on down the guard page; the dump we finally get is the
  cascade's last inner fault, printed once a frame lands whole in the mapped page below the guard.
- `x30` = `IrqSafeMutex<Option<Scheduler>>::lock + 0x190`, the instruction after that function's
  `bl spin_loop_hint`, a value that is only live inside the **contended spin** of `SCHED.lock`.
  The thread that died
  was spinning for the scheduler lock with interrupts already masked, within ~272 bytes of its
  stack bottom, and the deepest call of the spin loop is what first touched the guard.

The riscv64 report agrees on everything measurable (`stval` = guard base, same test, same moment)
except that its `sepc` points at an `auipc` in a test-runner print, an instruction that cannot
raise a store fault. `thead-c906` under QEMU is the model whose timing already surfaced one
unrelated flake that day; treat a c906 `sepc` in this failure class as approximate and lean on
`stval`.

## The arithmetic, which is the actual cause

No single frame was over the guard page; the gate is green on the failing SHAs. The stack was
consumed by an honest sum (aarch64 debug numbers, from `-Z emit-stack-sizes`):

| layer | cost |
|---|---|
| deepest standing path the suite reaches on a thread stack | ~11.7 KiB (the measured high-water) |
| blocking from that depth: `ipc_recv` 656 + `SCHED.lock` 256 + `schedule` 448 + the switch | ~1.4 KiB, resident while blocked |
| one preemption at the deepest instant: trap frame 272 + dispatch + GIC claim + `canary::check` 592 + `schedule` 448 + contended `SCHED.lock` 256 + spin | ~2.3 KiB |

Total ~15.5 KiB against 16384 bytes, and the load correlation falls out of the last row: QEMU's
timer runs on host wall clock, so a loaded host delivers many more timer interrupts per guest
instruction, and one of them eventually lands on the deepest frame of the deepest thread, with the
scheduler lock contended by the other core's death-report work, which is why the fault sits right
after the kill report. Every layer is doing its job; the budget was simply spent.

## Why growing the stack IS the fix for this shape

The section above says "growing the stack does not fix this shape", and both sentences are right
because the shapes differ. That rule is about a **single frame bigger than the guard page**, which
steps over the guard and corrupts silently; growing the stack leaves the silent step-over silent,
and shrinking the frame is the fix. Here every frame is modest, the guard page **fired exactly as
designed**, and the failure is the sum. For a sum, the levers are shrink the chain, bound the
chain, or grow the budget:

- **Shrunk**: `sched::canary::check` reserved its whole 592-byte frame before its disarmed early
  return, on every tick, on every thread stack. It is now a ~16-byte armed-check wrapper around an
  outlined `#[inline(never)]` body (a debug prologue reserves the whole frame no matter how early
  the return; an early `return` is not an early frame).
- **Grown**: `thread::STACK_PAGES` 4 to 6 (24 KiB), sized against the sum above with ~8 KiB over
  the measured worst case, and the thread high-water tripwire moved from 14336 to 18432 so it
  alarms ~3 KiB past the measured worst-case stacking and 6 KiB before the guard. The old limit
  could pass a run whose true worst case was already past the stack, which these two CI runs
  proved by example.
- **Bounded, on 2026-08-16**: the structural fix is a per-CPU interrupt stack, so a preemption
  stops billing the interrupted thread ~2.3 KiB at its deepest instant. This bullet said "not yet
  bounded" and named it as wanting a lane of its own; it got one the next day, on both ISAs, and
  the last section of this note has the numbers and the honest account of how much they moved.
  What is still billed to the interrupted thread is the trap frame and the deferred `schedule()`.

**What the enlargement cost elsewhere, which took three suite runs to find.** Thread stacks come
from the kmem carve, not the frame allocator, and 6 pages x `MAX_THREADS` is 768 pages, the whole
768-page carve; the carve grew to 1024, which in turn took the last spare megabyte of the 128 MiB
test machine, so the machine grew to 256 MiB (both runners, and memory.rs's RAM assert moves with
them). Both exhaustions surfaced the same way: an unrelated test's spawn failing late in the
aarch64 suite with a message that ORed two causes. The refusal sites in `kmem::page` and the shell
wiring now print which budget said no.

The carve moved again on 2026-08-27, to **2048 pages**, when `sched::MAX_THREADS` doubled to 256:
seven pages a live thread (six of stack, one of TCB) is 1792, endpoints are about 60, and the rest
is slack. The machine did not have to grow with it this time, because 256 MiB already had the room.
See `kmem::KERNEL_OBJ_PAGES` for the arithmetic and `sched::MAX_THREADS` for why the ceiling moved.

**The repeated fault address is a signature, not a coincidence.** Every guard-page fault in this
family lands on the guard page's base (aarch64) or base and base+8 (riscv64), across days and
across fixes, and that is arithmetic rather than evidence of one recurring caller: `sp` is 16-byte
aligned, the entry stub's stores walk upward from `sp`, and the cascade only ends once a frame
clears the page-aligned guard base, so the terminal faulting store is always the first aligned
address at or above the base. aarch64's 16-byte `stp`s give exactly the base; riscv64's 8-byte
`sd`s give base or base+8, which are precisely the two values ever observed. A depth-driven
overflow through the entry-stub cascade therefore DOES repeat an address, exactly this one; do not
read address stability as proof of a single fixed-site writer.

The overflow report also got the instrument this diagnosis lacked: on a thread-guard fault,
`stack::warn_if_guard_page` now prints every word of the dead stack that points into `.text`,
deepest first. This kernel keeps no frame pointers, so that conservative scan is the only
backtrace it can produce, and it turns the next CI-only report into a symbolizable chain instead
of a container-rebuild archaeology project.

# The guard-page faults of 2026-08-16, which were not overflows

Two more guard-page faults, one per architecture, in the same test
(`user::supervision_tests::a_faulting_child_reports_to_its_supervisor_and_is_reaped_then_respawned`),
intermittent on both. They read exactly like the 2026-08-14 pair above and they are a different
thing, and the reason the difference took a day to see is that **the kernel's own report asserted
the wrong half of it.**

## What the two faults said

```

## The fact that settles it, and the tree was already holding every piece of it

**There are two addresses, not six faults.** Every recorded guard-page fault on this project lands
on one of exactly two, and they were written down in three different files over five days without
anyone putting them side by side:

| when | where recorded | address | slot |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-11ish, two `cpu matrix` runs | `sched.rs`, `guard_page_at`'s doc | `0xffffffd0001fe000` | riscv64 slot 102 |
| 2026-08-13, one run in five | notes/frames.md, milestone 108's BUGS | `0xffff0010001b3000` | aarch64 slot 87 |
| 2026-08-14 | this file, "the overflows of 2026-08-14" | `0xffffffd0001fe008` | riscv64 slot 102 |
| 2026-08-16, merge queue | above | `0xffff0010001b3000` | aarch64 slot 87 |
| 2026-08-16, PR #213 `cpu matrix` | above | `0xffffffd0001fe008` | riscv64 slot 102 |

Same slot per architecture, every time, over five days, across milestone 124's restructuring of the
entire spawn path (the worst `spawn_on` instantiation went from 4592 bytes to 1040) and across
#157's fix to `reap_region_objects`. The addresses did not move by one byte.

**A depth-driven overflow cannot do that.** Depth is a property of which calls ran and when an
interrupt landed, which this note says in its own words two sections up ("the same kernel image
overflows on one run and not the next"). An overflow's faulting address wanders with the chain that
produced it. These do not wander at all. That is a fixed computation landing on a fixed address, and
the intermittency is in whether the path runs, not in where it ends up.

**And one register in the 2026-08-13 dump argues the same thing, directly under the sentence that
concluded the opposite.** notes/frames.md records `x8 = 0xffff0010001b7a90` and reads it correctly
as slot 87's own stack, "1392 bytes below its top", and then concludes "a 16 KiB kernel stack ran
out". A stack with 1392 bytes used has not run out; it has used 8% of itself. The two sentences are
adjacent and only one of them can be true.

**That argument is wrong, twice over, and this file already contained both refutations** (2026-08-17).
The paragraph above it is a near-verbatim duplicate, and the claim they share is answered by "The
repeated fault address is a signature, not a coincidence" forty lines earlier in the 2026-08-15
section: **any** fault that reaches the exception vector's own frame store cascades down to the same
slot base, because the walk terminates at the first `sp` whose whole frame clears the guard and the
stores run upward from `sp` in 16-byte steps. So a wandering `sp` produces a fixed *reported*
address, and address stability says nothing about the writer. What it does say is which **slot**,
and that turned out to be the real signal: slot 87 survived `STACK_PAGES` going 4 to 6, which changed
the address and not the index, so what repeats is a position in the allocation sequence. See "a
kernel stack freed under its owner" at the end of this file. The verdict here (not depth) was right;
the reasoning was not, and the reasoning is what a reader would have carried forward.

That also revises the 2026-08-14 entry above. Its aarch64 fault was attributed to
`sched::reap_region_objects`'s 6816-byte frame and closed by #157; the same address came back after
that fix and after milestone 124's. Either the attribution was wrong, or there were two faults at
one address and only one of them was fixed. The frame *was* real and shrinking it *was* right (a
frame larger than the guard page defeats the guard page regardless), so nothing about that work is
wasted. But it did not close this.

## The arithmetic that says it is not depth

**The deepest chain a kernel thread stack can carry is 13792 bytes on aarch64 and 13344 on
riscv64**, measured by `script/stack-depth-check` over the same test binary CI builds:

| | aarch64 | riscv64 |
|---|---|---|
| longest chain from `thread_entry` (a kernel thread's own work) | 9456 | 9168 |
| trap frame the vector builds | 272 | 288 |
| handler chain that can nest on kernel code (no syscall or user-fault arm) | 4064 | 3888 |
| **worst total on a 16384-byte stack** | **13792** | **13344** |
| measured high water, milestone 84's watermark, 31 runs on this machine | 9536 to 10600 | 9344 |

(The aarch64 handler row read 3984 before this work and 4064 after, because the `sp` line added to
`warn_if_guard_page` is itself on the fault path. Eighty bytes to make the report say what it
measures is worth it, and the instrument noticing its own cost is the sort of thing that says it is
measuring the right binary.)

Two things make that close to a bound. The call graph is **acyclic**: no recursion, so the longest
path is the worst case for everything the graph contains. And **no frame over the 4096-byte guard
page is reachable from a thread-stack entry point at all** on either ISA, so milestone 124's fix
does cover every path that reaches a thread, and the frame-jumps-the-guard hazard is genuinely
closed there.

**The third thing is where the measurement lands, and it took two corrections to state properly.**
A first draft said the walker and the watermark agreed to the byte on aarch64 at 9536, which came
from a script still mis-parsing RISC-V local labels. A second said the watermark ran 80 to 176 bytes
*above* the walker's `thread_entry` chain, and blamed the walker's blind spot for assembly frames.
Then 31 aarch64 runs produced 9536 twenty-nine times, 9640 once, and **10600 once**, which is 1144
bytes above that chain and too much for `switch_to`'s 96 bytes to explain.

The second draft was comparing the wrong two numbers. **The watermark measures whatever was on the
stack, nested traps included**; the `thread_entry` chain is only the thread's own work, with no trap
on top. The comparison that means something is against the composed row: a timer interrupt landing
near the deepest point costs a 272-byte trap frame plus a handler, which is exactly the shape of a
1144-byte excursion, and the walker's own model of that is the 13792 in the table. So:

    thread_entry chain   9456    the thread's own work, no trap
    measured watermark   9536 to 10600    what actually happened, traps included
    composed worst       13792   the bound, chain + trap frame + nestable handler

The measurement sits between them, which is where it should sit, and the bound is not contradicted
by anything measured. It is still a **lower** bound in principle, because indirect calls and
assembly frames are invisible to the walker, and the honest reason to trust it here is the size of
the gap it is being used across rather than its precision: 10600 measured against a 20480 the fault
would require.

The riscv64 watermark is one run on this machine, not the 11672 in notes/stack-high-water.md's
table. **That number predates milestone 124**, which took the worst `spawn_on` instantiation from
4592 bytes to 1040, so it describes a kernel that no longer exists.

A fault at a slot's guard-page **base** needs `sp` at 20480 bytes into a 16384-byte stack. That is
6768 bytes deeper than the modelled worst case and 9880 deeper than the deepest thing 31 runs of the
suite ever measured. The walker's imprecision is measured in hundreds of bytes and the gap is
measured in thousands, which is the only reason the imprecision does not matter here.

## What the report was actually entitled to say

`stack::warn_if_guard_page` derived every line from the faulting **address** and then wrote "so sp
went N bytes past it", which is a claim about the stack **pointer** that the function never read.
The two agree only when the fault is `sp` walking off the end.

And the addresses point away from that reading. Both landed at **guard-page offset 0 and 8**, the
far end of the guard, 4096 and 4088 bytes below their stack's bottom. A gradual overflow arrives at
the *near* end, within a few hundred bytes of the bottom. Offset 0 is also, exactly, **one word past
the top of the stack in the slot below**: the slots are contiguous and each slot's guard page is its
first page, so `slot N guard base == slot N-1 stack top`. Six faults, two ISAs, every one within
eight bytes of that boundary.

The handler argues `sp` was mapped, too. On aarch64 the vector's `SAVE_CONTEXT` builds a 272-byte
frame at the live `SP_EL1` before any Rust runs; if `sp` had been inside the unmapped guard, that
store would have faulted again. It printed a full register dump instead. RISC-V's `trap.s` stays on
the interrupted `sp` for an S-mode trap and has the same property. (That argument is not airtight,
and the next subsection is why: aarch64 recovers from a nested vector fault by walking `sp` down
until the frame fits. It is refuted on other grounds.)

So the report now prints `sp` beside the faulting address in the same units and lets the reader
compare, rather than asserting the answer. `kernel/src/stack.rs`, with
`sched::tests::a_slots_guard_page_begins_where_the_slot_below_it_ends` pinning the geometry the
comparison rests on.

### A model that fits the offsets exactly, and why it is still wrong

Worth writing down because it is the reading a careful person reaches next, and because refuting it
costs an hour the second time.

**The two fault offsets are the two ISAs' first trap-frame stores.** aarch64's `SAVE_CONTEXT` opens
`sub sp, sp, #272` then `stp x0, x1, [sp, #16 * 0]`, a store at **sp + 0**. RISC-V's `trap_entry`
opens `addi sp, sp, -288` then `sd x1, 1*8(sp)`, a store at **sp + 8**. The faults are at guard base
**+ 0** and **+ 8**. So: if `sp` were exactly a slot's guard base at trap entry, each ISA's first
store lands precisely where its fault did.

That model even survives the double-fault objection. aarch64 has no double fault; a store fault in
`SAVE_CONTEXT` re-enters the same vector with `sp` another 272 lower, and after one step `sp` is
inside the previous slot's mapped stack, so the frame builds, `exception_dispatch` runs, and
`FAR_EL1` still holds the first failing address. The register dump would be the original context's
(nothing before the store touches `x0`..`x30`), and `SPSR_EL1` would read EL1h with all of `DAIF`
set, which is exactly the `0x3c5` in the aarch64 dump.

**`ELR_EL1` refutes it.** Under that model the reported `ELR` is the PC of the *previous* level's
faulting instruction, which is the `stp` inside the vector table. The dump reads
`0xffff00004013a228`. Two local builds of this tree, with different metadata hashes, both place
`exception_vectors` at `0xffff0000400b4000` and agree instruction for instruction around it, so the
assembly's position is stable across builds and the faulting instruction was ordinary Rust roughly
550 KB further into `.text`. The failing CI build is a different commit and its layout is not
knowable from here, but it is main plus a 59-line markdown pull request, and that does not move half
a megabyte of code.

**That paragraph is wrong, and it is the single sentence that sent this reopening after a stray
store for a day** (2026-08-17). It reads a **CI** `ELR` against a **local** build's
`exception_vectors`, in a file whose own 2026-08-15 section had already measured CI's vector base at
`0xffff000040130000`, half a megabyte from the local one. Corrected: `0xffff00004013a228` is
`exception_vectors + 0x228` in that build, the tenth `stp` of the same-EL synchronous entry stub, and
the walk is exactly what happened. `ELR` does not refute the model; in all three aarch64 dumps it
confirms it, and the offsets pin `sp` to the window the arithmetic predicts. See the last section of
this file, "a kernel stack freed under its owner". The rest of this subsection is right and is the
model that turned out to be the answer.

## What it therefore is, and what is still open

**Not settled.** What is settled is what it is *not*: not thread-stack depth, not a frame larger
than the guard page, and not the class milestone 124 closed. What remains, in order of what the
addresses support:

- **A store one or two words past the top of a kernel stack**, from a pointer that treats a stack
  top as inclusive rather than exclusive, or from a stale pointer into a slot whose `KernelStack`
  has been dropped and whose address range went back to `FREE_STACK_VAS`. Every in-tree computation
  from a `KernelStack` was read for this and each is exclusive at the top
  (`paint`/`high_water` over `[bottom, top)`, `spawn_into`'s closure slot and `Context`,
  `arm_for_start`, `enter_frame`'s `top - 272`, `user_pc`), so if this is the shape, the pointer is
  not one of those or it is being used after its stack died.
- **A stray store through a corrupted pointer** that happens to name a slot base. Six faults across
  five days landing on two addresses argues against a random one, and argues for a computation with
  a fixed input.

**And the search space is small, which is the encouraging part.** Only three places in the kernel
can name a slot *base* at all: `KernelStack::new` (which holds it as `base` and `guard`), its `Drop`
(which pushes `self.guard` back to `FREE_STACK_VAS`), and the arithmetic in `stack.rs` that turns an
address into a slot. `grep` for `STACK_AREA`, `STACK_SLOT_SPAN`, `NEXT_STACK_VA` and
`FREE_STACK_VAS` finds nothing else outside tests. Whatever stores there either derives the address
from one of those, or does not know it is a stack address at all.

**The two slot numbers are themselves a clue nobody has spent.** Why 87 on aarch64 and 102 on
riscv64, every time? A slot index is `(va - STACK_AREA) / 0x5000`, so a repeatable index means a
repeatable *count* of stacks handed out before the offending one. Whatever computes the faulting
address is reached at the same point in the same suite on each run, which is another way of saying
this is deterministic in the sequence of allocations and not in the timing. The intermittency then
has to come from something else deciding whether that path runs at all, not from where it lands.

**It did not reproduce here, and that is a result rather than a gap in the effort.** 31 full-suite
aarch64 runs under host load on a 4-CPU Linux box, `-smp 4` under TCG, every one green, plus a green
riscv64 leg. The thread watermark read **9536 twenty-nine times, 9640 once, and 10600 once**, which
is worth recording on its own: the depth is a near-constant with occasional excursions of the size a
nested trap frame explains, and it is nothing like a stack that intermittently runs 4096 bytes past
its own bottom. The reproduction cost is the honest blocker: CI hit it perhaps two runs in six, on a
runner this machine does not resemble. A hunt harness that restores the fixture images and stands in
for xtask's two host actors got the cycle to about 32 seconds, and 32 seconds times zero failures is
still zero information about the cause.

**The next occurrence should be legible without another investigation**, which is what the `sp` line
buys. If it prints a slot *below* the faulting address, the store-past-the-top reading is confirmed
and the search narrows to pointers derived from a stack top. If it prints the same slot, the depth
reading comes back and the walker's bound is wrong somewhere, which would mean an indirect call it
cannot see.

# The per-CPU interrupt stack (milestone 124, 2026-08-16)

Everything above this line describes a kernel in which **an interrupt was paid for by whoever it
interrupted**. This section is the change that stopped that, and the honest account of how much it
bought, which is less than the headline suggests and in a different currency.

## The shape of the old cost

A trap arrives. The vector saves a frame at the live `sp`, and every frame of the handler above it
is built on the same stack, which is whichever stack was running: a kernel thread's 24 KiB, a
secondary's 64 KiB idle stack, or the boot stack the test suite runs on. So a kernel thread's stack
had to hold **its own deepest chain plus a whole interrupt**, and the interrupt could arrive at the
worst instant by definition, because that is what "asynchronous" means.

The 2026-08-15 section above has the arithmetic: ~11.7 KiB of thread, ~1.4 KiB resident while
blocked, and ~2.3 KiB for one preemption landing at the deepest point. Fifteen and a half of
sixteen. `STACK_PAGES` went 4 to 6 in response, and that block said in the same breath that growing
the stack was the interim and **bounding the interrupt was the fix**.

## What was built

One stack per core, 16 KiB over its own unmapped guard page, in a `(NOLOAD)` region beside the
secondary stacks (`.interrupt_stacks`, laid out by `kernel/src/interrupt_stack.rs`). A trap **from
kernel mode** saves its frame where it always did and then runs the handler over there; a trap from
user mode does not switch at all.

The mechanism is deliberately small. Rust decides (`interrupt_stack::top_for_trap`, which answers 0
for "stay") and three instructions of assembly move `sp`
(`dispatch_on_interrupt_stack` in vectors.s and trap.s). The dispatcher is split in two: an outer
half on the interrupted stack, and a body that runs on the interrupt stack.

**Three things do not move, and each is a constraint rather than an omission.**

- **The trap frame.** A preempted thread's frame must still be there when that thread runs again,
  arbitrarily later, and a per-core stack cannot promise that. 272 bytes on aarch64, 288 on riscv64,
  still billed to the interrupted stack.
- **A trap from user mode.** That thread's kernel stack is empty at the moment it traps, so there is
  nothing to relieve, and the syscall it is probably taking may **block**, which means its frames
  have to live on a stack that belongs to the thread.
- **The deferred `schedule()`.** This is the one that shapes the whole design, below.

## The one rule: nothing on an interrupt stack may context-switch away from it

A switch parks the running `sp` in the outgoing thread's `Context` and resumes it there later. Park
a per-core address and the thread comes back on bytes the next interrupt on that core has already
spent. That corrupts a stack rather than faulting, which puts it in the worst class of bug this
project has: invisible at the site, fatal somewhere else.

So the four lines of preemption moved out of `handle_irq` (and its riscv64 twin, where they had been
written twice and had already drifted in their comments) into `sched::preempt_if_needed`, called by
the dispatcher's **outer** half, which is provably back on the interrupted thread's own stack.

Three mechanisms hold the rule, and the overlap is deliberate:

1. `sched::schedule` debug-asserts that `sp` is not on an interrupt stack.
2. `script/stack-depth-check` proves in CI, on both ISAs, that no context switch is *reachable* in
   the call graph from the interrupt-stack entry point. This is the strong one: it is a static
   property of the binary, checked every build, and it does not need the bad path to run.
3. The paragraph in `interrupt_stack.rs`, at the thing itself.

## What it measured, before and after

**The static bound moved less than the headline suggests, and that is the interesting part.**
`script/stack-depth-check`, which walks the call graph and hangs `-Z emit-stack-sizes` frames on it:

| at base commit `e56ae848` | aarch64 | riscv64 |
|---|---|---|
| handler chain a kernel-mode trap could leave on the interrupted stack, **before** | 3984 | 3888 |
| the same, **after** | 3728 | 3552 |
| deepest chain the interrupt stack itself carries (of 16384) | 3984 | 3888 |
| worst total on a thread stack, before | 13712 | 13344 |
| worst total on a thread stack, after | 13456 | 13008 |

**Take these from a run and not from here**, which the milestone 124 block says of its own numbers
for a reason this table then demonstrated. Merging `main` an hour later moved the aarch64 row from
3728 to 3904 and the total to 13632, with nothing in this change touching it: other lanes had
deepened what `schedule()` can reach. The riscv64 rows did not move. The gate prints the numbers and
the gate is the authority.

**A 256-byte improvement in the worst-case bound is not what "moving 2.3 KiB off the thread" sounds
like, and the reason is worth reading.** The remaining 3728 bytes are almost entirely
`schedule()`'s own chain: `preempt_if_needed` 16, `schedule` 448, `finish_switch` 224, and then the
reaper freeing a finished predecessor's address space, plus the panic-and-print tail the walker
appends to any chain that can reach a `panic!`. Every byte of that is **the cost of scheduling at
all**, which a thread already pays when it blocks voluntarily in `ipc_recv`. What used to sit beside
it on the thread stack, and now cannot, is the handler: the GIC or PLIC claim, the tick, the
watchdog (whose `dump_threads` alone carries a 1728-byte frame in a test build), the inbox drain,
the interrupt routing.

**And the measured watermark did not move at all, which is the other half of the honest answer.**
The suite was run on the same machine either side of the change, and every painted stack read the
same number to the byte:

| high-water, one full suite run | aarch64 before | aarch64 after | riscv64 before | riscv64 after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| boot (64 KiB) | 53936 | 53936 | 54344 | 54344 |
| secondary (64 KiB) | 6624 | 6624 | 6568 | 6568 |
| thread (24 KiB) | 9536 | 9536 | 9344 | 9344 |
| **interrupt (16 KiB)** | n/a | **976** | n/a | **1088** |

(The aarch64 interrupt row reads **1024** on the merged tree rather than 976, 48 bytes more, because
`top_for_trap` became `#[inline(always)]` for the icount reason below and its locals now sit in the
dispatcher's frame. Fifteen further suite runs, ten aarch64 and five riscv64, reproduced every number
in this table to the byte.)

Read it carefully, because it says two things and only one of them is comfortable. The handler is
demonstrably running over there: ~1 KiB of a previously unpainted stack is now used, which nothing
but the switch could have done. And **nothing got shallower**, which means that in this suite the
deepest byte of every other stack was reached by ordinary code rather than by an interrupt landing
on top of it. That is exactly what a watermark can and cannot say: the interrupt-at-the-worst-instant
case is rare (which is why the CI fault was intermittent, one run in six), and a measurement of what
did happen has nothing to report about a case that did not.

So the honest statement of what changed is not "the thread's worst case dropped by a third". It is:

> **After this, a preemption costs the interrupted thread a trap frame plus the same scheduler tail
> it would have paid to block on its own. The handler is bounded on a stack of its own.**

That is a structural property rather than a number, and it is the one that stops the budget being
spent by accident: a handler that grows now trips `script/stack-depth-check`'s interrupt-stack
ceiling or the high-water gate on that stack, instead of quietly making every thread's margin
smaller.

## `STACK_PAGES` could come down, and deliberately did not

The measured case for 6 pages was the ~15.5 KiB sum above, of which ~1.6 KiB has now moved. At 5
pages (20 KiB) the static worst case of 13456 still fits with 6.6 KiB spare, and 4 pages (16 KiB, the
size that overflowed in CI on 2026-08-15) fits the static bound with 2.5 KiB spare.

**It stays at 6.** #225 raised it one day earlier with a measurement in hand, after a real overflow
in CI, and lowering it needs its own measurement rather than the argument that something else got
better. The number to beat is a *measured* worst case under load on the runner that produced the
fault, not a static bound computed on a laptop. Nothing here produces that number, so nothing here
is entitled to spend it. It is a lane of its own, and the instruments it needs now exist.

## What it cost

**160 KiB of RAM and address space**: `MAX_CPUS` (8) slots of 16 KiB stack over a 4 KiB guard,
whether or not a core ever fills the seat, exactly like the secondary stacks beside them. It is a
`(NOLOAD)` region, so the flat image does not grow; `__image_size` does, which is what tells the
bootloader the memory is ours.

**And instructions per trap, which the icount tripwire caught and which is the more interesting
half.** The first version failed `script/bench --check` on three benchmarks at once: `ctx_switch`
+49.7%, `ipc_rtt_el0` +26.5%, `sink_throughput` +17.5%. None of those is a trap-heavy benchmark in
the way `null_syscall` is, and that pattern was the clue: **all three are scheduler-heavy**, and the
cost was the `debug_assert!` in `schedule()`. It asked each of eight slots in turn through two
non-inlined helpers, which is the obvious way to write "is this address in one of these ranges" and
costs about 145 ticks per context switch in the debug build the tripwire measures. Rewritten as one
subtraction against the contiguous region, all three returned inside the band.

Two smaller ones followed from asking a question one more time per trap, and both are worth knowing
because they are properties of the *debug* build rather than of the code:

- `interrupt_stack::top_for_trap` and `contains` are `#[inline(always)]`, for a measured reason. A
  debug build inlines nothing, so a policy function that answers on its first branch still costs a
  frame, a prologue and a return on every trap.
- `from_lower_el` was `(8..=11).contains(&index)`, which compiles to a **real call into
  `RangeInclusive::<u64>::contains::<u64>`** at `-O0`, on every trap, three times over. Written as
  two comparisons it is free, and that alone more than paid for this milestone's extra dispatcher
  frame: `null_syscall` ended **11.7% faster than its old baseline on aarch64** while riscv64, which
  had no equivalent generic call to lose, paid the split at +10.1%. Both baselines were re-recorded
  in their own commit; nothing else moved by more than 1.9%, so nothing else was touched.

## BUGS

- **An overflow whose first fault is the vector's own frame store still cascades.** The vector saves
  before any Rust can decide to switch, so this does not rescue a stack that is already past its
  guard; it makes reaching that state much less likely. The cascade is described under the
  2026-08-15 section above and is unchanged.
- **The static bound is a lower bound**, for the reasons `script/stack-depth-check`'s own BUGS
  section gives: indirect calls and assembly frames are invisible to a call-graph walker. The
  trampoline's own 32 bytes (aarch64) and 16 (riscv64) are exactly such a frame, uncounted.
- **The debug assertion in `schedule()` is debug-only.** A release kernel relies on the static proof
  and on review. That is the right trade on the hottest path in the kernel, and it is an exception
  worth naming rather than assuming.
- **Nothing measures the interrupt stack on a release build.** The paint-and-scan instrument is
  `cfg(test)`, like every other stack's, so the number in the report is the test suite's depth and
  not the shell's or the board tour's.

# The answer: a kernel stack freed under its owner (2026-08-17)

**Everything above this line about "two addresses, six faults" reached the right verdict on depth
and the wrong reason for it, and the wrong reason sent a lane hunting a stray store that does not
exist.** This section is what the faults actually were. It supersedes "The guard-page faults of
2026-08-16, which were not overflows" wherever the two disagree; that section's *conclusion* (not
depth, not a frame over the guard, not the class milestone 124 closed) stands.

**In one sentence:** a supervised corpse is marked `Dead` and its death message delivered while it
is **still executing on its own kernel stack**, and an out-of-band reaper on another core is
allowed to free that stack in the few hundred instructions before the corpse reaches `switch_to`.
The corpse then stores to unmapped memory, the exception vector's own frame store faults on the
same stack, and the vector walks `sp` down one 272-byte frame at a time until it lands in the
mapped stack of the slot below. The address that gets reported is the last step of that walk, and
**arithmetic pins it to the slot's base every single time**.

## Why the address never moved, which is the fact the reopening was built on

It never moved because it *cannot* move. Nothing about it is evidence of a fixed-site writer.

aarch64's `SAVE_CONTEXT` opens `sub sp, sp, #272` and then stores `stp` pairs at `[sp, #16*0]`
through `[sp, #16*16]`, walking **upward** from `sp`. If a level of the walk faults, the next level
starts 272 lower and stores upward again. Let `G` be the guard-page base the report names.

- A level faults iff some store address lands at or above `G` (unmapped), i.e. iff `sp + 256 >= G`.
- A level succeeds iff `sp + 256 < G`, so the walk terminates at the first `sp < G - 256`.
- The terminal *failing* level therefore has `sp` in `[G - 256, G)`. It stores from offset 0 upward,
  so it faults at the **first** offset `k` with `sp + k >= G`.
- `sp` is 16-byte aligned, the offsets step by 16, and `G` is page-aligned, so `G - sp` is a
  multiple of 16 and there is always an offset landing on `G` **exactly**.

So `FAR_EL1` is exactly `G`, always, for any overflow that reaches the vector cascade. RISC-V's
`trap_entry` does the same thing with `sd` at `1*8(sp)` through `31*8(sp)`, which gives `G` when
`sp < G` and `G + 8` when `sp == G` exactly. **Those are precisely the two riscv64 addresses ever
recorded**, and this file said so in the 2026-08-15 section ("The repeated fault address is a
signature, not a coincidence") forty lines before the 2026-08-16 section asserted the opposite.

## And `ELR_EL1` says the same thing, in all three aarch64 dumps

The walk is not a hypothesis about these faults. Each dump's `ELR` names the exact `stp` that
faulted, and `stp`'s offset says where `sp` was:

| when | run | `ELR_EL1` | `ELR mod 0x800` | the instruction | implied `sp` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-13 | notes/frames.md | `0xffff00004012fa34` | `0x234` | `stp x24, x25, [sp, #16*12]` | `G - 192` |
| 2026-08-15 | 31907966383 | `0xffff000040130214` | `0x214` | `stp x8, x9, [sp, #16*4]` | `G - 64` |
| 2026-08-16 | 31920141776 | `0xffff00004013a228` | `0x228` | `stp x18, x19, [sp, #16*9]` | `G - 144` |

`VBAR_EL1` requires 2048-byte alignment and `vectors.s` is `.balign 0x800`, so `ELR mod 0x800` is
the offset into the table; `0x200` is the **Current EL, SP_ELx, Synchronous** entry, which is the
exception every one of these dumps reports. Entry 4 begins with `sub sp, sp, #272` at `+0x200` and
then one `stp` every four bytes, so `+0x214`, `+0x228` and `+0x234` are the 5th, 10th and 13th
`stp`: store offsets 64, 144 and 192. Every implied `sp` lands inside the `[G - 256, G)` window the
arithmetic above predicts, and every one is a multiple of 16 below `G`. Three dumps, three
independent confirmations, and the middle one was already confirmed by a container rebuild.

**One of those three is where this file went wrong, and the mistake is worth naming.** The 2026-08-16
section reasoned that `ELR = 0xffff00004013a228` was "ordinary Rust roughly 550 KB further into
`.text`" because two **local** builds place `exception_vectors` at `0xffff0000400b4000`. But its own
2026-08-15 section had already established that **CI's** vector base was `0xffff000040130000`, half a
megabyte away from the local one, for a build a day older. A local address was used to read a CI
address in a file that had already measured the two to be different. This file's own rule covers it:
take the number from the run, not from here.

## The fourth occurrence, which is the one that names the mechanism

CI run **31960738448** (merge queue, pull request #249, 2026-08-16 17:09Z), same test, slot 87
again, now at `0xffff001000261000` because `STACK_PAGES` had gone 4 to 6 and the slot span with it.
**The slot number survived a change to the address arithmetic**, which is what says the thing being
repeated is a position in the allocation sequence rather than an address.

This was the first firing after milestone 124 added the conservative `.text` scan, and the scan
faulted:

```
  *** KERNEL STACK OVERFLOW ***
  0xffff001000261000 is in THREAD stack slot 87's guard page (thread.rs).
  bottom 0xffff001000262000, ...
  Words on the dead stack that point into .text (...), deepest first,
  as `bottom+offset: word` ...
                                          <- nothing, and then a NEW exception:
  ESR_EL1   0x0000000096000007            <- DFSC 0x07, translation fault, WnR 0: a READ
  FAR_EL1   0xffff001000262000            <- exactly `bottom`
  x8        0xffff001000262000            <- exactly the scan's cursor
```

**Slot 87's stack is not mapped.** The scan's first read of the first word took a translation fault.
A live thread cannot be running on an unmapped stack and cannot overflow one, so this is not a
thread running out of room; the stack was **freed**, and the walk that produced the guard-base
address came down through seven unmapped pages to reach the mapped stack below.

That nested fault also destroyed `ELR_EL1` and `FAR_EL1` before either was printed, and suppressed
the `sp` line the same change had added. The instrument ate its own report on its first real
firing. Both halves are fixed in `stack.rs` (the scan runs last, and asks `mmu::translate` before
each page), and its `BUGS` section carries the story.

## The mechanism, in `sched.rs`

`depart()` is a thread's last act. For a supervised thread it does this, and the comment two lines
above the release already knows the danger:

```rust
{
    let mut guard = SCHED.lock();
    ...
    t.handshake.state = State::Dead;
    deliver_death(sched, current, ep, msg);   // wakes the supervisor, possibly on another core
    // "Not requeued and not removed: we are still on this stack."
}                                             // <-- SCHED released HERE
schedule();                                   // <-- switch_to is still ahead of us
```

Between that closing brace and `switch_to` inside `schedule()`, the corpse is `Dead` in the thread
table and **still standing on its own kernel stack**. The supervisor it just woke can, on another
core, receive the death message and reclaim the child's region. That path is
`reap_supervised` -> `reclaim_region` -> `reap_region_objects`, whose refuse phase asks only about
`state`:

```rust
matches!(t.handshake.state, State::Ready | State::Running | State::Blocked)
```

`Dead` is none of those, so nothing refuses, the removal phase runs `Threads::remove`, that drops
the `Thread`, and `KernelStack::drop` unmaps all six pages **with a real `tlbi`**. The corpse's next
store faults.

**The kernel already has the flag that answers this and the reap path never asks it.**
`Handshake::on_cpu` means exactly "a core is standing on this thread's stack"; it is set until that
core's successor runs `finish_switch`, which is the two-part reaper's whole design and is documented
in those words: *"Dropping the `Thread` unmaps its stack and frees its address space, which is
exactly why it must not happen while any core still stands on it."* `finish_switch` obeys that.
`reap_region_objects` does not, because it reasoned from `state` and `Dead` genuinely does mean
"never runs again". Never runs again is not the same as off its stack, and that is the whole bug.

`Finished` and `Embryo` are removed by the same phase and have the same exposure; `Dead` is simply
the one a supervisor can reach on purpose, at speed, from another core.

## Why this test, why intermittent, and why only CI

`supervision_tests::a_faulting_child_reports_to_its_supervisor_and_is_reaped_then_respawned` is the
only place in the suite where a supervisor is woken by a corpse and reclaims that corpse's region
**immediately**, with four assertions between the `ipc_recv` and the `reclaim_region`. That is a
race between a few hundred instructions on the test's core and a few hundred on the corpse's, which
is why it is one run in six on a loaded 2-core runner and zero runs in 45 on an idle laptop. Every
other reap in the suite either goes through `wait_for` or reaps a thread that has long since
switched away.

It is also why no fix moved it. Shrinking `reap_region_objects` (#157), rebuilding the spawn path
(milestone 124), and moving the handler to a per-CPU interrupt stack all changed depth, and depth
was never the variable.

## What was ruled out, and how

- **Thread-stack depth.** `script/stack-depth-check` bounds the deepest chain at ~13.5 KiB against a
  24 KiB stack, the graph is acyclic, and no frame over the guard page is reachable from a thread
  entry point. Independently: slot 87's stack is *unmapped* in the fourth dump, and depth cannot
  unmap a page.
- **A frame larger than the guard page.** `script/stack-frame-check` gates every frame under 4096
  bytes on both ISAs and reports "no ratchet".
- **A stray store from a fixed site.** The address is forced by the vector walk's arithmetic, which
  this file derives above and which predicts `G` on aarch64 and `G`/`G+8` on riscv64 without any
  writer at all. The search for "the three places that can name a slot base" was answering a
  question that had no fault behind it.
- **A pointer treating a stack top as inclusive.** Same: the offsets are the walk's, not a
  neighbour's-top store's. The earlier reading of `x8 = 0xffff0010001b7a90` ("1392 bytes below slot
  87's top, so the stack has not run out") was the right objection to the depth story and is exactly
  what a use-after-free predicts: the corpse was *shallow* on its own stack when the pages vanished.
- **An ordering bug in the weak memory model.** Not needed. Every step here happens under `SCHED`
  on one side and outside it on the other; the window is plain mutual exclusion missing a
  precondition, not a reordering.

## The fix, and the one it is not

The fix is one clause: **an out-of-band reaper refuses a thread that is still `on_cpu`**, whatever
its state, and refuses it *without* arming a kill (it is already dead). The corpse is off its stack
one context switch later, so the caller's retry succeeds. `reclaim_region`'s contract is already
refuse-and-retry, and the supervision test's own last assertion already wraps a reclaim in
`wait_for`; the failing one now does the same.

**The better fix, not taken here, is worth writing down.** The window exists because a thread is
published as `Dead` before it is off its stack. Marking it `Departing` in `depart()` and promoting
it to `Dead` from `finish_switch` (which already holds `SCHED`, and which already runs at exactly
the instant the stack is free) would delete the window instead of refusing inside it, and no caller
would ever see a transient refusal. That is a change to the death protocol and to `RunState`, which
lives in `crates/thread_wake_handshake` where loom searches the transitions, so it is a lane and a decision
of its own rather than a hotfix. See milestone 124's block.

## BUGS

- **The refusal is a race the caller can still see**, one context switch wide, and it is now a
  `NotPermitted`/`Err` rather than a corrupted kernel. Any caller that reclaims a region containing
  a just-dead thread must retry; `wait_for` is the in-tree idiom.
- **`Finished` and `Embryo` residents get the same guard and have never been observed to hit it.**
  The guard is on `on_cpu` rather than on `Dead` precisely so it does not depend on which state was
  the one that bit.
- **Nothing statically prevents the next out-of-band remover from forgetting `on_cpu`.** The guard
  is a condition in one function, which is rung two of AGENTS.md's ladder. Rung one would be a type
  that cannot name a still-standing thread, and this tree does not have one.
- **The riscv64 dumps have no symbolized `sepc`**, so the vector-walk confirmation above is aarch64's
  three dumps plus riscv64's address arithmetic. The mechanism is architecture-independent (it is in
  `sched.rs`) and the `on_cpu` guard is too, so parity holds by construction rather than by a second
  set of dumps.
