# The stack, `sp`, and `x30`

## What problem it solves

A function needs scratch space: somewhere for its local variables, and somewhere to park
`x30` when it calls something else.

You can't statically assign every function a fixed chunk of memory, for two reasons.
**Recursion** (one function can be in progress many times at once, each instance needing
its own locals) and **waste** (a program with 10,000 functions would reserve scratch space
for all of them when only a handful are ever active).

## The insight

**Function lifetimes are strictly nested.** If `foo` calls `bar`, `bar` always finishes
before `foo` does. There is no way for `foo` to return while `bar` is still running.

That's a strong property. It means scratch space can be allocated and freed in **strict
LIFO order**, which means you don't need a memory allocator at all. You need **a pointer
that moves down when you enter a function and up when you leave.**

That pointer is `sp`. The region it moves through is the stack. That's the whole idea;
everything else is bookkeeping.

## What it costs

Allocating 32 bytes of locals:

```asm
sub sp, sp, #32
```

One instruction. Freeing them: one instruction. No free list, no search, no fragmentation.

This is why stack allocation is effectively free and heap allocation isn't. `malloc` has
to *search* for a suitable hole, because heap objects don't have nested lifetimes and can
be freed in any order. The stack skips all of that by exploiting a structural fact about
how function calls work.

## `sp` is a register that holds an address

That's all it is. A 64-bit CPU register whose value is a memory address: the "stack
pointer."

And **the stack is not a data structure the CPU knows about. It's just a region of RAM.**
The only thing that makes it a stack is that everyone agrees to treat it like one: `sp`
points at the current top, and the region grows **downward** into lower addresses.

Which is why the [linker script](linker-scripts.md) has to reserve a chunk of memory and
export `__stack_top`. There is nothing magic to allocate. We are picking a stretch of RAM
and declaring "this is the stack now."

## Stack frames, and why backtraces exist

One function's slice of the stack (its locals, its saved registers, its parked `x30`) is
a **stack frame**. The stack is a pile of them, one per function currently in progress.

Each frame also saves `x29`, the **frame pointer**, which points at the previous frame. So
the frames form a linked list running back down the call chain, and each one has a saved
`x30` sitting right next to it.

**That linked list is a stack trace.** Printing a backtrace means walking `x29` from frame
to frame, reading the saved `x30` out of each, and mapping those addresses to function
names. There is no magic table. The information was already lying in memory because of how
calls work.

## Stack overflow (and a thing we have to deal with)

`sp` moves down and **nothing checks it**. Recurse too deeply and `sp` walks off the
bottom of the reserved region into whatever memory is below.

In a normal program the OS puts an unmapped **guard page** just past the end of the stack,
so touching it raises a page fault and you get a clean crash. That is what "stack
overflow" *is*: you hit the guard page.

**We didn't have that when this was written**, and the paragraph is kept in its original tense
because the incident below happened while it was true. We had 64 KiB reserved in a linker script and
nothing below it but more of our own kernel, so blowing the stack silently overwrote `.bss`, then
`.data`, then `.text`, and then executed the corrupted result.

**We have it now.** Milestone 4 put an unmapped page below the boot stack once the MMU was on;
milestone 90 finished the job, so today the boot stack, every per-CPU secondary stack and every
kernel thread stack has one. See ["The overflows of 2026-08-14"](stack/overflows-2026-08-14.md) for what that
buys, what it does not, and the two real overflows that tested it.

# The milestone 3 incident

The paragraph above was written during milestone 1 as a hypothetical. It happened during
milestone 3. Recording it in full, because how it was *diagnosed* is more useful than the
bug.

## The symptom

A kernel test hung. Forever. Under a 150-second timeout, it never finished. No panic, no
fault, no output. The last thing printed was the name of the test.

## The bug

```rust
let mut taken = [None; 1024];        // [Option<Frame>; 1024] = 16 KiB
...
for frame in taken.into_iter().flatten() {
    memory::free(frame);
}
```

`into_iter()` on an array **moves it by value**. `flatten()` wraps the result in another
struct, which gets moved again. In a debug build (no optimization, nothing elided) those
copies are all real, and they all land on the stack:

```
  16 KiB   taken
+ 16 KiB   the array moved into core::array::IntoIter
+ 16 KiB   the IntoIter moved into Flatten
--------
  48 KiB   on a 64 KiB stack that already had frames on it
```

`sp` walked below `__stack_bottom`, through `.bss`, through `.data`, and into `.text`. The
kernel then executed its own overwritten code, and hung.

**`into_iter()` on a large array is a real kernel footgun.** Use `iter()` and borrow.

## Three wrong turns, and what actually worked

**Wrong turn 1: "it printed `sp=` and stopped, so it dies inside `println!`."** It didn't.
That was QEMU's *unflushed stdout buffer* being discarded when the timeout killed it. The
output we saw was simply the last thing that made it out of the buffer, not the last thing
that executed. **Never infer a hang location from where output stops** unless you know the
output is unbuffered.

**Wrong turn 2: "the stack is fine."** A probe measured `headroom()` right after declaring
the array and found plenty of room. True, and irrelevant: it measured *before* the three
copies that actually blew it. **A measurement is only as good as where you put it.**

**Wrong turn 3: diagnosing before bisecting.** Two hypotheses were argued from arithmetic
before anyone bisected. Both were wrong.

**What worked:** semihosting exit codes as markers.

```rust
memory::alloc_loop();
semihosting::exit(31);      // do we even get here?
memory::free_loop();
```

Exit code 31 came back. The alloc loop was fine; the free loop was the problem. That single
bit of information was worth more than all the theorizing, and it took two minutes.

**Why exit codes and not prints:** the failing kernel had corrupted `.text`, and
`println!` runs through `core::fmt`, which lives in `.text`. Using the broken thing to
diagnose the broken thing is circular. A semihosting exit is a single `hlt` instruction and
two register writes ([semihosting.md](semihosting.md)). It works when almost nothing else
does.

## What we added

A **canary**: four magic words at `__stack_bottom` (`kernel/src/stack.rs`), checked after
every test, and in the panic handler and the fault handler.

**And it did not catch this bug.** Be clear about that. The overflow destroyed `.text`
before any check could run, so there was no surviving code to notice. The canary catches
the *milder* case, where an overflow dips below the stack, corrupts `.bss`, and returns.
That is worth having, and the after-each-test check pins the blame on the test that did it
rather than on some later victim. But it is a mitigation, not a fix.

**The fix is the guard page at milestone 4.** An unmapped page below `__stack_bottom` means
the MMU faults on the *first* byte written past the end, before any damage. Precise, free
at runtime, impossible to miss. That is the whole reason `link-aarch64.ld` carries a TODO about it.

## `bl` does *not* push the return address (this is not x86)

On **x86**, `call` pushes the return address onto the stack.

On **aarch64**, `bl kernel_main` ("branch with link") puts the return address in a
**register**: `x30`, also called `lr` (link register). It never touches memory.

So a call with a garbage `sp` technically succeeds. The problem arrives one instruction
later, in the callee's prologue:

```asm
stp  x29, x30, [sp, #-32]!   ; save frame pointer + link register, sp -= 32
mov  x29, sp                 ; establish the frame pointer
...                          ; locals live at [sp, #16], etc.
ldp  x29, x30, [sp], #32     ; restore them, sp += 32
ret                          ; branch to whatever is in x30
```

A function needs the stack for two reasons:

1. Its **local variables** live there.
2. It must **spill `x30` to memory** before making any call of its own, because a nested
   `bl` overwrites `x30` and would destroy its own return address.

(Corollary: a *leaf* function with no locals touches the stack not at all, and would run
fine with a garbage `sp`. Don't rely on this.)

**With a garbage `sp`, the callee's first instruction stores registers to a random
address.** Which is worse than crashing, because it might not crash. It might quietly
corrupt something and fail ten thousand instructions later.

**Rule: set `sp` before calling any Rust function.**

## Two details that will bite you

**There is no `push` or `pop` instruction.** ARM removed them. You use `stp` / `ldp`
(store pair / load pair) with pre- and post-indexed addressing. That's what the `#-32]!`
and `], #32` above are doing; the `!` means "write the updated address back into `sp`."
It is push and pop, spelled out.

**`sp` must always be 16-byte aligned.** Not 8. Sixteen. A misaligned `sp` raises an
alignment fault when used. This is why the prologue above subtracts 32 and not 24. It is
a classic source of mysterious early-boot crashes.

## One stack pointer per exception level

aarch64 does not have one stack pointer. It has **`SP_EL0`, `SP_EL1`, `SP_EL2`,
`SP_EL3`** (see [exception levels](aarch64.md)).

Consider what that buys us. A userspace program at EL0 uses `SP_EL0` and can set it to
any garbage it likes, because it's the program's own stack and its own problem. When an
exception fires and the CPU enters EL1, **the hardware automatically switches to
`SP_EL1`**, the kernel's stack pointer, which userspace cannot touch.

So a malicious or broken user program **cannot** corrupt the kernel's stack by handing it
a bad `sp`. The hardware will not allow the two to be confused. That is not a convention
the kernel enforces. It is silicon.

This is the mechanism that makes milestone 7 (user mode) safe, and it's another place
aarch64's clean-sheet design visibly beats x86, where the equivalent is bolted together
out of the TSS and a privilege-change stack switch.

## The part that connects to everything else

**A thread is, essentially, a stack plus a set of register values.**

That is not a metaphor. It is what a thread *is* at the hardware level. Two threads
running concurrently means two independent chains of nested function calls in progress,
which means two separate stacks. There is no way around it.

This is why the async-vs-preemptive decision mattered so much (see
[DECISIONS](../design/decisions/05-preemptive-threads.md) §5). Async tasks are state machines the compiler builds on
the heap, which is why they don't each need a stack, which is why async looked cheaper.
But a real user program is not a state machine we built. It is arbitrary machine code with
an arbitrary call depth, and it needs a real stack.

So **milestone 6 (threads) is really**: allocate a stack per thread, and write assembly
that saves the current register set, swaps `sp`, and restores a different register set.
That is a context switch. It's about thirty instructions, and the stack is the thing being
switched.

# The incidents since, and where each is recorded

Milestone 3 (hand out physical memory, and detect a smashed stack) was the first overflow, not the
last. Each later incident has its own appendix, split out on 2026-09-25 (UTC) under §212 (a prose
budget), with every section heading kept, and [the directory's README](stack/README.md) marks the
names provisional. Two rules came out of them and hold today. A frame larger than the guard page
defeats the guard page, so `script/stack-frame-check` gates every frame at 4096 bytes and growing
the stack is not the fix. And nothing on an interrupt stack may context-switch away from it.

# BUGS

The two incident write-ups that carried a `BUGS` section keep it here, beside the page a reader acts on.

## The per-CPU interrupt stack (milestone 124)


- **An overflow whose first fault is the vector's own frame store still cascades.** The vector saves
  before any Rust can decide to switch, so this does not rescue a stack that is already past its
  guard; it makes reaching that state much less likely. The cascade is described under the
  [2026-08-15 section](stack/overflow-2026-08-15.md) and is unchanged.
- **The static bound is a lower bound**, for the reasons `script/stack-depth-check`'s own BUGS
  section gives: indirect calls and assembly frames are invisible to a call-graph walker. The
  trampoline's own 32 bytes (aarch64) and 16 (riscv64) are exactly such a frame, uncounted.
- **The debug assertion in `schedule()` is debug-only.** A release kernel relies on the static proof
  and on review. That is the right trade on the hottest path in the kernel, and it is an exception
  worth naming rather than assuming.
- **Nothing measures the interrupt stack on a release build.** The paint-and-scan instrument is
  `cfg(test)`, like every other stack's, so the number in the report is the test suite's depth and
  not the shell's or the board tour's.

## A kernel stack freed under its owner


- **The refusal is a race the caller can still see**, one context switch wide, and it is now a
  `NotPermitted`/`Err` rather than a corrupted kernel. Any caller that reclaims a region containing
  a just-dead thread must retry; `wait_for` is the in-tree idiom.
- **`Finished` and `Embryo` residents get the same guard and have never been observed to hit it.**
  The guard is on `on_cpu` rather than on `Dead` precisely so it does not depend on which state was
  the one that bit.
- **Nothing statically prevents the next out-of-band remover from forgetting `on_cpu`.** The guard
  is a condition in one function, which is rung two of AGENTS.md's ladder. Rung one would be a type
  that cannot name a still-standing thread, and this tree does not have one.
- **The riscv64 dumps have no symbolized `sepc`**, so the vector-walk confirmation in
  [kernel-stack-freed-under-its-owner.md](stack/kernel-stack-freed-under-its-owner.md) is aarch64's
  three dumps plus riscv64's address arithmetic. The mechanism is architecture-independent (it is in
  `sched.rs`) and the `on_cpu` guard is too, so parity holds by construction rather than by a second
  set of dumps.
