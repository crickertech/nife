# ASIDs: tagged address spaces

*(Milestone 15. The mechanism behind `crates/address_space_identifier` and the disappearance of the context-switch
TLB flush.)*

## The problem

The TLB caches translations. Two processes both have a `0x40_0000`, mapping different frames.
Until this milestone the TLB could not tell them apart, because every user mapping was *global*:
its entries matched under any address space. The only safe switch was `tlbi vmalle1is`, discard
every EL1 translation on every core, the kernel's included, and then re-walk everything from
cold. Correct, and the code said so honestly, and slow in exactly the way that matters on the
hot path of a microkernel: switches are what an IPC-heavy system does all day.

## The mechanism, in three parts

1. **The `nG` bit** (descriptor bit 11, "not-global"): a TLB entry made from an `nG` mapping is
   tagged with the ASID that was live during the walk, and matches lookups only under that same
   ASID. Every *user* constructor in `paging` now sets it. Kernel mappings stay global on
   purpose: the high half is identical for everyone, and tagging it would waste TLB entries
   re-caching the same kernel translation per process.
2. **The ASID rides in `TTBR0_EL1`'s top bits**, written together with the table root as one
   composed value (`mmu::ttbr0_value`). Installing an address space *is* installing its tag.
3. **Each address space owns one ASID for life** (`crates/address_space_identifier`): allocated at creation, freed
   at teardown after `tlbi aside1is` has destroyed every entry wearing it. That flush-then-free
   order is the whole reuse contract, stated at the drop site.

The switch itself now flushes nothing. The old space's entries stop *matching* instead of being
destroyed; come back to that process later and its translations may still be warm. Invalidation
survives at exactly two targeted points: revocation flushes by VA across all ASIDs (a shared
page leaving every space), and teardown flushes by ASID (a space leaving the world).

## Why allocation is a bitmap, not Linux's generation scheme

The roadmap sketched "generation/rollover", the Linux design: processes outnumber ASIDs there,
so exhaustion bumps a generation, mass-flushes once, and reassigns lazily. Milestone 14 changed
the arithmetic under that sketch: concurrent address spaces are bounded (`MAX_SPACES` = 160,
enforced by the revocation registry), below even the smallest hardware ASID space (8-bit: 256).
The exhaustion case the generation machinery guards is unreachable here, and machinery whose
hard path can never be exercised honestly is machinery that rots. So: one bitmap, ASID 0 born
reserved for the kernel (the "nobody is home" reserved table runs as ASID 0 forever), 255
numbers for at most 160 spaces. If `MAX_SPACES` ever outgrows 255, the first answer is 16-bit
ASIDs (one TCR bit plus an ID-register check), not a new algorithm.

## The same three parts on RISC-V, and what they cost there instead

Milestone 58 brought this to the second ISA, and every part of the mechanism above has a twin whose
*shape* differs enough to be worth naming.

1. **Non-global is the default**, not an opt-in. Sv39 has a `G` bit meaning global, where aarch64 has
   `nG` meaning the opposite, so a user mapping is tagged unless somebody says otherwise. The kernel
   half is `G`, for the same reason it is global on aarch64.
2. **The tag rides in `satp[59:44]`**, above the root PPN and below MODE, packed with no slack. One
   register holds mode, tag and root, which is why installing an address space is a single `csrw`.
3. **Teardown is not one instruction.** `sfence.vma` is local. Discharging an ASID machine-wide means
   an IPI to every other hart through SBI RFENCE and an acknowledgement, which is the whole of
   milestone 58 and is written up in notes/riscv-tlb-shootdown.md.

And one thing that is *not* a twin: RISC-V permits `satp.ASID` to be **zero bits wide** where aarch64
mandates eight. The paragraph above about 255 numbers being safely below the smallest hardware ASID
space is an aarch64 fact. RISC-V probes the width at boot and keeps flushing on every switch if the
machine cannot tell the numbers apart.

## What is proved, and what is witnessed

Three Kani harnesses in `crates/address_space_identifier` (`script/verify`), the frontier crate
notes/verification.md predicted:

| Harness | Property |
|---|---|
| `the_kernel_asid_is_never_allocated` | no reachable state hands out ASID 0: a user space can never share the kernel's tag |
| `two_live_asids_are_distinct` | two live allocations never alias, from any state (sharing a tag would let the TLB serve one process the other's memory) |
| `free_releases_exactly_its_own_asid` | free clears its own bit and nothing else |

The flush-before-reuse half of the contract is kernel-side and runs on hardware, so it is
*witnessed* rather than proved: `asid_tagging_keeps_address_spaces_apart_without_flushes` maps
the same VA to different bytes in two spaces, switches between them with no flush, and demands
each space read its own byte. If `nG` were missing, the tag were not in TTBR0, or two spaces
shared an ASID, that test reads the wrong byte. **It runs on both ISAs since milestone 58**; before
that it could not be ported honestly, because RISC-V's context switch flushed everything and the
twin would have passed for the wrong reason.

The *machine-wide* half has its own witness since then too. `an_asid_flush_reaches_the_other_cores`
caches a translation on another core, changes the mapping with no per-address invalidation at all,
calls `flush_asid`, and demands the other core see the change. It fails if the sweep stays local,
which on RISC-V it does without the SBI RFENCE, and it is the only test of aarch64's `tlbi aside1is`
broadcast.
