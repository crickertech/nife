# Vec, Box, String, BTreeMap

The four types the [heap](heap.md) gave back. Each solves a problem the stack cannot.

They all live in the **`alloc` crate**: the middle layer from [no-std.md](no-std.md), between
`core` (needs nothing) and `std` (needs an OS). `extern crate alloc;` pulls it in, and it only
works because we supplied a `#[global_allocator]`.

```
BTreeMap ─┐
String ───┤
Vec ──────┼──▶ #[global_allocator] ──▶ our heap ──▶ a MemoryRegion the ──▶ RAM
Box ──────┘                        (crates/user_heap)   program was granted
```

**Where that diagram was drawn matters, and it moved.** It was written when the *kernel* had a
heap, `crates/heap` and `crates/frames` under it. Milestone 14's thesis retired that: the kernel
allocates nothing after boot, `crates/heap` and `crates/slab` were deleted once nothing referenced
them ([heap.md](heap.md)'s banner), and `kernel/src/` has no `#[global_allocator]` at all today. So
the chain above is a **userspace** one. The allocator algorithm is `crates/user_heap`, the memory
under it is a `MemoryRegion` capability the program's parent granted, and a program nobody granted
one to has no heap rather than a smaller one. The frame allocator still exists, as
`crates/page_frames`, one level below anything a program can name.

## `Box<T>`: "this lives on the heap, and I own it"

The simplest, and the foundation for the rest.

```rust
let b = Box::new(42u64);
```

Allocates 8 bytes on the heap, moves the value in, hands you a pointer. Dropping it frees.
**`Box` is `malloc` + `free`, with the `free` proved by the compiler.**

`Box<T>` is exactly one pointer on the stack. Zero overhead.

Three reasons you need it:

**Recursive types cannot be sized.** This is infinite:

```rust
struct Node { value: u64, next: Node }     // size = 8 + (8 + (8 + ...
```

This is 16 bytes:

```rust
struct Node { value: u64, next: Option<Box<Node>> }
```

The indirection is what makes the size finite. Every linked list, tree, and graph in Rust
rests on it.

**Trait objects.** `Box<dyn Write>`: you don't know the concrete type, so you can't know its
size, so it must be behind a pointer.

**Large values you don't want on the stack.** `Box<[Option<Frame>; 1024]>` would have put the
16 KiB array on the heap, and the [milestone 3 incident](stack.md) would never have happened.

## `Vec<T>`: a growable array

Three fields on the stack (24 bytes). The elements are on the heap.

```
stack:            heap:
┌──────────┐      ┌────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐
│ ptr  ────┼─────▶│ 10 │ 20 │ 30 │    │    │    │
│ len   3  │      └────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┘
│ cap   6  │       used: 3               spare: 3
└──────────┘
```

`push` writes at `len` and increments. When `len == cap`, it **allocates a bigger buffer
(double), copies everything, and frees the old one.**

**The doubling is the whole trick.** Grow by one each time and N pushes cost O(N²) in copying.
Double each time and the copies are rare enough that the average cost per push is constant:
*amortized O(1)*.

Which is why our `vec_works` test (1000 pushes) is a real workout for the allocator: it
reallocates about ten times, and each one is an allocate, a copy, and a free through code we
wrote.

**`Vec` is why `MAX_REGIONS = 16` existed.** A fixed array must guess its maximum in advance
and fail if it guessed low. `memory.rs` still returns `TooManyRegions` on a machine with more
than 16 memory regions, purely because `Vec` didn't exist when it was written.

## `String`: growable, owned text

Literally a `Vec<u8>` with one extra promise: **the bytes are valid UTF-8.** Same three fields,
same doubling.

The distinction from `&str` is the same distinction as `Vec<T>` vs `&[T]`, and it is one of
the first walls people hit in Rust:

| | Owns the memory? | Can grow? | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `String` | **yes**: heap buffer, freed on drop | yes | ptr + len + capacity |
| `&str` | no: it is a **view** | no | ptr + len |

A `&str` can point at a literal in `.rodata`, into the middle of a `String`'s heap buffer, or
at bytes on the stack. It doesn't care and it doesn't own.

**That's why `&str` works in `no_std` and `String` doesn't: a view needs no allocator.**

`format!` builds a `String`, which is why it only started working at milestone 4.

## `BTreeMap<K, V>`: an ordered map

A **B-tree**: a balanced search tree where each node holds *many* keys, not one.

### Why not `HashMap`?

**`HashMap` is not in `alloc`. It is `std`-only.**

It needs a randomly-seeded hasher (to resist hash-collision denial-of-service attacks), and a
random seed needs entropy from the operating system. **We are the operating system.**

So in a kernel you use `BTreeMap`, and it isn't a compromise: you also get ordered iteration
and range queries for free.

### Why a B-tree and not a binary search tree?

**Cache locality**, and it traces straight back to the memory hierarchy in
[registers.md](registers.md).

A binary tree node holds one key and two pointers. Every step down is a pointer chase, and
every pointer chase is potentially a **~200-cycle trip to RAM**. Twenty levels deep is twenty
cache misses.

Rust's `BTreeMap` packs **up to 11 keys per node**, laid out contiguously. One cache-line
fetch buys eleven comparisons. Far fewer memory round-trips for the same number of elements,
and memory round-trips are the only thing that matters.

Milestone 7 wants one: a process table mapping PID → process.

## What they share

Every one is **"owns some heap memory, frees it when dropped."** That's `Drop`, and it is what
makes the heap safe in Rust at all: the compiler proves the free happens exactly once, at the
right time. See the table in [heap.md](heap.md): use-after-free, double-free, and leaks are
*heap* problems, and ownership is the answer to all three.

| Type | On the stack | On the heap |
|---|---|---|
| `Box<T>` | 8 bytes (a pointer) | `size_of::<T>()` |
| `Vec<T>` | 24 bytes (ptr, len, cap) | `cap × size_of::<T>()` |
| `String` | 24 bytes (same) | `cap` bytes of UTF-8 |
| `BTreeMap` | a couple of words | the nodes |

## The rest of what `alloc` gave us

All verified working in the kernel, not assumed:

| | What it is | When we want it |
|---|---|---|
| `VecDeque<T>` | ring buffer / double-ended queue | **M5** UART receive queue, **M6** run queue |
| `BinaryHeap<T>` | priority queue | **M5** timer wheel: "wake me at T", earliest first |
| `Arc<T>` | shared ownership, **atomically** refcounted | **M7** `Arc<AddressSpace>`, `Arc<File>` |
| `Rc<T>` | shared ownership, **not** thread-safe | never, in a kernel. See below. |
| `BTreeSet<T>` | ordered set | |
| `Cow<T>` | clone-on-write | |
| `LinkedList<T>` | doubly linked list | almost never: cache-hostile, same argument as the B-tree above |
| `[T]::sort()` | stable sort | it needs a **temporary buffer**, which is why it lives in `alloc` and not `core` |

**`Arc` is the answer to "who frees this?" when the answer is "the last one out."** Milestone
7 wants it badly: multiple threads in a process share one address space and one set of file
descriptors.

## The trap: VecDeque allocates, and interrupt handlers must not

`VecDeque::push_back` **can allocate**. If the buffer is full it grows: allocate, copy, free.

Which collides head-on with [DECISIONS](../design/decisions/09-irq-safe-locking.md) §9:

> **Interrupt handlers do not allocate.**

A UART receive handler pushing into a `VecDeque` would take the heap lock **in interrupt
context**, and that is exactly the deadlock in [locking.md](locking.md).

**So milestone 5 needs a fixed-capacity ring buffer that never allocates.** Either we write one
(~40 lines, pure logic, host-testable) or we pull in `heapless`, which is a crate of exactly
these: compile-time capacity, no allocator at all.

Leaning toward writing it: a single-producer/single-consumer lock-free ring is genuinely
instructive, and it is the one place where the weak-memory-ordering material in
[portability.md](portability.md) stops being theoretical.

## `Rc` vs `Arc`: the difference is a use-after-free

`Rc` increments its refcount with a **plain, non-atomic** `count += 1`: a read, an add, a
write.

Two cores do that simultaneously. Both read 1. Both write 2. **An increment is lost.** The
count says 2 while three things hold the value, the last two drops take it to zero, and memory
that is still in use gets freed.

An interrupt handler does it too, on **one** core: the interrupted code is halfway through the
read-modify-write when the handler runs and does its own.

Rust catches this: `Rc` is `!Send`, so the compiler refuses to move it across threads. But
knowing *why* matters, because the compiler's protection ends at the boundary of what it can
see, and a kernel spends a great deal of time outside that boundary.

`Arc` uses an **atomic** read-modify-write. On our Cortex-A72 (ARMv8.0, no LSE) that is an
`LDXR`/`STXR` retry loop rather than a single `CAS`, which is precisely the cliff
[design/fat-binaries.md](../design/fat-binaries.md) is about.

## What we still don't have, and the pattern in it

**Corrected 2026-09-05 (milestone 259), and the old column is kept because the rate is the point.**
This table was written when none of these services existed, said "every gap is a milestone", and
was then not reread for the six weeks in which five of its six rows were built. The `Then` column
is what it claimed; `Now` is what `script/test` runs.

| | Then | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `HashMap` | "needs a randomly-seeded hasher; a seed needs OS entropy" | **Works.** Entropy is a capability (milestone 56, [entropy.md](entropy.md)). Granted, the seed is real; ungranted, std's PAL falls back to a splitmix64 stream over the counter **and labels it**, which is the §42 rule about not inventing a value silently |
| `Mutex`, `RwLock` | "these **block**, and blocking needs a scheduler to block *on*" | **Compile and work uncontended**, because a process is still one thread. `Condvar::wait` and `Once::wait` are the two that genuinely have no answer and end the process; see [std.md](std.md)'s abort census |
| `thread::spawn` | "needs a scheduler / M6" | **Still `Unsupported`, and this is the one row that held.** The scheduler arrived at milestone 6; what is missing is a decision, not a service. See [thread-spawn-fork.md](thread-spawn-fork.md) |
| `Instant`, `SystemTime` | "needs a clock / M5" | **Both real.** `Instant` is the virtual counter; `SystemTime` is a clock page a granted program maps read-only (milestone 51, [clock.md](clock.md)) |
| `File`, `Path`, `fs` | "needs a filesystem / M8" | **Real and writable.** RedoxFS confined as a userspace server (milestone 32, [fs-server.md](fs-server.md)), bound into `std::fs` by milestone 27 phase two; `std::fs::write` works |
| `TcpStream` | "needs a network stack / out of scope" | **Bound, and it was never out of scope.** smoltcp in a confined net server (milestone 30, [net.md](net.md)); `TcpStream`, `TcpListener` and outbound `UdpSocket` all speak the socket contract |

**The third column's claim survived and the rows under it did not**, which is the useful half.
Everything `std` had that we lacked, we lacked because it needed a kernel service nobody had built,
and every one of those gaps did turn out to be a milestone. What the table got wrong was tense: it
described a floor as though it were a ceiling. The honest current map of the `std` surface is
[std.md](std.md), which is derived from what the compiler actually built rather than written once.

(`core::time::Duration` already exists, incidentally: it is arithmetic on nanoseconds and needs
nothing. It is `Instant` that needs hardware, because `Instant` means **now**, and nothing in
`core` knows what time it is.)
