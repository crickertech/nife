# QEMU

## What it is

QEMU is a computer made of software. It simulates a whole machine: a CPU that fetches
and executes real instructions one at a time, some RAM, and a set of devices.

We need it because **the kernel is not a program that runs on macOS**. It has no OS
underneath it, because it *is* the OS. It expects to be the first thing running on a
machine, to own all of RAM, and to talk to hardware by writing values to specific
physical memory addresses. There is no `main()` for macOS to call, no `malloc`, no files.
You cannot type `./kernel` and have anything sensible happen.

So the kernel needs a computer. QEMU is that computer. It loads the kernel binary into
simulated memory, points the simulated CPU at the first instruction, and lets go. From
the kernel's point of view it has woken up on bare metal and is alone in the universe.
It cannot tell the difference.

## Why not develop on a real Raspberry Pi

Eventually we will (that's a planned milestone). But compare the loops:

| | Real hardware | QEMU |
|---|---|---|
| Iteration | Build, copy to SD card, move card, power-cycle, watch a serial cable | `cargo run`, ~1 second |
| Debugger | Needs special JTAG hardware | Built in (GDB stub) |
| Automated tests | Basically impossible | It's just a process with an exit code |
| Cost of a bug | Reflash the card | Press up-arrow |

## The `virt` machine

`-M virt` tells QEMU which computer to pretend to be. It can imitate many real boards,
including a Raspberry Pi. But `virt` is a machine that **does not physically exist**. The
QEMU developers invented it as a deliberately clean, well-documented, standards-following
ARM board.

Real hardware is full of quirks, undocumented registers, and errata. `virt` has a serial
port at exactly `0x0900_0000`, a standard ARM interrupt controller, and virtio devices,
all at fixed documented addresses. Nothing is weird. It is the machine you would design
if your goal was for a person to be able to learn on it.

That is exactly why we start here and treat the Pi as a later port. The Pi will teach us
what real hardware is like. `virt` lets us learn what a kernel is first, without the two
lessons tangled together.

## The serial port

The kernel's first output device is a serial port: ancient, and beautifully dumb. Write a
byte to a magic memory address and that byte goes out a wire, one bit at a time. No
graphics, no fonts, no buffering. It is the simplest way a computer can say anything at
all, which is why it is the first thing every kernel learns to do.

QEMU wires the simulated serial port straight to your terminal. When the kernel writes a
byte to `0x0900_0000`, a character appears in your shell.

## Flags we use, and why

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-M virt` | Be the fictional clean ARM board (above) |
| `-cpu cortex-a72` | Pretend to be this specific ARM core (the one in a Pi 4) |
| `-nographic` | No emulated display window. Wire the serial port to this terminal |
| `-semihosting` | Let the guest ask the host to do things, e.g. "exit with code 0". This is how our test harness reports pass/fail |
| `-kernel <file>` | Load this ELF and jump to its entry point |
| `-s -S` | Open a GDB stub on port 1234 and freeze the CPU until a debugger attaches |

## Emulation vs. virtualization

QEMU *emulates* by default: it reads each guest instruction and simulates its effect in
software. Slower, but it can pretend to be hardware you don't own, and it can stop the
world for a debugger.

A VM product (Parallels, VMware) *virtualizes*: guest instructions run natively on the
real CPU with hardware assist. Much faster, but the guest must match the host
architecture. QEMU can do this too (via KVM on Linux, HVF on macOS), but we don't need
the speed and we do want the debuggability.

## Three ways QEMU will burn your laptop

All three bit us for real. The first two cost 729% of CPU over one day of development. The
third cost milestone 127's EL2 lane time twice in one session, and caught another lane again on
2026-09-02, which is what minted milestone 226.

### 1. An idle kernel is not idle

`arch::halt()` is `loop { wfi }`. It **was** `loop { wfe }`, and the difference is enormous:

| Instruction | Waits for | What QEMU does | Host CPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wfe` | an **event** (an `sev` from another core, a lock release) | treats it as a hint and keeps executing the loop | **99.7%** |
| `wfi` | an **interrupt** | halts the vCPU; **the host thread sleeps** | **0.0%** |

A halted kernel using `wfe` pins a host core forever. Use `wfi` for idling. It is also the
semantically correct instruction: we are not waiting for a sibling core to signal us, we are
idling until something interrupts us.

### 2. QEMU swallows SIGALRM

The obvious way to bound a run on macOS (which has no `timeout(1)`) is:

```sh
perl -e 'alarm 10; exec @ARGV' qemu-system-aarch64 ...     # DOES NOT WORK
```

**QEMU installs its own `SIGALRM` handler** (it uses timers internally), so the alarm is
swallowed and the process runs forever. Every "bounded" run leaks a QEMU.

QEMU *does* honour **SIGTERM**. Use `scripts/qemu-bounded.sh <seconds> <cmd...>`, which
starts a detached killer that survives a pipeline whose reader (`head`) exits early. That
last part matters: `qemu ... | head -20` leaves QEMU alive, because `head` closing the pipe
does not kill a process that has stopped writing.

### 3. The bound is not the only way a run ends

Found by milestone 127's EL2 lane, twice in one session, and fixed by milestone 226.

The killer above used to have exactly one reason to fire, which was the bound expiring. That
bounds a run which is allowed to finish. It does nothing for a run whose **wrapper** is killed:
a dead session, a `pkill -f` at a harness, a closed terminal. The wrapper goes, **QEMU is
inherited by pid 1, and it runs forever.**

The bill arrives on a later run, in a different shape, which is what made it expensive. The
orphan holds the write lock on whatever disk image it was given, and the next boot fails with

```
qemu-system-aarch64: -device virtio-blk-device,drive=d0: Failed to get "write" lock
Is another process using the image [target/nifefs-blank.img]?
```

That names a **file**. Nothing in it points at a process, so it reads as a bug in whatever the
run was testing, and a lane that has read AGENTS.md's warning about leaked emulators can still
lose an hour to it because the symptom does not look like that warning.

`scripts/qemu-bounded.sh` now gives the killer two more reasons to fire. It **polls its parent**
once a second and kills the child as soon as the wrapper is gone, which covers a SIGKILLed
wrapper and a dead session, neither of which runs a trap anywhere. And it **traps SIGTERM and
SIGHUP**, so the one process that knows the child's pid does not take that knowledge with it
when `pkill -f` sweeps the wrapper and the killer together.

What is left, and it is not fixable on macOS: a **SIGKILL to the killer itself**. SIGKILL is not
trappable and macOS has no `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG)`, so a supervisor shot in the head cannot
hand off. For that case the script does the other thing instead of preventing it: when the
command fails, it runs `lsof` over the image paths in the command line and prints the pid, ppid,
start time and command of whoever holds one. **Walk the parent chain up before killing what it
names**: a QEMU whose parent is a live harness is somebody's gate in flight, not a leak.

`scripts/qemu-bounded-selftest.sh` checks all of this against a real emulator, including that
`perl`'s alarm is still swallowed. It is in no gate; run it if you touch the bounding script.

**A kernel does not exit.** That is the root of it: `cargo test` terminates because the test
build asks the host to exit via [semihosting](semihosting.md), but a normal boot halts
forever, by design, exactly like real hardware. So every interactive run must be bounded, and
`pgrep -x qemu-system-aarch64` is worth checking after a session.
