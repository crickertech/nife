# The dependency census: what 547 milestones actually stood on

**Measured 2026-09-22**, by four parallel lanes reading every milestone block in
`design/roadmap/` and classifying each reference to another milestone. The data is
`notes/dependency-census/dependencies.tsv`; this note is what it says and what it does not.

## Why it was taken

§207 (the roadmap is a graph, and the block says so in fields a script can walk) proposes that a milestone block declare its
dependencies in fields a script can walk. Before building that, calef asked the question that
decides whether it is worth building: *"I think we have not captured the dependencies well because we
create the dependent tasks after we've cleared the dependencies."*

He was right that the obvious measurement is the wrong one. Counting edges in the **ready** queue
counts a population selected for having no live dependencies. The finished work is where the graph
is observable, so the census reads all of it.

## What it found

| | |
|---|---|
| References classified | **3,381** (after removing 310 duplicates) |
| Of those, genuine prerequisites | **128** |
| Everything else | context, follow-on, or superseded |
| Dependency edges **declared** in `Gate:` fields | **15** |

**The headline is the ratio, not the rate.** 3.8% of references are prerequisites, which sounds like
a refutation and is not: **128 real edges against 15 declared ones is an eightfold
under-declaration.** The graph exists. It is thin, and it is almost entirely unstated.

## The shape is flat, and that is the useful result

No milestone is depended on by more than **five** others. The most-depended-on are 25, 55, 64, 74 and
218, all at five; the most dependent blocks carry four prerequisites each.

**There is no deep critical path.** This roadmap is wide rather than tall, which has a consequence
worth stating plainly: **the work is close to embarrassingly parallel, and dependencies are not what
bounds lane count.** Files and memory are, exactly as `AGENTS.md` already says. Ranking milestones by
depth in this graph would buy very little, because the depth is not there.

## When the dependency was known

Among prerequisite edges: **77 stated at creation, 50 added later.** So roughly 40% of the
dependencies this roadmap records were discovered while doing the work rather than while planning it.

**Read that number with care.** `git blame` records when a *sentence* was written, not when a
*dependency* was known. Milestone 76 backfilled the first day's history on 2026-08-03 in a single
sweep, so a large block of references date to that day regardless of when the relation was true. The
`discovery` column is therefore a lower bound on planning foresight and an upper bound on nothing.

## BUGS

- **The census can only see dependencies somebody wrote a sentence about.** A milestone that
  genuinely needed another, where nobody said so, is invisible here and always will be. This is the
  limit that matters: the census gives history and pattern, and **cannot** give a complete graph. It
  is why the forward convention in §207 is worth more than any backfill.
- **Classification was done by a cheap model and its precision is about 80%.** A twenty-row sample
  found sixteen genuine. Every failure had one cause: **negation**. Sentences reading *"Nothing gated
  this after milestone 107 merged"* and *"Independent of milestone 142's type-and-scanout work"* were
  filed as dependencies although both say the opposite. Five such rows were found mechanically and
  demoted, and they carry `RECLASSIFIED-NEGATION:` in the evidence column. More certainly remain.
- **The four shards disagreed with each other**, returning prerequisite rates of 7.0%, 3.3%, 1.9% and
  2.5% on adjacent milestone ranges from an identical brief. Treat any per-shard figure as noise and
  only the pooled number as meaningful.
- **`discovery` is `UNKNOWN` for 77 rows** in one shard, where `git blame` output could not be parsed
  because of non-standard author name formats.
- **Ten milestone files reference nothing at all**, and three more could not be dated because
  `--diff-filter=A` finds no creation record for a renamed file. `--follow` would fix the latter and
  the brief did not ask for it.
