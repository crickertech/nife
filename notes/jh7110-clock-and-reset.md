# Programming a clock and a reset line, for the first time

Milestone 220. `crates/jh7110_crg` (the offsets, the plan, the device-tree query),
`kernel/src/drivers/jh7110_crg.rs` (the stores), `kernel/src/user/entropy_service.rs` (the caller).

**This has never run against silicon.** QEMU's riscv64 `virt` machine has no clock or reset
controller of any kind, so an emulator cannot validate the sequence end to end: what CI exercises
is the absence path and the arithmetic. The bench procedure below is the part that would settle it,
and it is written to be followed rather than interpreted, the way `notes/x86-uefi-boot.md`'s is,
because the lane that wrote it could not reach the machine either.

## Why nife needed this at all

Every device this kernel has driven came up already running. QEMU's virtio devices are software.
The PL011 and NS16550 consoles are already clocked when firmware hands over. The PLIC is part of
the core complex. So nothing in this tree had ever programmed a clock, and nothing knew it needed
to.

Real `SoC` peripherals are not like that. Most of the JH7110's blocks boot gated, and the firmware
ungates only what the firmware itself uses. A gated block's register window is not absent, which is
the part that makes this hard to diagnose: it accepts every store and reads back zero.

**This was a prediction until 2026-09-04, and then it was a measurement.** Two boots of radon,
byte-identical:

```text
hw entropy  : FAILED: JH7110 TRNG at 0x1600c000 (tree says starfive,trng, status disabled):
              report 0x524e475550, bring-up diagnostic 0x0000000000000000,
              draws 0/0 bytes, first-all-zero true, draws-differ false
```

Transcript: `target/board/radon-2026-09-04-trng-bringup.log`. The diagnostic is the raw
`(STAT << 32) | ISTAT`, so the whole register file read back as zeros, and the vendor device tree
independently marks the node `status disabled`. Milestone 239 deliberately *reports* that `status`
without acting on it (the same tree calls the S7 core `okay` and gives it an MMU it does not have),
so the agreement between the tree and the hardware is corroboration rather than circularity.

## What the TRNG needs, from two trees that agree

Linux's `jh7110-trng.c` takes two clocks and a reset before it touches a register, in this order:

```c
trng->hclk = devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, "hclk");
trng->ahb  = devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, "ahb");
trng->rst  = devm_reset_control_get_shared(&pdev->dev, NULL);
clk_prepare_enable(trng->hclk);
clk_prepare_enable(trng->ahb);
reset_control_deassert(trng->rst);
```

**The order is load-bearing**, and Linux's own reset driver says why in a comment: *"if the
associated clock is gated, deasserting might otherwise hang forever"*. `TRNG_BRING_UP` reproduces
it and a host test pins it, because a plan that deasserted first would wedge a boot on hardware and
pass every test an emulator can run.

The identifiers are the interesting part, because **radon does not run mainline's device tree**. It
runs the vendor U-Boot's, which spells everything differently and numbers its clocks and resets
flat across all five domains rather than per domain. Both were fetched on 2026-09-04 and they
converge:

| | mainline Linux | vendor U-Boot (what radon serves) | resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| node | `rng@1600c000`, `starfive,jh7110-trng` | `trng@1600C000`, `starfive,trng`, `status = "disabled"` | (not this table's subject) |
| controller | `stgcrg`, `starfive,jh7110-stgcrg` | `clkgen`, `starfive,jh7110-clkgen`, `reg-names = "sys", "stg", "aon"` | `0x1023_0000`, size `0x1_0000` |
| clock 1 | `JH7110_STGCLK_SEC_AHB` = 15 | `JH7110_SEC_HCLK` = 205, stg group starts at 190 | **index 15**, word at `0x3c` |
| clock 2 | `JH7110_STGCLK_SEC_MISC_AHB` = 16 | `JH7110_SEC_MISCAHB_CLK` = 206 | **index 16**, word at `0x40` |
| reset | `JH7110_STGRST_SEC_AHB` = 3 | `RSTN_U0_SEC_TOP_HRESETN` = 131, stg group starts at 128 | **id 3**, bit 3 of `0x74`, watched at `0x78` |

The rebase arithmetic is a host test (`the_two_trees_agree_on_the_identifiers`) rather than a
paragraph, so a renumbering upstream fails the build instead of surprising somebody at the bench.
Every URL and fetch date is in `crates/jh7110_crg/src/lib.rs`'s header.

**Two mechanics worth knowing**, both transcribed rather than inferred:

- A clock is **one 32-bit word per index**, at `base + 4 * index`, and bit 31 turns it on
  (`JH71X0_CLK_ENABLE`).
- A reset's **status bit is inverted from what the name suggests**: a *set* bit means the line is
  out of reset. Linux's `jh71x0_reset_update` computes `done = mask` for a deassert (the JH7110
  passes `asserted = NULL`) and polls until `(value & mask) == done`. Getting this backwards
  produces a driver that waits forever on a device that came up correctly, which is why
  `jh7110_crg::deasserted` exists as one function with one test rather than as an expression at two
  call sites.

## Where it lives, and who may drive it

**The kernel does it, at wiring time, and no userspace program holds the controller.** That is an
exception to this project's standing direction of travel, so it owes an argument. DECISIONS §86
(whether an NVMe driver can leave the kernel, and what capability would let it) states that
direction in one line, *"the microkernel thesis that drivers are user programs"*, and cites §21
(the terminal is a userspace component, and the kernel is out of the shell business) and §23
(multi-queue DMA confinement: the validator's second direction) as the work already spent moving
components out. The argument here is §86's own, reused rather than reinvented: **the kernel keeps
the admin plane, EL0 gets the data path, and no new syscall surface is added.**

Three things make the clock controller a stronger case for that split than NVMe was:

- **Granting it would *widen* a driver's authority, not confine it.** The STG window is one 64 KiB
  block holding the clocks and resets for USB, both PCIe root ports, the DMA engine and the
  security block. Milestone 159's whole demonstration is a driver holding *one page of one
  device's registers and two endpoints*; handing it the CRG would trade the narrowest authority in
  this tree for the widest. The reset in question is even documented as **shared** upstream
  (`devm_reset_control_get_shared`): the same line resets the PL080 DMA at `0x1600_8000`, which is
  why nothing in this crate offers an *assert* at all.
- **It is one-shot setup, entirely off any hot path.** The performance argument that makes EL0
  attractive for NVMe's data path does not exist for three register writes at boot.
- **It costs zero new syscall surface**, which §86 called the reversible part of its own decision.
  `start_jh7110` already maps the device page and spawns; this adds three stores before it. If a
  later milestone wants a clock service at EL0 (a power-management story would want one), that is
  a decision taken on its own evidence, and this forecloses none of it.

### The one genuinely dangerous thing here, and what stops it

`jh7110_crg::discover` **never fails to produce an address**. A tree that names no controller gets
`STG_BASE` (`0x1023_0000`) with `from_tree: false`. That is deliberate: radon's firmware tree is
already known to omit and misdescribe things, and a bench session that comes back with "no
controller node, nothing attempted" has spent a trip to the machine and learned nothing. Two
independently published trees agree on the number, which is a stronger warrant than most
device-tree reads get.

But a caller that took that answer unconditionally would store to `0x1023_0000` on **every board
this kernel boots**, and on QEMU's `virt` that address is unmapped. So the guard is one rung up
from a comment:

- `memory::init` records the window **only when the tree names a JH7110** (a clock controller, or
  the TRNG whose clocks this exists to ungate). QEMU's `virt` names neither.
- `mmu::map_everything` maps only what `memory::jh7110_crg()` returned, so on any other machine
  there is no mapping to store through.
- `no_clock_window_is_mapped_where_there_is_no_jh7110` (`kernel/src/user/entropy_tests.rs`) pins
  it, because the failure is silent in the direction that matters: a load or store fault during
  boot on a machine nobody would think to blame a clock driver for.
- The boot tour **prints which source the address came from**, in words, so a transcript can never
  be read as confirmation of an address nobody on that machine confirmed.

## The bench: bringing the TRNG's clocks up on radon

**This has not been done.** radon was powered off and there was no bench session when this was
written.

### What you need

Everything `notes/visionfive2.md`'s bench runbook already lists: the card, the DIP switches on
QSPI, the serial chain, and USB-C power. Nothing new. Milestone 224's smart plug is plug 2; **plug
3 is garcia and must never be switched off.**

### Build and copy

```console
$ cd /path/to/nife
$ script/board-image --card /Volumes/NIFE
$ diskutil eject /Volumes/NIFE
```

The archive must be the matched set: the kernel measures it, and a mismatched pair halts with
`MEASURED BOOT REFUSED` rather than booting something ambiguous.

### Watch it

```console
$ ls /dev/cu.usbmodem*
$ script/board-console --for 5m
```

### What you should see, in order

The boot proceeds exactly as `notes/visionfive2.md` records, up to the tour. Two lines are the
whole of this milestone, and **the clock line now comes first**:

```text
  hw clock    : JH7110 STG CRG at 0x10230000 (named by this machine's device tree):
                clocks 0x00000000,0x00000000 -> 0x80000000,0x80000000 (running);
                reset 3 assert 0x00000008 -> 0x00000000, status 0x00000008 (released, 3 polls)
  hw entropy  : JH7110 TRNG at 0x1600c000 served 32+32 bytes to a client through a capability
                that names no device; first draw 8f3a1c04.., second differs
```

(wrapped here; each is one line on the wire).

### What each outcome means

Read the **clock** line first: it decides how the entropy line should be read.

| The `hw clock` line says | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `skipped` / `no JH7110 clock-and-reset window was mapped` | Neither a clock controller nor a TRNG in this tree. On radon this is a regression in discovery, not a fact about the board | Dump the tree at the U-Boot prompt (`fdt addr $fdtcontroladdr; fdt list /soc`) and check what the controller node is actually called. Milestone 239 is the precedent: the node name was `trng@1600C000` with an upper-case C |
| `NOT named by this machine's tree: the constant...` | The TRNG node was found but no clock controller was, so the address came from the constant | The bring-up still ran and the rest of the line is real. Capture `fdt list /soc` and add the node's real compatible to `jh7110_crg`'s discovery list, so the next boot reads it rather than assuming it |
| clocks `-> 0x80000000,0x80000000 (running)`, reset `released` | **The sequence worked.** Bit 31 read back on both clocks and the status bit came up | Read the `hw entropy` line, below |
| clocks `(NOT running: the enable bit did not read back...)` | The enable bit did not stick. The window is device-mapped and accepting stores, and nothing is behind it | The base address is wrong, or the STG domain itself is gated by a parent this milestone does not program. See BUGS: the SYSCRG `stg_axiahb` parent is the first suspect |
| reset `STILL HELD` after `1000000` polls | The clocks came up and the reset did not release. Linux's own comment says a gated clock is the usual cause of exactly this hang, so a `running` verdict beside it is contradictory and interesting | Capture the whole line. This is the outcome that most wants a register dump before anyone changes code |
| `; the firmware had already done all of this` | **The premise was wrong.** The clocks were on and the reset released before nife touched anything | Then a gated clock is *not* why the TRNG read zeros, and milestone 220 does not explain the 2026-09-04 transcript. The next suspect is the base address or the `reg` decode, which is milestone 159's territory again |

Then the **entropy** line:

| The `hw entropy` line says | What it means |
|---|---|
| `served 32+32 bytes ... second differs` | **Fatal risk 6's "drives real hardware" half is closed**, and it was closed by a confined EL0 driver holding one device page |
| `FAILED ... bring-up diagnostic 0x0000000000000000` **with** a `running`/`released` clock line | The window still reads as nothing, with its clocks demonstrably on. That is a new fact, and it is not this milestone's | 
| `FAILED` with a non-zero diagnostic | The device answered and the driver's sequence is wrong. That is milestone 159's, and it is the outcome 159's block was written to route |
| `FAILED` with the clock line reporting `NOT running` | One cause, two symptoms. Fix the clock line first; the entropy line carries no independent information until it is |

### If it works

Record the transcript under `target/board/` with the date in the filename, the way
`radon-2026-09-04-trng-bringup.log` is, and say in the roadmap block which boot it was. The line
this milestone exists to produce is a *measurement*, and a measurement nobody can find is a claim.

## BUGS

- **None of this has run on hardware.** Every register offset, bit position and identifier is
  transcribed from published source; the only thing proven is that the two published trees agree
  with each other and that the arithmetic is right. An emulator cannot do better here, because
  QEMU's `virt` machine has no clock or reset controller to model.
- **Only the STG domain, and within it only the two clocks and one reset the TRNG needs.** The
  JH7110 has five domains (`syscrg`, `stgcrg`, `aoncrg`, `ispcrg`, `voutcrg`) and hundreds of
  clocks. The milestone's own block named unbounded scope as its main risk; this is the small end
  of it, with the arithmetic general enough that a second domain is a table entry rather than a
  rewrite.
- **Parent clocks are not programmed, and this is the first thing to suspect if the enable bits do
  not read back.** The STG domain's own bus clock (`stg_axiahb`) comes from the SYSCRG at
  `0x1302_0000`, and nothing here touches it. Linux gets away with the same narrow sequence because
  its clock framework walks parents automatically; this does not, and relies on the firmware
  having left the bus clocks running, which is plausible (U-Boot uses the STG domain for USB and
  PCIe) and unverified.
- **The deassert poll is an iteration count, not a duration.** Linux uses a 1000 µs timeout;
  `POLL_LIMIT` counts a million reads instead, because this runs before there is a calibrated delay
  to hand. A million MMIO reads is far longer than the microsecond the hardware needs and far
  shorter than a boot anyone would call hung, but it is not a time bound and a slower board would
  scale it silently.
- **Nothing here can turn a clock off or assert a reset**, deliberately. Gating a clock or
  asserting a shared reset would stop or interrupt a neighbour mid-transaction, and no caller in
  this tree has a reason to. It also means there is no teardown: a service that dies leaves its
  device clocked. That is the right trade today (nothing reclaims device power) and it is the piece
  a power-management milestone would have to add.
- **`Report` records only the first four clock steps.** A longer plan still performs every step;
  the recording stops and `truncated` says so. Nothing in the tree has a plan that long.
- **The vendor `rstgen` node is tried and has never been exercised by a fixture.** Its
  `reg-names` spelling (`"stgcrg"`, not `"stg"`) is transcribed from the vendor tree and is only
  reached by a tree carrying a reset controller and no clock controller, which no tree here has.
