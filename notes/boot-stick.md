# The boot stick, and the program that makes it

DECISIONS §157, as amended on 2026-09-19: a trivial install starts from **one downloaded program per
host operating system**, with the boot payload inside it, which writes a bootable stick when run;
it is **not signed**; and **from any machine it builds a boot for any other machine**. This note is
how that was built, what it was proved on, and what it was not. The roadmap block is
`design/roadmap/441-the-program-that-makes-the-stick.md` (number provisional).

## In one paragraph

`cargo xtask stick` builds three UEFI boot files, one per architecture, and a program called
`stick_maker` (name provisional) that carries all three. Run on a Mac, a Linux PC or a Windows PC,
the program lists the USB sticks and SD cards on the machine, asks which, and writes the three
files to `\EFI\BOOT\` on it. Each machine's firmware finds the file with its own architecture's name
and ignores the other two, so the one stick boots an x86_64 PC, an aarch64 board and a riscv64
board, and nobody picks a target. Under QEMU, the stick the program writes boots all three
architectures to the userspace progenitor. On real hardware it has booted nothing yet.

## Using it

```console
$ cargo xtask stick                        # the three boot files, then stick_maker for this Mac
$ target/stick-maker/stick_maker-macos-arm64
nife stick maker, build 0d4399c98566
  aarch64  EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI    16.0 MB
  riscv64  EFI/BOOT/BOOTRISCV64.EFI 14.4 MB
  x86_64   EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI     10.2 MB

Removable disks:
  1) disk8    SanDisk Ultra                  30.8 GB  USB            FAT "UNTITLED"
Which one? (1-1, or Enter to stop) 1
Will copy 40.6 MB of boot files to /Volumes/UNTITLED on disk8 (SanDisk Ultra). Nothing on it is erased.
Type y to copy: y
  wrote /Volumes/UNTITLED/EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI (16.0 MB)
  ...
Ejected disk8; it can be pulled out.
```

(The listing above is the program's real output shape; the disk in it is the synthesized stick of
the test fixtures, because no flash stick was attached while this was written. See BUGS.)

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--list [--all]` | Show what would be offered; `--all` adds every disk that is not, with the reason |
| `--disk ID --yes` | No questions: copy onto that disk's FAT volume, never erasing |
| `--disk ID --erase` | No questions: erase that disk if it is not FAT, then copy |
| `--keep-mounted` | Do not eject afterwards |
| `--include-disk-images` | Also offer file-backed disks, which is how every test here runs |

What it leaves on the stick besides the boot files is `NIFE.TXT`: which build, and the SHA-256 of
each file. That retires, in part, `notes/x86-uefi-boot.md`'s BUGS entry *a stale `.efi` on a stick is
silent*: the stick now says what it carries, in a file any computer can open.

## Which disks it will touch, and the measurement that decided it

**A disk is offered only when its media is removable**: the SCSI removable-media bit that a USB
flash stick or an SD card reader sets. macOS reports it as `RemovableMedia`, Linux as
`/sys/block/<dev>/removable` (and an SD card's `device/type` of `SD`), Windows as `DRIVE_REMOVABLE`.
One rule, `crates/stick_maker/src/disk.rs`'s `refusal`, tested once.

**How the program is laid out, and why it matters for trusting it.** Every decision is in a file
the tests reach: the rule (`disk.rs`), what each host's tools say (`macos.rs`, `linux.rs`,
`windows.rs`, read from captured output), and the whole conversation with the person (`cli.rs`, run
against a fake host). `src/host/` only runs the tools, and is exempt from `script/coverage`'s floor
with the reason recorded there: the coverage run cannot execute `diskutil` or erase a disk. It is
run for real on each host instead, by `scripts/stick-maker-proof.sh` and the CI workflow.

The obvious rule was "external, on USB", and the machine this was written on refutes it. It has two
USB hard disks attached, a 2 TB Seagate Portable and a 3 TB WD My Book, one holding backups:

```console
$ target/stick-maker/stick_maker-macos-arm64 --list --all
  disk4    Seagate Portable                2.0 TB  USB            FAT "EFI", unrecognised
           not offered: not removable media (a USB hard disk or SSD, which is where backups live)
  disk6    WD My Book 1140                 3.0 TB  USB            FAT "EFI", Journaled HFS+ "..."
           not offered: not removable media (a USB hard disk or SSD, which is where backups live)
```

Both report `Internal = false` and `BusProtocol = USB`. Both report `RemovableMedia = false`. A rule
keyed on the bus would have offered a backup disk for erasing. The documents `diskutil` printed for
them are the test fixtures (`crates/stick_maker/tests/fixtures/macos/`), trimmed and with volume
names scrubbed, so the test that proves a backup disk is never offered runs against the real thing.

Three more refusals stand behind that one: a disk the host calls internal, a disk with a volume
mounted where the running system lives, and a file-backed disk unless asked for.

## Copy first, erase only when needed

| Path | When | What happens | Administrator rights |
|---|---|---|---|
| Copy | A mounted FAT volume with room | Files written under `EFI/BOOT/`, nothing erased | No |
| Erase | Anything else (exFAT, NTFS, APFS, no volume) | One FAT32 partition, MBR, then the copy | macOS no; Linux `sudo`; Windows not automated |

Each file is written to a temporary name, flushed, renamed over the old one and read back, so a stick
pulled out mid-write holds last time's file or this time's, never half of one.

**Erasing uses each host's own tool**, not a FAT32 writer in this tree: `diskutil eraseDisk` on
macOS, `sfdisk` and `mkfs.vfat` on Linux. The reason is not effort. A tree-written formatter would
mean this program opening a raw block device and writing to it, which is the most dangerous thing it
could do and the thing the OS tools already refuse to do to a mounted system disk. The cost is
stated: Linux needs `dosfstools`, which some minimal installs lack, and the program says which
package to install.

**MBR, not GPT**, measured rather than preferred: `diskutil eraseDisk ... GPT` writes a 200 MB `EFI`
partition ahead of the data one (disk4 and disk6 above both have that layout), so the stick would
carry two FAT volumes and a firmware that looks only at the first finds nothing. MBR gives one, and
U-Boot's distro boot and every UEFI implementation read it.

**Windows prints the `diskpart` steps instead of running them.** Automating it means mapping a drive
letter to a disk number and running destructive code on a host where it has never run once; that is
recorded in `crates/stick_maker/src/windows.rs`'s BUGS with what would promote it.

## The three boot files

| File | Built for | rustc target tier (read 2026-09-19) | Kernel entry contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BOOTX64.EFI` | `x86_64-unknown-uefi` | Tier 2, no host tools | PVH (`notes/x86-uefi-boot.md`) |
| `BOOTAA64.EFI` | `aarch64-unknown-uefi` | Tier 2, no host tools | arm64 `booti`: MMU off, `x0` = device tree |
| `BOOTRISCV64.EFI` | `riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf`, converted | **no riscv64 UEFI target exists** | riscv `booti`: paging off, `a0` = hart, `a1` = device tree |

The tiers are from `rustc --print target-list` on the pinned nightly, which lists `aarch64-`,
`i686-` and `x86_64-unknown-uefi` and nothing for RISC-V, and from the platform-support page. So the
riscv64 loader is linked as a static position-independent ELF and `crates/portable_executable`
(provisional) turns it into PE/COFF: one section per segment, the ELF's 241 `R_RISCV_RELATIVE`
relocations turned into `IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64` fixups. It booted on its first run under EDK2.

All three are one loader source, `uefi_loader`, with the architecture-specific arms under
`uefi_loader/src/arch/`. The kernel is not modified on any architecture and cannot tell which loader
started it.

### How the device tree reaches the kernel on aarch64 and riscv64, measured

1. The loader finds the tree in the UEFI configuration table under `gFdtTableGuid`
   (`b1b621d5-f19c-41a5-830b-d9152c69aae0`, read from EDK2's `MdePkg.dec`).
2. It copies the tree below what the kernel's boot page tables reach (2 GiB on aarch64, 3 GiB on
   riscv64), adding `/chosen/linux,initrd-start` and `linux,initrd-end` for the archive it placed.
   That is `uefi_loader::device_tree_patch`, whose tests decode its output with the crate the kernel
   decodes with, so the two cannot disagree without a host test failing.
3. On riscv64 it also asks which hart it is, through `RISCV_EFI_BOOT_PROTOCOL` (GUID read from
   EDK2's `UefiCpuPkg.dec`), falling back to `/chosen/boot-hartid`, and prints which answered.
4. It exits boot services and enters the kernel with the tree's address in `x0` (aarch64, after
   cleaning the data cache to coherency and turning the MMU off) or `a1` (riscv64, after turning
   paging off).

What the kernels printed under EDK2, 2026-09-19:

```text
aarch64:  firmware handoff: 0x000000004cb41000  (device tree)
          initrd          : 10415616 bytes at 0x000000004ae3a000, a nifefs archive of 88 program(s)
          smp: 4 core(s) online
riscv64:  uefi_loader: boot hart from RISCV_EFI_BOOT_PROTOCOL: 0
          firmware handoff: 0x000000008dbad000  (device tree)
          initrd          : 7476736 bytes at 0x000000008dbaf000, a nifefs archive of 88 program(s)
          smp: 4 core(s) online                     (with NIFE_SMP=4)
```

**EDK2 on aarch64 hides the device tree when it presents ACPI**, measured 2026-09-19: under
`-machine virt` (ACPI on by default) the loader printed `the firmware offers no device tree (on QEMU
virt, boot with acpi=off; ...)` and stopped, and under `acpi=off` it booted. That was recorded here
as a kernel limit the loader reported rather than one it added, and it was the reason
`scripts/qemu-stick.sh` passed `acpi=off`.

**It is fixed, 2026-09-23.** The loader now reads the tables and **writes the device tree** the kernel would have been
handed (`uefi_loader/src/device_tree_from_acpi.rs`), so `NIFE_ACPI=on scripts/qemu-stick.sh aarch64
target/stick` reaches the same shell prompt `acpi=off` does. The firmware's own tree still wins when
a machine offers both, because it is the richer description. What the two boots differ by, measured
the same day on the same stick:

```text
                  acpi=off (the firmware's tree)         acpi=on (written from ACPI)
  pcie          : ecam 0x4010000000..0x4020000000        none (this machine describes no host bridge)
  memory        : 256 MiB total, 234 MiB free            256 MiB total, 228 MiB free
```

Everything else in the machine description is byte-identical: the same cpu, console, GIC, timer,
MMU and scheduler lines. The PCI bus is missing because an ACPI machine states its BAR windows and
its interrupt routing in AML (`_CRS` and `_PRT`), which needs an interpreter; the six megabytes are
the ACPI tables and firmware runtime regions, which are excluded from the RAM this writes rather
than handed to the frame allocator. `device_tree_from_acpi`'s own BUGS section is the full list.

**Why this matters beyond QEMU**: SBBR requires an aarch64 server to present ACPI and permits it to
present no device tree, so every aarch64 cloud machine (AWS Graviton, Azure Cobalt, Google Axion,
Oracle Ampere A1) is the `acpi=on` case. `notes/rented-metal.md` priced them and found none could
run nife; this is the half of that which was ours to fix.

### The seal, which is structural now

Each boot file is a loader carrying its kernel and the archive that kernel measures, and **the
loader's build refuses a pair that does not match** (`uefi_loader/build.rs`,
`refuse_an_unsealed_pair`): it hashes the archive's `progenitor`, `hello` and
`program_measurements` and requires each digest to occur in the kernel image. Proved both ways on
2026-09-19: the current pair builds, and this tree's kernel beside the main checkout's two-day-old
archive fails with `NOT SEALED: the kernel ... does not vouch for the archive entry 'progenitor'`.
`stick_maker` embeds only finished boot files, so nothing downstream can pair a kernel with the
wrong archive: radon's boot 12 and xenon's 2026-09-17 refusal have no way to happen through it.

## Proved, and how

| Claim | How | Result, 2026-09-19 |
|---|---|---|
| One directory boots on all three firmwares | `cargo xtask stick-boot`: `target/stick` as a USB stick under OVMF, EDK2 aarch64 and EDK2 riscv64 | All three to the progenitor |
| The program writes a stick that boots on all three | `scripts/stick-maker-proof.sh`: a blank file erased, a FAT32 file copied onto, each booted under all three | Six of six to the progenitor; a file already on the FAT32 stick survived |
| Nothing is erased without `--erase` or the disk's name typed back; a refused disk stays refused when named; a host that cannot erase says so before asking | `crates/stick_maker/src/cli.rs`'s tests, which run the whole conversation against a fake host | All pass |
| A backup disk is never offered | `crates/stick_maker` host tests on the captured `diskutil` documents, and `--list --all` on the machine itself | Both USB hard disks refused |
| A mismatched kernel and archive cannot be embedded | The loader's build against a two-day-old archive | Build refused, entry named |
| The x86_64 loader still boots after moving to `arch/x86_64` | `scripts/qemu-uefi-x86_64.sh target/esp` | Unchanged transcript |

## The host axis: what ran, what was only built, what was not built

| Host | Built | Executed |
|---|---|---|
| macOS arm64 | Yes, on the development Mac | **Yes**: discovery against the real disks, both paths against file-backed disks, the written images booted |
| macOS x86_64 | Yes, cross-built (`x86_64-apple-darwin`), and `lipo` joins the two when both are asked for | No (no Intel Mac here) |
| Linux x86_64 | Yes, cross-built static (`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, linked by `rust-lld`) | By CI, on a loop device: `.github/workflows/stick-maker-hosts.yml` |
| Linux arm64 | Yes, cross-built static (`aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`) | No |
| Windows x86_64 and arm64 | **Not from the Mac**: Rust's Windows targets need a MinGW runtime or the Windows SDK to link, and this Mac has neither. Type-checked and linted here for both | By CI on a Windows runner: built for both, discovery run |

```console
$ cargo xtask stick --host aarch64-apple-darwin --host x86_64-apple-darwin \
                    --host x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --host aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Nothing is published. The downloads land in `target/stick-maker/`; putting them on a web page is
rung 4 of §157 and calef's act.

## At the bench: radon and argon

Nothing below has been run. Both boards reach the stick through U-Boot, and **the five-command check
comes first** (radon: notes/visionfive2.md, "To measure at the bench", item 10; argon: milestone
127's block): `usb start`, `usb storage`, `fatls usb 0:1 /`, `help bootefi`, `printenv boot_targets`.

### radon (VisionFive 2)

**A microSD card is a stick too**, and on radon it removes USB from the question entirely: U-Boot
reads the card already, every boot. So write the card with `stick_maker` (it offers SD cards; a card
that is already FAT32 is copied onto, and the existing `nife-vf2.img`, `nife-initrd.img` and
`boot.scr.uimg` stay beside the new files), put it in, interrupt autoboot, and:

```
StarFive # load mmc 1:1 ${kernel_addr_r} /EFI/BOOT/BOOTRISCV64.EFI
StarFive # bootefi ${kernel_addr_r} ${fdtcontroladdr}
```

If `usb storage` found the stick in the five-command check, the same two lines with `usb 0:1` in
place of `mmc 1:1` boot it from USB.

| What radon prints | What it means |
|---|---|
| `nife uefi_loader: milestone 87`, then `boot hart from ...: N`, then the kernel's `hart N booted` | The universal stick works on radon; record which source gave the hart |
| `Unknown command 'bootefi'` | This U-Boot has no UEFI; radon stays on `script/board-image`'s card (U2) |
| The loader's line, then `uefi_loader: the firmware says neither ... which hart this is` | This U-Boot offers neither the RISC-V boot protocol nor `/chosen/boot-hartid`; the loader needs a third source, which is a finding to bring back |
| `uefi_loader: wanted 0x0000000080200000..` and a list of what is in the way | U-Boot's EFI memory map holds the kernel's fixed load address; the listed ranges are the answer |
| The loader's lines and then silence on the console | The handover or the kernel; the same triage as `script/board-image`'s boots, since from `hart N booted` on it is the same kernel |

The riscv64 boot file carries the **`board`** kernel, the one radon runs, and it was proved under
QEMU's EDK2 in that build. Whether radon's U-Boot 2021.10 offers `RISCV_EFI_BOOT_PROTOCOL` or
`/chosen/boot-hartid` is recalled rather than read: both are said to postdate or coincide with that
release, which is exactly why the loader prints which one answered.

### argon (Jetson TX1)

**The aarch64 boot file cannot run nife on argon yet, and the check is still worth making.** The
aarch64 kernel is linked at `0x4008_0000`, which is QEMU `virt`'s RAM; argon's RAM starts at
`0x8000_0000`, so the loader will refuse to place the kernel and print what the firmware's map has
there. That is milestone 127's port to do, for `booti` as much as for this. What the bench learns
now is whether L4T's U-Boot runs our loader and hands it a device tree, which is U1's premise:

```
Tegra210 (P2371-2180) # usb start
Tegra210 (P2371-2180) # load usb 0:1 ${kernel_addr_r} /EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI
Tegra210 (P2371-2180) # bootefi ${kernel_addr_r} ${fdtcontroladdr}
```

| What argon prints | What it means |
|---|---|
| `nife uefi_loader: milestone 87`, then `uefi_loader: wanted 0x0000000040080000..` | **The expected result**: bootefi ran our loader, the tree was offered, and the kernel's load address is the only thing in the way. U1's premise holds on argon |
| `uefi_loader: the firmware offers no device tree` | L4T's `bootefi` was not given a tree; retry with the tree's address as the second argument, from `printenv fdt_addr_r` or `fdtcontroladdr` |
| `Unknown command 'bootefi'` | argon takes U2 until its U-Boot is newer |

(The prompt text is Tegra's recalled default, not read off argon.)

## EXAMPLES

Make a stick on this Mac, from nothing, and prove it before touching a real stick:

```console
$ cargo xtask stick
$ cargo xtask stick-boot
stick-boot: x86_64: booted from BOOTX64.EFI to the progenitor
stick-boot: aarch64: booted from BOOTAA64.EFI to the progenitor
stick-boot: riscv64: booted from BOOTRISCV64.EFI to the progenitor
$ scripts/stick-maker-proof.sh        # about twelve minutes: six boots, each held to its bound
```

Boot any stick image or directory under one firmware by hand:

```console
$ scripts/qemu-stick.sh riscv64 target/stick
$ NIFE_SMP=4 scripts/qemu-stick.sh aarch64 /path/to/written.img
```

Check what a stick carries, on any computer:

```console
$ cat /Volumes/NIFE/NIFE.TXT
$ shasum -a 256 /Volumes/NIFE/EFI/BOOT/*
```

## BUGS

- **No real stick, card or board has been written or booted by any of this.** Every write was to a
  file-backed disk, every boot was QEMU. The first physical stick is calef's, and so is the first
  board boot.
- **The flash-stick fixture is synthesized**, because no stick was attached when the fixtures were
  captured; its first line says so. Capture a real one (`diskutil info -plist diskN`) the first time
  one is at hand and replace it.
- **Some flash sticks clear the removable-media bit** (models sold as "fixed disks", for Windows To
  Go) and are not offered. There is no override flag, deliberately: the bit is what keeps backup
  disks out, and an override is the flag a stranger reaches for first.
- **Windows cannot erase**, and prints the `diskpart` steps; see `crates/stick_maker/src/windows.rs`.
- **Windows cannot be built on the development Mac.** CI builds it; a release process that wants all
  six downloads from one machine needs a MinGW or the Windows SDK there, or a Windows runner.
- **The program is not signed**, by decision (§157). macOS Gatekeeper refuses it on first open and
  Windows SmartScreen warns; the steps past each are rung 4's web page to write, and they move
  between OS releases.
- **The downloads are large, and the profile is not chosen yet.** Measured 2026-09-19 for macOS
  arm64: **41.6 MB** from `cargo xtask stick` (debug payloads: 10.2, 16.0 and 14.4 MB), **20.0 MB**
  from `cargo xtask stick --release` (2.6, 8.3 and 8.2 MB). Both sets boot on all three firmwares.
  The numbers move with every build, as `BOOTX64.EFI`'s already do in notes/x86-uefi-boot.md: the
  debug download was 45.1 MB the same evening, after rebasing onto that day's `main`.
  `cargo xtask stick` defaults to debug like every other xtask build, which is what the bench has
  used; which one a customer downloads is rung 4's choice.
- **A universal macOS binary carries the payload twice**, once per slice: 82.9 MB against 41.6 MB
  for the debug build. Carrying the payload outside the Mach-O slices would halve it, at the cost
  of the program being two files or reading itself.
- **The aarch64 payload runs on QEMU `virt` and nowhere else yet**, for the load-address reason under
  argon. The riscv64 payload is linked for `0x8020_0000`, which radon's RAM contains.
- **Each QEMU proof boot runs to its time bound**, because nife hands over to a shell and never
  exits; `stick-boot` takes about six minutes and the proof script about twelve. Watching the
  transcript and stopping at the progenitor line would cut both to seconds.
