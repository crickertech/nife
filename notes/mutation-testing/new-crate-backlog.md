# The new-crate backlog: a loop that waits

This appendix holds the triage of the seven worst new crates at the 2026-09-14 census, and the
`tests::` exclusion that part of the work added. The summary and the current figures are in
[notes/mutation-testing.md](../mutation-testing.md).

## 2026-09-20: milestone 326 part 3, the new-crate backlog

Part 3 of milestone 326 (nobody has been assigned to turn a mutation score upward) is the rest of
the 1.9-point gap between the like-for-like 93.6% and the corpus 91.7%. That gap is the 26 crates
that did not exist at the August baseline, and the seven worst crates in the tree are all among
them. The block says to take it as a worklist and not to try to close it. So this section accounts
for those seven and stops there.

The discipline is the same as the
[2026-09-19 triage](regressions-capability-to-dtb.md#2026-09-19-milestone-326-triaging-the-censuss-regressions).
Every crate was re-derived with `script/mutation -p <crate>` on this lane's own worktree rather
than read out of the census. Every kill was verified by re-running the sweep and watching the mutant
die. Every equivalence claim below is a mutant the second run still reports.

| crate | before | after | killed | equivalent | excluded | recorded gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `work_steal_slot` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `memory_corruption_canary_gate` | 8 | 2 | 6 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| `soak_page` | 7 | 0 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `jh7110_entropy` | 23 | 10 | 13 | 6 | 0 | 4 |
| `multicast_dns_protocol` | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| `job_mix` | 10 | 4 | 6 | 3 | 0 | 1 |
| `schedule_store` | 8 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **total** | **56** | **16** | **40** | **11** | **1** | **5** |

`before` and `after` count missed plus timeouts, which is what `script/mutation --report` lists as
"the survivors themselves". The one exclusion is a category rather than a crate's business, and is
counted where it was found. Four of the six `jh7110_entropy` equivalents are one line. The
`job_mix` and `jh7110_entropy` rows are worked through in
[job-mix-and-jh7110-entropy](job-mix-and-jh7110-entropy.md).

Two of the census's seven numbers were artifacts of the instrument, and the block predicted one of
them. `work_steal_slot` read 54.2% because its loom model was counted. The `interleavings::` entry
that part 1 added removes it, and the crate now reports 14 mutants, 13 caught, 1 unviable, and no
survivors. Nothing is owed.

`multicast_dns_protocol` read 77.3% with 82 survivors, and is not in this tree. It is the census's
`mdns_proto`, renamed by milestone 265 (`_proto` is a truncation). Milestone 298 (retire the
multicast DNS responder and its two crates) retired both crates on 2026-09-15. That was six weeks
after the baseline and a day after the census. Its row closes by deletion.

`memory_corruption_canary_gate` was the other crate the block flagged as suspect. Once the loom
mutants were out it was genuinely 50.0%, worse than the 66.7% it was flagged at.

### The pattern the whole part turned out to be about: a loop that waits

Eight of the fifty-six survivors were not wrong answers. They were deadlocks, and they are why this
section is ordered as it is rather than worst-first. A spin loop is broken by making it never
accept, and a function that gathers is broken by making it never advance. Neither produces a wrong
return value, because neither returns. The suite hangs, and `cargo mutants` can only report a suite
that did not finish as a timeout. It cannot tell that from a slow suite.

The standing reading, in [how to read the numbers](../mutation-testing.md#how-to-read-the-numbers),
is that such a timeout is the tests noticing rather than missing, and that stays true. What part 3
adds is that noticing by hanging is worth converting into noticing by failing, where the crate
allows it. The difference matters to the person who runs `cargo test` and gets no output at all.

- `memory_corruption_canary_gate`: converted, all four. Every host test body now runs on a worker
  with a five-second deadline. So `arm` and `disarm` failing to accept is a stated assertion
  (`a spin loop never made progress, so the gate deadlocked`) instead of a hung binary. A panic
  inside the body drops the sender, so a real assertion failure and a hang are told apart. Liveness
  is a property this crate owes the kernel more than the host: `arm` spins on a core its owner
  cannot be preempted from.
- `job_mix`: removed, by deleting the loop. Its one timeout was `jobs_of_kind`'s hand-rolled index
  under `*=`, which never advances. A `for &k in &MIX` has no increment to lose, so the mutant does
  not exist rather than being caught. That is rung one of AGENTS.md's ladder where the old code sat
  at rung zero.
- `jh7110_entropy`: not converted, for a measured reason. `Pool::take`'s four timeouts are the same
  shape, and `take_returns_rather_than_spinning` now states the property on a deadline. The
  classification does not move, because `Pool`'s own doctest calls `take` directly. `cargo test`
  runs doctests, and a doctest has nowhere to put a deadline. Confirmed by hand-applying the
  `self.cursor != self.filled` mutant and running `cargo test -p jh7110_entropy --doc`, which sat
  at `has been running for over 60 seconds`. These are recorded as four gaps. Closing them needs a
  way to tell a deadlock timeout from a slow-test one, which cargo-mutants 27.1.0 does not offer.
  Its whole set of limits is the clock, per milestone 277 (bound what one mutant may allocate)'s
  own check.

### The exclusion, which is measured and not assumed

`.cargo/mutants.toml` grows a third `exclude_re` entry, `tests::`. It belongs with the two that
part 1 added, and not by coincidence. (Corrected 2026-09-24: it is the fourth `exclude_re` entry.
`verification::` and `proofs::` date from 2026-08-03. Part 1 added `interleavings::`, plus the
`**/src/proofs.rs` and `**/src/verification.rs` globs in `exclude_globs`.)

cargo-mutants already declines to mutate anything under a plain `#[cfg(test)]`. It does not
recognise the compound form. The five loom crates have to write `#[cfg(all(test, not(loom)))]`,
because the loom model is the other half of the same `test` cfg. So a helper function in one of
those modules is mutated where the identical helper in an ordinary crate is not. That is how
`memory_corruption_canary_gate`'s new deadline helper came back MISSED the moment it was written.

Measured, as the seven-questions rule asks: `cargo mutants -p calendar --list` returns 395 mutants
and none of them is `tests::*`. Yet `calendar`'s test module has a `fields` helper of exactly the
shape that was mutated here.

A mutant of a test helper is never a defect in the shipped system. That makes this a stronger
exclusion than the other two. `verification::` and `interleavings::` at least name real code with a
checker of its own; this names code that is compiled into nothing.

### `work_steal_slot`: no survivors, and the census's 54.2% was the loom model

Before and after: 14 mutants, 13 caught, 1 unviable. Nothing was owed and nothing was done. The
block listed this crate first and called its number suspect. The number was the `mod interleavings`
block, which part 1's exclusion removes. What is left is a crate whose tests kill everything.

### `memory_corruption_canary_gate`: 8 survivors, 6 killed, 2 equivalent

Before: 8 caught, 4 missed, 4 timeouts, 2 unviable (50.0% of viable). After: 14 caught, 2 missed,
2 unviable (87.5%). The census read 66.7%; the difference is the loom mutants leaving the count.

The four timeouts are the deadline conversion above. They are `arm`'s two acceptance tests
(`seen == DISARMED` under `!=`, and the `||` under `&&`) and `disarm`'s `seen == ARMED` under `!=`.
The fourth is deleting `ArmGuard`'s `Drop`, which strands the gate in `ARMING` so the next `disarm`
never returns.

The two real misses were both the re-arm transition. Nothing in the suite armed an already armed
gate. Every other path reaches `arm` from `DISARMED`. That is the one state where an `arm` that
returns its guard *without* winning the compare-exchange is invisible: the gate is not `ARMED`
either way, so `armed_hint` (now `is_armed_hint`) and `try_check` answer the same. From `ARMED` the
same mistake leaves the old plan readable, and admits a check pass while the plan is being
rewritten. That is the torn plan the module documentation is about, and the bug this crate exists to
fix. Closed by `rearming_an_armed_gate_takes_it_out_of_armed`. It kills `&&`-to-`||` outright and
takes `seen == ARMED` under `!=` into the deadline.

The two equivalents are `pause`, and they are two functions rather than one.

- `#[cfg(not(loom))] fn pause` under `()` (1). The body is `core::hint::spin_loop()`, a scheduling
  hint with no semantic effect. The loop still spins, and the protocol cannot observe whether the
  hint was issued. It is equivalent by construction, which is why the same function can be written
  twice under two cfgs.
- `#[cfg(loom)] fn pause` under `()` (1). The loom twin is `loom::thread::yield_now()`. Removing it
  is not equivalent under loom, where the yield is what tells the model checker the loop is
  waiting. It is unreachable rather than equivalent: `cargo test` never compiles it. It is the same
  object as the `interleavings::` module one level down. It cannot be excluded the same way,
  because a free function's mutant name carries no module path. The two `pause` mutants are
  therefore indistinguishable by regex. `script/interleaving-check` is its checker.

### `soak_page`: 7 survivors, 7 killed, none left

Before: 15 caught, 7 missed (68.2%). After: 22 caught, 0 missed (100.0%). The whole crate is four
`const fn`s and a transform.

Five of the seven were offsets that give two workers the same eight bytes. They were `rounds`
collapsed to a constant, striding by one instead of eight, dividing instead of multiplying, and
`mismatches` and `wakes` counting backwards through their arrays. The two existing tests check that
each offset fits in the page, and that the ends of each array clear the start of the next. Every
one of those five mutants passes both. The page's entire lock-free argument is that each `u64` has
exactly one writer. A collision is not a slow workload, it is a silent one. The module documentation
says so two paragraphs before the functions that were wrong.

Closed by `every_slot_is_its_own_aligned_word`, which asserts distinctness and 8-alignment across
all 192 slots. It checks distinctness and not values, deliberately. The kernel and the workload
both reach the page through these functions, so any injective, aligned, in-page assignment is
correct. Pinning the arithmetic would test the code against itself.

The seventh was `answer`'s `^` becoming `|`. The three existing assertions all pass under `|`:
neighbouring sequence numbers differ, no answer is zero, and no answer echoes its input. A mask
still varies and still never produces zero. What it stops being is a bijection, and injectivity is
the whole reason the transform exists: "a reply carrying *some* value is not mistaken for a reply
carrying the *right* value". Closed by `the_answers_share_no_bit_in_common`, which intersects
sixty-four answers. A mask leaves its own bits standing in every output; a xor clears a bit as often
as it sets one. That is a total tell rather than a sampled one, and cheaper than hunting a
collision.

### `schedule_store`: 8 survivors, 8 killed, none left

Before: 29 caught, 8 missed, 5 unviable (78.4%). After: 37 caught, 0 missed (100.0%).

Six were a `>` that could become `>=` with nothing noticing, and they are one blind spot. Every
refusal test in this crate hands the code a value one past the limit: a name of
`MAX_IDENTITY_LEN + 1` bytes, `MAX_IDENTITIES + 1` identities, a three-byte buffer for a five-byte
name. A value one past the limit is refused either way. Nothing asked what happens *at* the limit.
A store that quietly lost the 64th byte of a name would have passed the whole suite. So would one
that lost the eighth identity, or the last byte a buffer had room for. Closed by
`the_last_thing_that_fits_still_fits`, through both the parse and the render half of each bound.

The buffer case is more than a lost feature. The bound is `n + name.len() + 1 > buf.len()`, where
the `+ 1` is the newline not yet written. Two mutants (`-` and `*` in place of that `+`) drop the
term. The check then passes on a buffer with room for the name but not its terminator. The next
line indexes one past the end of a caller's buffer, and in a `no_std` crate the kernel links, that
is a panic rather than a wrong answer.
`the_buffer_bound_counts_the_newline_it_has_not_written_yet` holds both sides: a buffer of exactly
the document's length renders, and one byte less is refused.

The other two were `Error::line`, which no test called at all. The refusal tests compare whole
variants (`Err(Error::NameTooLong(1))`). So the accessor a caller actually reads the line through
was never exercised, and a `line` returning a constant was invisible. A configuration error pointing
at the wrong line is what this crate's 1-based convention exists to prevent. It inherits that
convention from `timetable::Error`, with the reason attached: "a configuration error nobody can find
in the file is one nobody will fix". `each_error_carries_the_line_it_is_about` reads it on line 3
and line 9, neither of which is a constant a mutant would reach for.
