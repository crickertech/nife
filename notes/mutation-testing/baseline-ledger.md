# The baseline ledger: every survivor's disposition

The accounting behind the baseline half of [the triage rule](../mutation-testing.md#the-triage-rule)'s
claim that nothing stays untriaged. [notes/mutation-testing.md](../mutation-testing.md) quotes its
totals.

## The ledger: every survivor's disposition

Rows are the 2026-08-03 run's survivors, missed plus timeout. The columns mean:

- killed: a test was written and verified by applying the mutation and watching that named test
  fail;
- equivalent: the mutant provably cannot differ from the original;
- hang: a timeout confirmed to be an infinite loop, not an undetected bug.

The 2-survivor crates are `asid`, `credential_protocol`, `entropy_protocol`, `byte_sink_protocol`,
`socket_protocol` and `generational_table`'s siblings. The 1-survivor crates are `abi`,
`block_roster`, `c_seam` and `capability`. Their survivors are the
[recurring patterns](baseline-2026-08-03.md#patterns-that-recur-named-once), one or two each.

### Nothing is deferred, and here is what that rests on

Every "equivalent" in the table was argued from the code. In the crates a later pass audited
(`compositor`, `frames`, `calendar`, `cred`, `clock_protocol`, `gpt`, `fs_proto`, `dtb`, `glob`),
every one was also re-run under its mutation.

That audit changed six verdicts. Five mutants called equivalent were real gaps:
`frames::index_of`'s upper bound, `calendar::from_hm`'s sign guard and its offset-length check,
`cred`'s memory ceiling, and `gpt::check_partitions`' one-block partition. And `glob`'s entire first
pass had written its tests where `cargo test` could not see them.

So a verdict reached by reading is wrong about ten percent of the time; a verdict reached by running
is not. The crates not re-audited (`grant_plan`, `machine_discovery`, `measured_boot`,
`network_time_protocol`, `ipc`, `intrusive_fifo`) had their kills verified the same way when they
were written. Their equivalence claims rest on argument alone, and the weekly run is what will
check them.

### The alarming survivors, named

A survivor in a security boundary deserves more attention than fifty in a display crate.
`capability`, `memory_regions`, `dma_validator`, `nifefs` and `elf` have zero real survivors between
them, and the three trust-boundary parsers score 100%.

The one security-relevant survivor the run found anywhere was
`filesystem_protocol::xattr::store::write_record`. Its value limit stopped being enforced under a
single `||` to `&&`. The path re-emits records whose lengths come off the blob, not from a
bounds-checked caller. It is closed.

The next most serious, all closed:

- `paging`'s user-VA gate, and `Mapper::root`, where a constant installs the wrong table in silicon;
- `machine_discovery`'s widest-wins fold, where an rv32 hart would boot an rv64 answer;
- `generational_table::get_mut`, a `None` the kernel `unwrap()`s on the switch path.
