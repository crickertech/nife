# The baseline survivors, crate by crate: `abi` to `ipc`

How each survivor of [the 2026-08-03 baseline](baseline-2026-08-03.md) was closed, for the crates
from `abi` to `ipc`, under [the triage rule](../mutation-testing.md#the-triage-rule) of
[notes/mutation-testing.md](../mutation-testing.md). The rest are in
[grant_plan to swish](baseline-survivors-grant-plan-to-swish.md), and
[the ledger](baseline-ledger.md) totals them. "As above" refers to
[the patterns named once](baseline-2026-08-03.md#patterns-that-recur-named-once).

## The hand-triaged crates

### `abi` (5)

Rights bits and the fault slot, killed by `rights_are_distinct_single_bits` and
`the_fault_slot_is_inside_the_capability_table`. `1 << 0` is equivalent, as above.

### `asid` (2)

Both are in `free`'s release-mode range guard. Equivalent under the harness (`debug_assert`
shielding, as above).

### `block_roster` (3)

The header-only page, killed by `a_header_only_page_is_an_empty_roster_not_a_short_one`.
`capacity_of`'s `<` to `<=` is equivalent: `len == HEADER_BYTES` yields capacity 0 down both arms.

### `c_seam` (5)

Verdict bits, killed by `the_verdict_bits_are_distinct_single_bits`. The `1 << 0` sibling is
equivalent.

### `calendar` (18)

Two real parser edges, killed by `parser_edges_the_mutation_run_found`:

- A fraction scan that could read one past the end.
- An offset-colon check whose index could rot to `i - 3`. That lands on the seconds colon in every
  well-formed input, so `+05300` parsed.

The absolute weekday, unix zero without `-0`, the three `Formatted` impls, and one message per
refusal each got their own test.

The audit added two more:

- `from_hm`'s `hours < 0` is not masked by the `!= 0` clauses; only its `<=` siblings are. Rotted
  to `hours == 0`, it refuses `from_hm(-5, -30)`, which is how -05:30 is written. It also accepts
  `from_hm(-5, 30)` as -07:30. Every test used positive hours, which is one row of the guard's
  truth table.
- The six-byte guard ahead of the offset is a length check, not a trailing-bytes check. Rotted to
  `<`, it refuses the same inputs and renames one refusal, so `+05:60x` is now pinned as
  `BadOffset`.

Equivalent:

- `from_hm`'s two `<` to `<=` mutants, masked by the `!= 0` clauses beside them.
- `Writer::byte`'s capacity guard. `FMT_CAP` is two bytes over the longest output, so the boundary
  is unreachable.
- `Writer::offset`'s sign at zero. Both format paths branch to `Z`/`UTC` before a zero offset can
  reach it.
- The redundant `+ with -` at the offset-length guard. The `number`/`expect` helpers bounds-check
  behind it, so every path still errors identically.

### `capability` (11)

Rights bits, `from_bits` masking (an OR there turns undefined bits into defined rights), idempotent
union, and `insert_at` landing in the named slot. Killed by `rights_bits_are_the_wire_format` and
`insert_at_fills_exactly_the_named_slot`.

### `clock_protocol` (10)

The request wire format and the sanity window's seconds-times-a-billion arithmetic. Killed by
`the_request_word_is_the_wire_format_it_claims` and `the_sanity_window_is_where_it_says`.

Equivalent:

- The CAS's `s + 1` (single-threaded blindness, as above). Nothing observes the odd window, and the
  sequence still advances by two.
- `decide`'s `>` at equal timestamps. A zero step is accepted down both branches.

The other seven seqlock mutants are not equivalent and are not survivors. Flipping either spin
guard or the reread check makes a single-threaded `read` or `publish` spin forever, so all seven are
timeouts.

### `cred` (21)

The longest legal identity and secret were never exercised end to end. The redacting `Debug` could
be replaced with one that prints nothing. And the memory ceiling could become either a divide or an
add, and only the divide was caught.

The test meant to hold the ceiling named it as `Cost::MAX_M_KIB` on both sides of its own
assertion. `1024 / 1024` is 1, which falls below `MIN_M_COST` and fails. But `1024 + 1024` is 2048,
a legal cost. So every symbolic check passed while every real policy was refused. The ceiling is now
pinned as `1_048_576`, hand-computed: the nifefs lesson applied to a constant instead of an image.

Killed by `the_longest_identity_and_secret_are_legal`,
`the_cost_is_what_it_says_up_to_the_real_ceiling`, `a_store_is_empty_until_it_is_not`, and
`debug_prints_the_redaction_and_nothing_secret`.

Equivalent: `MAX_P_COST`'s exact value. Any `p` large enough to notice it already fails the
`m_kib < p * 8` check first.

### `cred_proto` (6 after the `proofs::` exclusion)

- The request word is pinned as one exact number with opcode `SEAL`. Every prior test used opcode
  1, so an `op` returning the constant 1 passed.
- The smallest page the layout fits is accepted at both ends.
- `wipe`'s bound is asserted from both sides.

Equivalent: the two `|` to `^` mutants in `req`. The three fields are masked into disjoint bit
ranges, and `x | y == x ^ y` whenever `x & y == 0`.

### `coremark` (2)

Both equivalent by arithmetic. The list tie-break's `>` to `>=` shifts an equal u16 past an equal
u16, which is bytewise identity, so the published-CRC pin cannot see it. The fsm counter tops out
at 256, so bits 16 and up are zero down both shift directions.

### `compositor` (66, the largest cluster)

The pattern generators mixed bits that no test compared against a known answer. So every `&` could
become `|` and every shift could reverse. Killed by five tests:

- Two hand-computed pixels per generator, at coordinates whose bit patterns distinguish the
  operators.
- The surface checksum pinned to an independently computed FNV-1a value, plus a read count.
- The window digest cross-checked row-major.
- Stride and `MAX_SURFACE_BYTES` as exact numbers.
- A zero-width rect asserted empty.

Equivalent (14, audited one by one): min/max selections at equal operands, `|` vs `^` over disjoint
masked bit fields, and a max-accumulate's `>` at equality. Also `intersect`'s early return, since
the arithmetic path returns EMPTY anyway.

### `nifefs` (12) and `dma_validator` (12)

All 24 were real gaps, none equivalent, which fits both crates' role as trust-boundary parsers. Two
causes recurred:

- Layout constants with no independent pin. Every test compared an image against the constant it
  was built from, so both sides moved together. The documented values are now hand-computed in the
  tests.
- Boundaries never hit exactly. A file ending exactly at the image end now round-trips; one byte
  under is truncated.

dma_validator's ring tests had all used batch indices where `slot * 2`, `slot + 2`, `idx % 8` and
`idx / 8` coincide. A batch starting at index 11 separates all four. Poisoned slots catch a walk
landing anywhere but the declared next. Six of the subtlest kills were verified by applying the
mutation by hand and watching the test fail.

### `frames` (5)

Three real, killed by `the_base_frame_and_the_empty_range_are_exact`: a stuck `Some(true)` from
`is_used`, `index_of` refusing the base frame, and a zero-size `mark_used` rounding up to one frame.

Equivalent:

- The alloc hint. It is an optimization; a scan starting on the just-used frame finds the same next
  free one.
- `alloc_contiguous`'s early return. No run of zero or of more than `total` ever matches, so the
  scan reproduces it.

### `elf` (10)

All real, none equivalent. Every fixture set PF_R, so `is_readable`'s mask could become any operator
and the validator's execute-only branch was dead in the suite. Now:

- An execute-only segment asserts both sides.
- The header-table bounds get their exact edges.
- `u16le` is pinned on bytes whose halves differ. Every field in the old fixtures had a zero high
  byte, so reading the wrong neighbour byte read the same.

### `entropy_protocol` (3)

`op` is pinned with a non-GET opcode. `GET` is 1, so a body replaced by the constant 1 passed every
round trip.

Equivalent: `|` vs `^` over disjoint masked operands, and `want`'s `>` at `n == MAX_BYTES`, where
both branches return the same 8.

### `graphics_protocol` (22)

The test pattern's channel math had no pinned pixel, so a wrong buffer could only be wrong the same
way on both sides. Closed by five hand-computed pixels, a one-bit-change digest test, and the
errno's minus sign. The digest is an FNV whose xor, turned to or, collides exactly where it matters.

Equivalent (7): OR-vs-XOR in `req` and the `rect` packing, where every field is masked into disjoint
bits.

### `glob` (21)

The first pass wrote both of its new tests inside `#[cfg(kani)] mod verification` instead of
`mod tests`. `cargo test` never compiled them, so they killed nothing. The paragraph that claimed
fourteen kills was describing tests that had never run. `.cargo/mutants.toml` already records why:
`mod verification` is invisible to `cargo test`, which is the reason mutants inside it are excluded.
Both tests are good, both kill once moved, and moving them takes eleven of the twenty-one.
**`script/lint` now fails on a `#[test]` inside a `#[cfg(kani)]` module.** There are 22 such
modules in the tree, and this failure mode reports a coverage it does not have.

The step count is the DoS-bound contract. Kani proves only that it stays under `cost_bound`, which a
counter stuck at zero also satisfies. So each class feature now costs exactly its own scan. And
`[A-\]]` matches at its endpoint and resumes after the escape. A class ending in a bare escape is
unterminated rather than a read past the end.

The remaining three needed arithmetic nobody would guess at:

- `scanned += after_hi - after_lo` charges exactly the bytes a range skips. A resume index landing
  inside the range re-scans one at a time what it should have stepped over, and the ledger
  balances. No step assertion can see it. Membership can: resuming at the `-` makes `[a-c]` match a
  hyphen, and resuming at the high end makes `[z-a]` match `a`. A wider class is a larger grant.
- `2 + 2 == 2 * 2`. At the head of a one-member class `scanned` is 2 and the tail is 2 bytes. So the
  addition and the multiplication agree, and so do `4 - 2` and `4 / 2`. One member in front
  (`[xa-c]`) separates all four.

The 7 timeouts are all detected hangs, every one a cursor that stops advancing. No equivalent
mutants and nothing deferred: 21 of 21.

### `dtb` (52, second largest)

One recurring cause. Every test tree declared the fixtures' 2/2 cell layout. So the
`#address-cells` match arms could be deleted, inheritance could stop at the default, and a `reg`
could decode with its own node's widths instead of its parent's, all invisibly.

Closed in two passes, nineteen `hostile.rs` tests in all. The first eleven covered:

- the 1-cell layout, inheritance, and parent-vs-own decode;
- the compatible walker's root guard, and prop lookup;
- a reservation block with entries, including one at address zero, which an `&&` rotted to `||`
  reads as the terminator;
- initrd's widths and exclusive end;
- the header comparisons met exactly.

**A second pass audited the first against the survivor list and found thirteen not actually
killed.** Most were the `reserved_memory_regions` cluster, which nothing had ever called off the
fixtures. Eight more tests closed those, three verified by applying the mutation and watching the
one test fail. Reasoning about which test kills which mutant is fallible, and the weekly rerun is
the check on it.

The 20 timeouts are detected hangs, each confirmed by applying the mutation and watching the suite
fail to finish. Fourteen are a cursor `+=` becoming `-=`. The walker bounces between two offsets
that both read as an empty-named `FDT_BEGIN_NODE`. The other six are a plain `+` becoming `-` in
`let value_at = at + 8`, a different mechanism: `at` lands back on the same `FDT_PROP` token and the
walker re-reads one property forever.

Equivalent: `cells()`'s `|` vs `^`, which ORs into freshly shifted zeros. Confirmed by reading the
masks and by running it.

### `fs_proto` (72 after the `proofs::` exclusion; the largest crate)

Two findings. Most survivors were equivalent, not gaps. A later pass audited that claim site by site
rather than in aggregate, because "the masks are disjoint" is a sentence about 26 different lines.

Every request word, spec word and rights bundle ORs fields the code masks into disjoint bit ranges,
so `|` and `^` agree on every reachable input:

- `fs::req` splits 63:56, 55:40 and 39:0.
- `grant::spec` puts the length under `0xff` and the rights above bit 8.
- `xattr::spec` and `xattr::reply` split at bit 32.
- The six `dir` rights and the eight `attrs` claims are distinct single bits.

All 26 were checked against the constants, and 14 were hand-mutated, one per distinct expression.
Two more are the `verb::TABLE` order check inside a `const _: ()` block. Both mutants only make the
loop vacuous, and a `const` item has no runtime observable, so no test can reach them. The property
is pinned at runtime by `every_verb_has_a_row_that_says_what_its_words_mean`.

**The audit found one claim that was wrong.** `xattr::store::write_record`'s guard is not a mask.
With its second `||` turned into `&&`, the value limit stops being enforced, because the name clause
beside it is dead in both callers. That limit is load-bearing. `set` and `remove` re-emit records
whose lengths come off the blob rather than from a bounds-checked caller. A value length is a `u16`
reaching 65535 against a `MAX_VALUE` of 3072. Killed by
`a_record_wider_than_the_contract_is_refused_when_a_blob_is_rewritten`.

The real gaps:

- The rights bundles as numbers (an `&` in `REMOVE_TREE` collapsed it to zero).
- One sentence per explained errno.
- The verb predicates as an exact partition.
- Both dirent length limits.
- `pack_name` handed a seventeen-byte name (the mutated bound indexes past the packed word and
  panics).
- The nameset cursor, byte for byte.
- The attribute record's exact bytes at an exactly sized buffer.
- Every witness verdict module pinned to distinct single bits. Both ends of a QEMU test build their
  words from the same constants, so a shifted-to-zero claim silently stops being checked.

### `gpt`, second pass (18 more)

The interrupted run's resume reached the modules [the first pass](baseline-2026-08-03.md#gpt-one-real-bug-fourteen-missing-tests)
never got to: entry, guid, header, span, and the MBR validator. The survivors were the same two
shapes.

- Boundaries never met exactly: a header the size of its block, a partition on the first usable
  block, an exact-fit name buffer, and entry sizes other than 128. Every fixture uses 128, so the
  size guard had never been judged.
- Values every fixture shared. The protective record was always in MBR slot 0, where `i * 16` is
  immune to arithmetic mutation. Every partition name was ASCII, whose UTF-16 high byte is zero,
  which hid an off-by-one in name decode.

One test each. `check_protective_mbr` also needed one bad block through the wrapper, since every
existing call handed it a good one.

Equivalent:

- The hex-nibble `|` vs `^` (disjoint bits).
- The span guard on a 64-bit host. It stops being equivalent the day anything builds for a 32-bit
  target, which is exactly when you want the signal.
- `1 << 0` under shift direction.
- `<` vs `<=` at the backup-reserve underflow guard. A disk that small dies on another arm of the
  same refusal.

The audit found one more real gap of the first shape. `check_partitions`' `last_lba < first_lba`
rotted to `<=` refuses a partition of exactly one block. That is legal, because `last_lba` is
inclusive. Every partition in both suites spans thousands of blocks, so the check had only ever
been met from far away.

### `intrusive` (3)

The run queue's `len` was asserted after every push and never after a pop, so `-=` could become
`+=`. `is_empty` was only met empty. Both are now asserted mid-drain in `fifo_order`.

### `ipc` (5)

The manual `PartialEq` impls were only ever compared equal, so a body stuck at `true` passed.
Distinct variants now must disagree, and the hang-dump `Debug` strings are pinned.

Equivalent: `one_queue_invariant` replaced with `true`. The API maintains the invariant, so no
reachable endpoint state returns false. The checker exists for kernel-side debug assertions whose
states are built by kernel code this crate cannot construct.
