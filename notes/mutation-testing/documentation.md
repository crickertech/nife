# `documentation`: a crate scored with a third of its tests compiled away

This appendix of [notes/mutation-testing.md](../mutation-testing.md) holds the 2026-09-13 finding
that `documentation`'s 52% was measured with a third of its tests compiled away, the fix and its
gate, and the crate's full survivor ledger.

## 2026-09-13: `documentation`'s 52% was a crate scored with a third of its tests compiled away

This is milestone 280 (`uefi_loader` at 15% and `documentation` at 52% are unexplained holes in the
published score). [The 2026-09-03 sample](the-first-weekly-censuses.md) named `manual` (ratified
`documentation` on 2026-09-13) as the second of two crates carrying the tree's fall from 92.4%. It
stood at 56 caught, 60 missed in the round-robin sample. [`uefi_loader`](uefi-loader.md) went first
and turned out to be arithmetic. This one was expected to be the real gap, because it is ordinary
host-testable `no_std` Rust with no allocator on the read path.

It was both, and the measurement bug was the larger half. This is the `system_initializer` result
(milestone 244 (the largest crate in the tree is proved by nothing a mutation can reach)) and the
`uefi_loader` result (2026-09-04) a third time, one level further in. It is not a crate the host
suite cannot compile, nor a target the build graph never selects. **It is a Cargo feature that a
single-package test run does not turn on.**

`cargo-mutants` tests one package at a time. `--test-workspace` is off by default, and turning it on
would run the whole workspace suite once per mutant. So every number this sweep ever published for
this crate came from `cargo test -p documentation` with that crate's default features. `builder` is
not one. It gates the index writer, which allocates, and it is off by default so the guest program
links no allocator. Ninety-two of the crate's 1,043 mutants live behind it, and nothing could ever
have killed one.

The writer was not the cost, though, and nobody had noticed. `builder` also gates six of the crate's
twelve index tests, because a test that reads an index needs `build` to make one. So the run compiled
away half the index suite and scored the reader against what was left. `lookup`, `postings`,
`page_record`, `score`, `Ranked::offer`, `search` and `location` had no test at all in the
configuration being measured.

### The numbers, whole-crate, same machine, same pinned tool

| | mutants | caught | missed | timeout | unviable | killed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| as the sweep measures it, before | 1,043 | 499 | 455 | 48 | 41 | **54.6%** |
| with `builder` compiled, before any new test | 1,043 | 733 | 211 | 58 | 41 | **78.9%** |
| **after milestone 280** | 1,056 | 908 | 47 | 60 | 41 | **95.4%** |

"Killed" is caught plus timeout over viable, the same arithmetic as
[the baseline table](baseline-2026-08-03.md). The published 52% was a one-eighth sample. The
whole-crate figure in that same configuration is 54.6%, so the sample was honest about a crate being
measured wrongly.

### The fix, and why it is not `--all-features`

The fix is a dev-dependency on itself. Cargo allows a package to depend on itself for tests only, and
resolver 2 unifies the feature across the test build. So `cargo test -p documentation` now compiles
the builder and runs all twelve index tests, while `cargo build -p documentation` still does not.
Nothing a consumer sees changes, because a dev dependency is not transitive. `user` and `swish` link
no allocator and did not have to say so.

`--all-features` was measured rather than assumed, and it fails.
`cargo check -p uefi_loader --all-features` panics in that crate's build script without
`NIFE_UEFI_KERNEL`, by design, because the UEFI application embeds the kernel it boots. Three
packages in this workspace declare a feature (`documentation`, `kernel`, `uefi_loader`), and they
want three different answers. One global switch is wrong for at least two of them.

`script/lint` gained the third gate in this family, beside the two the earlier findings left. It
derives from `cargo metadata` that every feature of every mutated crate is enabled when that crate's
own tests run. `required-features` is the one honest exemption: a feature whose only job is to gate
targets already excluded (`uefi_loader`'s `uefi`) has no library code to compile. The gate was
verified in both directions, by removing the dev-dependency and watching it name the crate and the
feature.

`script/coverage` hit exactly this failure on this crate two weeks earlier and fixed only itself.
That is why a gate was worth the twenty lines. On 2026-08-30 (PR #590, milestone 87 (the x86_64
bare-metal machine)) the coverage floor reported 33.3% on an index reader that is round-tripped
against its own writer, because `builder` was off. It grew `--features documentation/builder` and a
comment saying that a feature gating something un-buildable *"is a trap for every workspace-wide
sweep, not just this one"*. The mutation config's own head comment asks the next person to keep the
two lists in step. It was not touched, and fourteen days later it published 52% for the same crate
for the same reason. That is rung four doing what rung four does.

### Two features the sweep found that no test could have

Both have one shape, and a mutation run is the only instrument in the tree that sees it: **a value
computed correctly and read by nobody.** There is no output for a test to assert, so the code cannot
fail. The tell is a cluster of survivors inside one function, including the mutant that replaces the
whole function with `()`.

- Table column alignment. `read_align` parsed `:---`, `---:` and `:---:` off the delimiter row into
  a per-column array from the first day. `flush_table` padded every cell on the right whatever that
  array held, so all three rendered identically to `---`. Sixteen survivors. It is honoured now, and
  resets with `delimited`, because both are properties of one delimiter row.
- Tab indentation. `indent_of` returns a byte offset and a column count, counting a tab as four
  columns. Every caller took the offset and dropped the count, including the one that uses it as a
  margin. It is invisible on this corpus, which is why only a sweep could have found it: every
  tab-indented line in this repository's markdown is inside a fence, where that code does not run.

### The ledger for this crate

Forty-nine tests were added across four passes (the crate had 32 and has 81). Each was written
against a named survivor rather than against a feature list. The dispositions of what the final run
still reports, in [the triage rule's](../mutation-testing.md#the-triage-rule) vocabulary:

| | count | what they are |
|---|---|---|
| killed | 164 | the fall in missed mutants from 211, each kill verified by the sweep itself |
| equivalent | 17 | proved unable to differ; the groups are below |
| hang | 60 | every timeout is a loop counter or a loop bound, listed below |
| deferred | 30 | real gaps whose test needs a fixture sitting on an exact byte boundary |

#### The equivalence groups

A verdict reached by reading is wrong about ten percent of the time
([the baseline ledger](baseline-ledger.md)). These are the ones to re-check first.

- `lookup`'s `here` (3). `(h.terms - lo * per).min(per)` is the count of records to search on the
  final page. Every mutant of it yields a value at least the true one, and `.min(per)` caps them all
  at the 128 records the page buffer holds, so none can under-read. The records past the real end
  are the builder's zero padding. There `cmp` reads a length byte of zero and compares an empty slice
  against a non-empty key, which is `Less` and never `Equal`. Verified by applying one of them:
  Rust's left-associativity turns `terms - lo * per` into `(terms - lo) + per`, not the underflow the
  mutant looks like.
- The output cursor where nothing reads it (5). `Renderer::col` has two consumers: a wrap decision,
  and `close_line`'s "is a line open" test. Inside `rule` and `flush_table`'s row loops the next
  thing to touch it is `close_line`. Every row ends with `col += width` for a width of at least one,
  so a wrong value cannot reach zero and cannot reach a wrap. The mutants that can are killed: a
  blank line inside a fence (the one code line of zero visible width), an image followed by text
  that wraps, and a quoted paragraph at two levels.
- Absorbed by the code after them (8):
  - `line_done`'s explicit space-skip after a block quote marker is redundant with the `indent_of`
    call on the next line, twice.
  - `heading_at` guarantees a space at the index `heading` slices from, and `inline` skips leading
    spaces, so an off-by-one there emits the same words.
  - `read_align` starting at the `|` instead of past it produces an empty first spec, which it
    already skips.
  - `flush_table`'s `vis > width` assigns the same value under `>=`.
  - The column-selection `c < cols[r]` under `<=` reads a `(0, 0)` cell that is the same as its own
    else branch.
  - `search`'s `done < count` under `<=` runs one more iteration that asks for zero postings and
    breaks.
  - `finish`'s `used > 0` under `>=` ends the document by classifying a line of no bytes, which
    emits nothing.
- `title_of`'s line walk (1). `while start < text.len()` under `<=` runs one extra iteration on an
  empty slice, which is never a heading.

#### The deferrals, and what each one's test would cost

Thirty, recorded as gaps rather than equivalents:

- The inline scanner's `i + 1` forms at the exact last byte of a line (19). Every one is a lookahead
  guarded by `i + 1 < end`. The mutants either drop the guard or read one byte past the classified
  span. A test needs a line whose final byte is the opening half of a two-byte marker: `~`, `!` or
  `*` as the last character, with the construct it would open truncated by the line ending. Fifteen
  of the nineteen also need the depth counter at its bound at the same time.
- The table arenas at their exact fill points (5). `take_table_row`'s row buffer flushes when the
  cell text would pass 8,192 bytes, and the mutants move that threshold by one or change which sum is
  compared. A test has to build a table whose cumulative cell text lands on 8,192 exactly, which pins
  an implementation constant rather than a property. `read_align`'s cell walk wants the same.
- The output cursor where it feeds a wrap (4). `unit`, `unit_bytes`, `unit_wrapped` and
  `before_unit` are the four places `col` is read again before `line_start` resets it. The three
  passes above killed the ones that reach zero or move a visible wrap. What is left needs the cursor
  wrong by an amount that lands on a wrap boundary.
- `past_quote`'s loop bound (2). Its three length tests are separated by the blank-quoted-line test
  above. The two on the loop condition itself want a fence opened at a depth greater than the
  markers any line inside it carries, at the exact byte where the line ends.

A mutation of any of these changes behaviour only for an input this repository's markdown does not
contain. That is also the limit of the renderer's own argument. It was written instead of taking
`pulldown-cmark` on the grounds that the input set *is* this repository, so a gap outside that set is
exactly the cost that bargain has.

#### The timeouts are hangs

Every one of them is loop control. Fifty-seven of the 60 are `+=` or `-=` on a loop counter or the
bound of a `while`. They are spread over `inline` (12), `unit_wrapped` (6), `lookup` (5), `line_done`
(5), `closer` (4), `read_align` (3), `pad` (3), and eleven others. The remaining three replace a
whole function whose return value is the loop's step: `char_len -> 0` and
`closer -> Some(0)`/`Some(1)`. Each leaves the caller advancing by nothing.

A mutant that makes a loop stop advancing hangs rather than lying, which is the tests noticing.
[Scope and honest caveats](../mutation-testing.md#scope-and-honest-caveats) says a timeout on a
mutant that could not hang would be triaged as a survivor instead, and none of these is that.
