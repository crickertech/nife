# The 2026-09-14 regressions: `clock_protocol`, `swish`, `filesystem_protocol`

The second half of milestone 326 (nobody has been assigned to turn a mutation score upward)'s
triage of the crates that regressed at the 2026-09-14 census. It verifies three of the per-crate
figures that [notes/mutation-testing.md](../mutation-testing.md) summarises. The first half, with
the method and the loom exclusion, is
[regressions-capability-to-dtb](regressions-capability-to-dtb.md).

### `clock_protocol`: 6 survivors, 3 were the loom model, 3 are equivalent and none is a gap

Before: 54 caught, 6 missed, 7 timeouts, 5 unviable (91.0% of viable). After: 54 caught, 3 missed
(95.3%). Nothing was killed and no test was written, and that is the correct outcome. Three
survivors left with the `interleavings::` exclusion recorded under `memory_regions` in
[the first half](regressions-capability-to-dtb.md). The other three cannot differ from the original
under `cargo test`. The rate moved because the measurement stopped counting a file the suite never
compiles. The suite did not get better.

- `spin_hint` replaced by `()`. Under `not(loom)` it is `core::hint::spin_loop()`. That is
  documented as a hint with no effect on program semantics, so removing it changes nothing a host
  test can observe. Under `--cfg loom` it is `yield_now()`, and there it is load-bearing for
  liveness rather than correctness. Loom's scheduler is cooperative, and a spin that never yields
  starves the writer it waits on. That is `script/interleaving-check`'s property, not this suite's.
- `publish`'s `compare_exchange_weak(s, s + 1, ..)` under `*`. `s * 1` is `s`, so the claim
  leaves the sequence even. The odd marker that tells a reader a write is in flight is never set.
  Single-threaded, that is invisible. The publish completes before any read begins, and the final
  sequence is `claimed + 2` either way. This is the "single-threaded blindness" pattern in
  [the recurring patterns](baseline-2026-08-03.md#patterns-that-recur-named-once). It is recorded
  equivalent-under-harness rather than excluded, so it stays visible.
  The gate that owns it kills it, and that was measured. With the mutation applied,
  `script/interleaving-check -p clock_protocol` fails four of its harnesses:
  `a_reader_never_sees_half_a_publish`, `a_racing_reader_sees_an_unrecognised_page_or_a_whole_one`,
  `the_generation_a_reader_sees_matches_the_pair_it_read` and
  `two_writers_serialise_rather_than_corrupt_the_page`. A host test cannot carry a concurrency
  claim. The loom model can, and here it does.
- `policy::decide`'s `proposed_nanos > current_nanos` under `>=`. At equality the two branches
  compute the same thing. The `if` arm tests `0 > MAX_STEP_FORWARD_NANOS` and the `else` arm tests
  `0 > MAX_STEP_BACKWARD_NANOS`. Both constants are non-zero, so both fall through to
  `status::ACCEPTED`. Equivalent for every input, not merely untested.

The 7 timeouts are the seqlock's retry loops, the `dtb` cursor family one level up. They are
`s & 1 != 0` under `==`, `&` under `|` and `^`, and the reader's sequence comparison. Each turns a
bounded retry into one that never exits. The baseline's `clock_protocol` row recorded 7 hangs of 9
survivors for the same reason.

### `swish`: 20 survivors, 16 killed, 4 equivalent

Before: 157 caught, 20 missed, 11 timeouts, 12 unviable (89.4% of viable). After: 173 caught, 4
missed (97.9%). Every survivor was in the shell's printers or its two smallest accessors. That is
what a crate that is mostly rendering should produce.

#### A test that could not fail

`write_found` right-aligns a match count and starts every title in the same column.
`a_search_answer_names_pages_a_reader_can_type` asserted `cols == [APROPOS_TITLE, APROPOS_TITLE]`.
That compares the rendering against the constant it is derived from, which is an identity. Six
mutants lived in that one line, one for every `+` in
`const APROPOS_TITLE: usize = 2 + APROPOS_COUNT + 2 + 28 + 2`. Changing the definition moved both
sides of the assertion together. The fix is the literal 38, which is what a reader at eighty
columns actually gets. A seventh survivor sat next to it: the digit-counting loop's `count / 10`
under `%`. It was invisible because every fixture used a two-digit count. A new test uses a
three-digit one and pins the column under the widest row.

#### The ordinary shape

`write_batch` had no caller in the crate's own tests, so its whole body could be `()`. A sweep
would then have shown a person no set while handing each batch a real one. Making that visible is
the batching lane's whole purpose. `Status::from_code` had no caller either, so it could be
`Default::default()` with two arms deleted. It crosses an atomic cell as a `u64`, so the round trip
is the contract. `write_apropos`'s `offered() > results().len()` under `>=` printed the truncation
tail when nothing was truncated, and no test forbade it.

`Sequence::is_plain` could be a constant `true`. It is the pre-connector shape test, so a `true`
routes `date && wc` down the single-command path and drops everything after the first connector.
Every fixture asked it only of a one-segment line.

One kill is a side effect. `write_duration`'s `(nanos % SEC) / MILLI` under `+` is killed by a new
assertion that the printer is total on every `u64`. That assertion earns its place on its own
merits. The shell hands the printer `end - start` off a counter it does not own, and a clock that
went backwards produces a number nobody chose. It kills the mutant by overflow rather than by
disagreement. The two mutants in the smaller units, where the addition cannot overflow, are
equivalent instead.

#### The four equivalents

- `write_duration`'s `(nanos % MILLI) / MICRO` and `nanos % MICRO` under `+` (2). The fraction
  is printed digit by digit as `t / 100 % 10`, `t / 10 % 10`, `t % 10`, which is `t mod 1000`.
  `MILLI` and `MICRO` are exact multiples of the unit below. So adding one adds exactly 1000 to the
  quotient, and `(t + 1000) mod 1000 == t mod 1000`. The mutants print the same three digits for
  every input that does not overflow, and in these two branches the input cannot.
- `write_refusal`'s `Refusal::NoSuchProgram => {}` arm deleted (1). That arm is reached only
  when the guard above it fails, which is exactly when `spec.prog` is empty. Deleting it sends that
  case to `_`. That arm prints a prefix only `if let Some(p) = Prog::from_name(spec.prog)`, and
  `Prog::from_name(b"")` falls to its `_ => None`. Same output, by two routes.
- `Sequence::is_empty` under a constant `false` (1). The function is documented "never true",
  and the invariant holds. `split` always produces at least one segment, so `self.n == 0` is
  `false` for every value this type can take. `-> true` and `==` under `!=` are killed by the
  assertions added beside `is_plain`. This third one cannot be, because it is what the function
  already does.

The 11 timeouts are hangs, the same loop-control family as `dtb` and `clock_protocol`. They are
`echo`'s word cursor under `-=` and `*=`, `write_found`'s digit loop under `>=`, `pad`'s
`left -= take` under `/=`, and `split`'s segment cursor under `*=`. Each stops the loop advancing.

### `filesystem_protocol`: 59 survivors, 19 killed, 38 equivalent, 2 recorded gaps

Before: 529 caught, 59 missed, 10 timeouts, 47 unviable (90.1% of viable). After: 548 caught, 40
missed (93.3%). The baseline already found this crate dominated by equivalents (36 of 46 under its
old name `fs_proto`). The census's 59 have the same shape. A contract crate is mostly constants and
packing, and most mutants a tool can make there cannot change a value.

#### The nineteen real gaps, four of them witness bits that report nothing

- `fixture::twodir` had no distinctness test at all (5). Five of its six bits could each become
  zero. Two of them are the structural finding `notes/dir-capability.md` records: the endpoint is
  the boundary, witnessed with two live caretakers. A witness bit of zero is a probe that reports
  nothing while its boot passes. Closed by `the_two_grant_bits_are_distinct`, in the shape the
  escape, directory and navigation fixtures already use.
- `fixture::navscape`'s list had gone stale again (3). `BIND_REACHED_TARGET`,
  `BIND_ASCEND_REACHES_REAL_PARENT` and `BIND_STOPS_AT_TRUE_ROOT` (2026-08-30) were never added to
  `the_navigation_bits_are_distinct`. Its body already carries a comment about the previous six
  that were added late. That is rung four of AGENTS.md's ladder failing the way rung four does.
  This time the mutation run noticed rather than a reader. The three are added. The mechanism that
  would stop it recurring is named in milestone 326's handoff rather than built here.
- `fixture::throughput::name` had no caller (9). The whole function survived as `None`, as
  `Some("")` and as `Some("xyzzy")`, plus each of its six arms deleted. The bench boot prints these
  names beside the numbers, so two phases sharing one make two rows a reader cannot tell apart.
  Closed by `every_throughput_phase_tag_has_its_own_name`, which also pins the count against
  `PHASES`.
- `statfs::free_bytes` replaced by `0` (1). Its only assertion was `free_bytes(4096, 0) == 0`,
  which the mutant satisfies. A volume with room would have reported itself full to everything that
  asks before it writes.
- `statfs::encode`'s `out.len() < LEN` under `<=` (1). The tests covered `LEN - 1` and 64 and
  never `LEN` itself. That is the one size a caller sizing its page from the constant would hand it.

#### The thirty-eight equivalents, in four groups

Grouped so a later reader can re-check them by group rather than one at a time.

- Packed wire words whose fields are bit-disjoint (8). `blk::req`, `fs::req` (two),
  `fs::rename_dst`, `grant::spec`, `nameset::encode`, `xattr::spec` and `xattr::reply` all build one
  word as `(field << shift) | (other & mask)`. Each shift clears exactly the bits the mask keeps,
  so `|` and `^` are the same function on those operands. The disjointness is proved, not assumed,
  by `a_handle_never_collides_with_the_opcode_or_length`,
  `a_granted_name_survives_the_two_argument_words` and
  `a_rename_carries_two_directories_and_two_lengths_without_them_bleeding`. `nameset`'s type bit is
  `1 << 7`, against a length the encoder refuses above `grant::MAX_NAME`.
- Unions of distinct single-bit rights (14). `dir::ALL`, `dir::REMOVE_TREE`, `Verb::mutates`'s
  mutating mask, and four `needs_any`/`needs_all` rows in `verb::TABLE`. Every operand is a
  distinct `1 << n`, so `^` is `|`. That the bits are distinct is itself pinned, by
  `undefined_rights_bits_cannot_be_smuggled_into_a_root` and by every non-degenerate `1 << n` in
  `dir` being a caught mutant.
- The attrs witness union (7). `fixture::attrs::EXPECTED` is the eight distinct bits of its own
  module ored together. `the_attribute_bits_are_distinct` is what makes the disjointness a fact.
- `1 << 0` under `>>` (9). `dir::ENUMERATE`, `dirent::IS_DIR`, `grant::READ`, and the first bit
  of six fixture witness sets. Both sides are 1. This is the degenerate case
  [the recurring patterns](baseline-2026-08-03.md#patterns-that-recur-named-once) name, recorded
  rather than excluded so it stays visible if a constant ever moves off zero.

#### Two recorded gaps

These are checkers `cargo test` never runs, the same kind of object as the Kani harnesses excluded
under `timetable` in [the first half](regressions-capability-to-dtb.md). `verb`'s second
`const _: () = { .. }` walks `TABLE` asserting each row sits at its own opcode. Its loop bound
`i < TABLE.len()` survives under `==` and under `>`. Both make the loop body never run, so the
block compiles and checks nothing. No `cargo test` can see this, because the checker is `rustc` and
the evidence of success is that the build happened. The comment above it already says a runtime
test cannot do this job (the three caretakers are `no_std` binaries). It is recorded rather than
excluded because the exclusion would have to be by line, and would hide anything else that lands
there.

The 10 timeouts are hangs, all of them iterator cursors. Four `Iterator::next` implementations were
replaced by `Some(Default::default())`, which never consumes its buffer. Six are `at += ..` under
`*=` in the record walkers and the name packers. A walk that stops advancing loops forever, which
is the tests noticing.
