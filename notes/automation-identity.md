# The automation's own identity

*Name of the App: ratified 2026-09-23 (calef, milestone 128 (the automation gets its own identity)).
**`smelter`**, hence the byline `smelter[bot]`. Refused `nife automation` (the lane's original: it
names the mechanism rather than what the thing is, which is the failure mode `design/naming.md`
warns about), `dynamo` (the maintainer's recommendation, on the grounds that the geodynamo is what
a nickel-iron core actually does; calef chose otherwise), `mantle` (carries "take up the mantle",
which is this milestone's own role-not-person thesis, but sits beside the namesake rather than in
it), `lodestone` (connotes direction-finding rather than doing work), and `cobble` (the mascot; a
byline sharing the mascot's name would confuse the two).*

*Why `smelter` won, stated rather than implied: it is an agent noun, which is this tree's existing
convention for actors (`caretaker`, `undertaker`, `credentialer`, `compositor`), and a smelter is
where iron comes from, which suits the identity that will eventually author this project's
artifacts. The maintainer argued against it on literal process-matching grounds and withdrew the
objection: the tree's actor names are metaphors already, so convention-match is the stronger test.*

*Name of this note: provisional. `automation-identity` is a lane's coinage; `design/naming.md` is
the rule and calef ratifies. The alternatives considered were `github-app.md` (names the vendor's
mechanism rather than what it is for, and this note would survive a move off GitHub only by lying)
and `bot-identity.md` (`bot` is what GitHub calls the badge, not what the thing is). The two secret
names below, `AUTOMATION_APP_ID` and `AUTOMATION_APP_KEY`, are provisional too and are deliberately
left alone rather than renamed to match `smelter`: a rename is a naming decision with extra steps.*

The daily toolchain-bump workflow has to open a pull request that **gets CI**. GitHub's
anti-recursion rule says a pull request opened with a workflow's own ephemeral `GITHUB_TOKEN`
triggers no further workflow runs, so such a pull request sits with every required check stuck on
"Expected", permanently unmergeable. The workflow therefore authenticates as something else.

Today that something else is `TOOLCHAIN_BUMP_PAT`, a fine-grained personal access token on calef's
account. It works. It has two structural flaws: it expires on a personal timer that nobody reading
the workflow can inspect, and it couples the project's automation to one person's account. A
**GitHub App owned by the `crickertech` organization**, installed on `nife`, fixes both. Its
installation tokens are minted fresh per run, so nothing stored expires, and the identity belongs to
the role rather than to the person. That is `needs-architect`'s principle applied to credentials.

**As of 2026-09-23 the App exists**: `smelter`, App ID **5053502**, created by calef under
`crickertech` and installed on `nife` alone, with both secrets stored as **organization secrets
scoped to `nife`**. This note stays written as a procedure rather than as a history, because the
next person to run it will be provisioning a second App or replacing a lost key, and the steps are
the same either way. Where a step has already been taken, it says so.

## What it does not fix

**Commit authorship.** An App's installation token authors the *pull request* and its *comments*,
not the commits inside it. A commit's author is whoever holds the git identity at the moment
`git commit` runs, which in `toolchain-bump.yml` is `github-actions[bot]` by explicit
`git config`, and in a lane's worktree is calef. `Co-Authored-By:` stays the record of who actually
wrote a commit, and that split is honest rather than awkward: the human owns the change, the agent
is named as its co-author, and the conversation around the change is visibly the agent's.

**Anything else that authenticates as calef.** The App covers the workflows that are given its
token. A lane's `gh` calls from a developer machine still run as calef's `gh` login and still
produce pull requests with his byline; that is what the `**Lane:**` line in every body exists to
say in the meantime.

## Why `smelter` has no repository of its own

calef asked, 2026-09-23. **No, and the reason was never scope.** A GitHub App is a registered
identity plus a permission set, held at the organization level; it has no code unless it has a
webhook handler, and this one deliberately has none. Its only artifacts are an App ID and a private
key, both secrets. A repository for it would hold an empty tree and a README pointing back at this
note. **The breakup of the monorepo does not change that**, because an App without a webhook still
has no code to put anywhere.

Two things would change the answer, and either is enough: the App grows a **webhook handler**, a
service receiving events and acting on them, which is real code with its own deploy and tests and
does not belong inside an OS repository; or it grows **custom actions** shared by several
repositories and needing their own release cadence. Note what is *not* on that list. The milestone's
stated reuse, a future workflow copying the two steps from `EXAMPLES` below, is **copied steps
rather than shared code**, and triggers neither. That distinction is the whole reason this is
written down: "reuse is the compounding value" reads like an argument for a repository, and it is
not one.

**What the split does change is where this note lives, and that is an open question with a
trigger rather than a decision to make now.** `smelter` is expected to serve several repositories:
§151 (the goal of the repository split is independent release and third-party programs) is DECIDED,
milestone 39 (repository structure for a loosely-coupled OS) names option C as the destination, and
milestone 120 (the OS becomes `nife`, and the project gets an organization) already put the
manifest in a separate repository, `basalt`. Once `nife` is one
repository among several it stops being the obvious home for organization-wide tooling
documentation, and `basalt` is the plausible destination for this page. **The move happens at the
split, not before**, because today the argument for keeping it here is the stronger one: it sits
beside `toolchain-bump.yml`, the workflow it documents, so the two version together and a change to
that workflow cannot silently invalidate this page. When it moves, §201 (one roadmap until a
citation has to cross) already governs how the citations survive crossing a repository boundary, so
this is an existing framework rather than a new problem.

## Creating the App

Once, by an owner of the `crickertech` organization.

1. Go to **https://github.com/organizations/crickertech/settings/apps** and press **New GitHub App**.
   (The path by clicking: your avatar, **Your organizations**, `crickertech`, **Settings**,
   **Developer settings**, **GitHub Apps**, **New GitHub App**.)
2. **GitHub App name**: type **`smelter`**. Ratified 2026-09-23 by calef; the refusals and the
   reasoning are in the name block at the top of this note.

   **It may be taken.** App names are globally unique across the whole of GitHub, not just this
   organization, and a one-word English name very likely already belongs to somebody. GitHub tells
   you at this screen and nowhere earlier. If it is unavailable, use **`nife smelter`**, which
   renders as `nife-smelter[bot]`. Do not invent a third; bring it back to calef.

   Whichever of the two you get, the byline (`smelter[bot]` or `nife-smelter[bot]`) is what every
   future bump pull request is authored by, so write down which one you took.
3. **Homepage URL**: `https://github.com/crickertech/nife`. It is required and unused.
4. **Webhook**: untick **Active**. Nothing here listens for webhooks, and an inactive webhook is one
   fewer endpoint to secure.
5. **Repository permissions**, exactly two, matching what the PAT carries today and nothing wider:
   - **Contents**: Read and write (push the `toolchain/nightly-bump` branch).
   - **Pull requests**: Read and write (open, retitle and un-draft the proposal).
   Leave every other permission at **No access**. Leave organization and account permissions alone.
6. **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**: **Only on this account**. It is not a public listing.
7. Press **Create GitHub App**.

## Installing it and storing the secrets

8. On the App's settings page, note the **App ID** near the top. For `smelter` it is **5053502**,
   created 2026-09-23 by calef; this step is done. Then **Generate a private key**, which downloads a `.pem` file.
   GitHub never shows it again; a lost key is regenerated rather than recovered.

   **The App ID is not sensitive** and the private key is the only thing here that is. An App ID is
   visible to anyone who can see the App, which is why it can be written down in this note while
   the key never is; finding one in a log or a diff is not an incident.

   **The Client ID on the same page is not used.** `actions/create-github-app-token` authenticates
   with the App ID and the private key; a Client ID exists for OAuth flows, which this App does not
   do. It is deliberately not recorded here, because a value nothing reads is a value that rots.
9. In the left sidebar, **Install App**, then **Install** next to `crickertech`. Choose **Only select
   repositories** and pick **`nife`** alone. **Never "All repositories"**, then or later: add
   repositories to this list as they appear. An App installed on every repository holds authority
   over repositories it has no business in.
10. Store both as **organization** secrets, scoped to exactly the repositories that may read them.
    The commands are:

        gh secret set AUTOMATION_APP_ID  --org crickertech --repos nife --body '5053502'
        gh secret set AUTOMATION_APP_KEY --org crickertech --repos nife < ~/Downloads/smelter.private-key.pem

    **Expect them to fail, and do not fix it the way `gh` suggests.** Unless your shell's token
    already carries organization admin, both return:

        failed to fetch public key: HTTP 403: You must be an org admin or have the
        actions secrets fine-grained permission.
        This API operation needs the "admin:org" scope.

    `gh` offers `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:org`, and it works. **Do not run it.** That
    token is shared by every agent on this machine, and widening it permanently for a one-time task
    grants organization-admin to automation: on 2026-09-23 eight lanes were using that token while
    merging unattended. Least privilege says do the one-time thing by hand. The reasoning is the
    durable part of this paragraph; the clicks below are not.

    **So use the browser.** https://github.com/organizations/crickertech/settings/secrets/actions,
    then **New organization secret**, twice:

    - `AUTOMATION_APP_ID` = `5053502`
    - `AUTOMATION_APP_KEY` = the whole `.pem`, including both the `-----BEGIN` and `-----END` lines
      and the trailing newline.

    Set **Repository access: Selected repositories → `nife`** on both. To get the key into the
    clipboard without opening it in an editor, and to remove it afterwards:

        pbcopy < ~/Downloads/*.private-key.pem
        rm ~/Downloads/*.private-key.pem

    **You cannot confirm this from the shell either**, and that is not something being broken:
    `gh secret list --org crickertech` needs the same `admin:org` scope and returns the same 403 for
    any shell that is not an organization admin's, which is the ordinary case rather than a fault.
    On the browser path the secrets page itself is the confirmation, and the first real proof is the
    identity probe in step 11, once the workflow change has merged.

    **This is the path that was actually used.** Both `smelter` secrets were stored this way by
    calef in the browser on 2026-09-23, after the `gh` commands above returned the 403.

    **Storing them early is safe, and the argument is structural rather than an observation.** Until
    the workflow change has merged, `main`'s `toolchain-bump.yml` contains no reference to
    `AUTOMATION_APP_ID` or `AUTOMATION_APP_KEY` at all, so the secrets cannot reach it whatever they
    contain; the daily bump keeps using the PAT. There is no window in which a half-provisioned App
    can change what the scheduled job does.

    **`--repos nife` is what makes this safe, and it is why this is not the looser choice it looks
    like.** An organization secret naming exactly which repositories may read it has the same blast
    radius today as a repository secret on `nife`, because today that list is `nife`. What it buys
    is the split: `smelter` is expected to serve several repositories once the monorepo is broken up
    (see the section above), and adding one then is editing a list rather than re-provisioning a
    key. Fewer moving parts at no cost now.

    **Never "All repositories."** The list is the mechanism; a secret every repository can read is
    the one shape this buys nothing over.

    **Why a non-secret is stored as a secret**, since the App ID is public and this looks wrong at
    first reading. The workflow uses `AUTOMATION_APP_ID`'s *emptiness* as its inertness switch
    (`if: env.AUTOMATION_APP_ID != ''`), so what is wanted is a per-repository value that is absent
    until someone provisions it, and a secret is the kind of value the workflow already reads. A
    repository or organization **variable** would serve that switch equally and read more honestly,
    since it would not claim to protect something that needs no protection. It is provisioned as a
    secret and stays that way; the alternative is noted here so the next reader does not have to
    work out whether the choice was considered.

    Either way, delete the downloaded `.pem` afterwards. A key sitting in a downloads folder is the
    leak this whole exercise is meant to reduce.

    Both secret names are **provisional** until calef ratifies them. They were deliberately not
    renamed to match `smelter` when the App's name was ratified: a rename is a naming decision with
    extra steps, and `AUTOMATION_*` says what the secrets are for rather than what the App is
    called, which survives the App being renamed.

## Confirming it took, and only then retiring the PAT

11. Run the workflow by hand and read its identity probe:

        gh workflow run toolchain-bump.yml --repo crickertech/nife
        gh run watch "$(gh run list --workflow=toolchain-bump.yml --repo crickertech/nife \
              --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')"

    The **Say which identity this run is authenticating as** step must print
    `identity: the crickertech automation App`. If it prints the PAT line instead, the secrets are
    not visible to the job: check the names, and check that the organization secrets list `nife`
    among the repositories that may read them.

12. **Only after a real bump pull request has been opened by the App and received checks**, retire
    the token, in this order:

        gh secret delete TOOLCHAIN_BUMP_PAT --repo crickertech/nife
        # then revoke the PAT itself at https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta

    Deleting the secret first is what makes the revocation safe: with the secret gone the workflow
    has already fallen through to the App, so revoking the token cannot break a run that is still
    reaching for it. Then delete the PAT rung from `toolchain-bump.yml`'s comment and expressions,
    which is a two-line change and should not be done before this step.

## The one dependency, and why it was taken

**`actions/create-github-app-token`. Approved by calef, 2026-09-23 UTC.** §46 (thin primitives or
whole subsystems) makes taking a dependency a decision rather than a convenience, so it is recorded
rather than merely described. It is **maintained by GitHub** and does exactly one thing, mint an
installation token per run. It is **outside the shipping graph**: it runs in CI and no part of the
OS depends on it, which is the distinction §46 draws. **The alternative was worse**, and this is the
case where §46's "write it yourself" guidance does not apply, because minting the token by hand
means signing a JWT with the private key and exchanging it, in shell, inside a workflow: more code,
in the least testable place this project has, handling a signing key. And **the fallback chain
survives its absence**, since the step is skipped entirely when the App secrets are unset, so the
action is load-bearing for neither the PAT path nor the `github.token` path.

## EXAMPLES

**Read which identity yesterday's bump used.** The probe is the first thing in the job, so this
needs no scrolling:

    gh run list --workflow=toolchain-bump.yml --repo crickertech/nife --limit 1 \
      --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId' \
      | xargs -I{} gh run view {} --repo crickertech/nife --log \
      | grep -A4 'identity:'

**Check whether the bump pull request is actually getting CI**, which is the symptom the whole
mechanism exists to prevent. A bump pull request with one or two checks is a pull request opened by
the ephemeral token:

    gh pr list --head toolchain/nightly-bump --repo crickertech/nife --state all --limit 1 \
      --json number --jq '.[0].number' \
      | xargs -I{} gh pr view {} --repo crickertech/nife \
      --json author,statusCheckRollup \
      --jq '{author: .author.login, checks: (.statusCheckRollup | length)}'

On 2026-09-23 that reported `{"author":"calef","checks":16}`: the PAT path, working.

**Use the same App from a second workflow.** Copy the two steps, nothing else. The fallback chain is
per-workflow on purpose, so a workflow that has no business pushing can take the App's token without
inheriting a reason to keep a PAT beside it:

    env:
      AUTOMATION_APP_ID: ${{ secrets.AUTOMATION_APP_ID }}
    steps:
      - id: app-token
        if: env.AUTOMATION_APP_ID != ''
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v2
        with:
          app-id: ${{ secrets.AUTOMATION_APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.AUTOMATION_APP_KEY }}

## BUGS

- **The private key is still a stored secret.** An App swaps a stored *token* for a stored *signing
  key*. The win is organization ownership and per-run minting, not the absence of a secret. A leaked
  key is revoked in the App's settings, which is at least an organization-level act rather than a
  personal-account one.

- **The App's own permissions are not checked by anything.** Nothing in this tree verifies that the
  installation still holds Contents and Pull requests write, or that it has not quietly been granted
  more. If someone widens them in the web UI, no gate here notices. The identity probe proves the
  token can read the repository; it does not prove the permission set is the one this note describes.

- **The `if: env.AUTOMATION_APP_ID != ''` guard tests presence, not validity.** A secret set to the
  wrong App ID, or a private key that does not match it, takes the App rung and then fails the
  `create-github-app-token` step outright. That is loud rather than silent, which is the right
  failure, but the diagnostic comes from the action rather than from this note.

- **A bot byline changes what author filters see.** Bump pull requests will arrive as
  `smelter[bot]` (or `nife-smelter[bot]`) rather than as `calef`. Nothing in this tree filters pull requests by author
  today, and `helpers/merge-drain.sh` is the file to re-read if that changes.

- **This note cannot tell you when the PAT expires**, and neither can anything else in the
  repository: an Actions secret's value is opaque to every API the project can call, and only the account
  that minted the token can see its expiry at
  https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta. That opacity is not a gap in this note, it is the
  flaw the App removes.
