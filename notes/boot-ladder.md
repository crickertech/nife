# The boot ladder: what a nife boot says, in order, on every architecture

Milestone 268. A boot on this system climbs a fixed ladder, and each rung announces itself with one
line. Those lines are a **contract**: they are what `crates/board_console` matches on a bench and in
CI, and they are what a person reads off a photograph of a monitor when there is no serial port.

```
nife on aarch64 (EL1, MMU off: physical addresses until mmu::init)   <- the console works
...
nife machine: aarch64, 4 processor(s), 256 MiB, 100 Hz               <- discovery finished
nife self-test: 5 of 5 passed                                        <- the kernel works here
...
nife capability shell. naming a resource in a command IS granting it. <- userspace is up
$
```

The heads of those four lines live in one crate, `crates/boot_ladder`, because three binaries agree
on them (the kernel, `swish`, and `board_console`) and AGENTS.md rule 7 says that makes them a
crate. The **tails** carry numbers and are free to improve; a matcher keys on the head only.

## Why the ladder exists at all

Three boot arms had quietly diverged. `machine.rs` was on one architecture; `exceptions::self_test`
was on two; and `Stage::Tour`, the checkpoint the bench tooling relied on to mean "paging, traps,
the timer, the frame allocator, SMP and the scheduler all came up", was printed **inside the RISC-V
arm** of `kernel/src/main.rs` and nowhere else. So on aarch64 and `x86_64` there was no signal on
that channel at all, and a missing marker looks exactly like a slow board.

Milestone 268's lane found a fifth case of the same shape one rung lower: `Stage::Banner` matches
`nife on `, chosen generically so that "a recogniser that only knew the VisionFive 2's would report
a healthy aarch64 or `x86_64` board as never having booted" -- and aarch64 printed no such line at
all. The recogniser had anticipated parity that the thing it read did not have.

**The general lesson, which is worth more than the fix:** a marker that only one architecture prints
is indistinguishable from a marker that never fires, and neither one fails a build. The defence is
a shared definition (the crate) plus a gate that reads the channel (`script/boot-check`).

## The rungs, and who can reach each one

| Rung | Marker | aarch64 | riscv64 | `x86_64` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Banner` | `nife on ` | yes | yes | yes |
| `Machine` | `nife machine: ` | yes | yes | yes |
| `SelfTest` | `nife self-test: ` | yes | yes | yes |
| `Tour` | `nife: the capability core runs on ` | no | yes | no |
| `Prompt` | `nife capability shell` | yes | yes | yes |

`Tour` is deliberately **one architecture's rung** and is documented as one. Levelling it up would
mean giving two architectures a marker for a demonstration tour they do not have; levelling it down
would delete riscv64's, which is the trap milestone 268's block warns about. The rungs that replace
it for every tool are `Machine` and `SelfTest`, which every architecture reaches.

`Prompt` needs an **archive** on every architecture, because the shell that prints it is loaded out
of one. It was unreachable on `x86_64` until 2026-09-19: DECISIONS §149 (may the kernel answer on
an endpoint) settled how `swish` gets a console there, milestone 299 (the x86 port-range
capability) built the capability that makes `console` a userspace driver on that machine, and
milestone 182 (x86_64's own interactive-boot entry point) added the `script/swish-check` leg that
types at it. `script/boot-check` asserts this rung on all three architectures since the same day.

## The machine description: the same questions, not the same lines

`kernel/src/main.rs`'s `print_machine_description` answers eight questions on every architecture:
**processors, memory, console, interrupt controller, timer rate, initrd, PCIe window, IOMMU.** One
of these machines has ACPI and two have a device tree, so each answers in its own vocabulary: a
GICv2's distributor and CPU interface, a PLIC and this hart's S-mode context, a local-APIC/IO-APIC
pair. What is **not** allowed is a blank. An architecture that cannot answer says so in words,
because a missing line and a line nobody wrote look the same in a photograph.

It ends with `nife machine: ` rather than beginning with it, deliberately: reaching that line means
the whole block printed, which is the claim a ladder rung should make. A header would only mean the
block started.

Nothing in the body may be gated on a boot-mode feature, and `script/lint` checks that. The reason
is `xenon`: at first light on that machine there was no serial console this project could read, so
these lines *were* the transcript.

## The self-test: it reports, it does not gate

`kernel/src/self_test.rs` runs five checks between the description and the hand-off: `exceptions`
(a breakpoint is caught and stepped over), `mapping` (a fresh page is mapped, written, read back and
unmapped at an address computed from this machine's own RAM), `frames` (one frame out of the
allocator and back, with the accounting agreeing at both ends), `timer` (the counter advances and a
tick interrupt arrives), `scheduler` (a spawned kernel thread runs and carries its captured state).

**A failure prints and the boot carries on.** calef, 2026-09-09: *"I could see building tools to
diagnose what broke but we can only run them if there is a prompt"*. A machine you cannot log into
is a machine you cannot fix.

That is exactly why the verdict has to be read by something other than a person. The boot tour's own
checks have printed `FAILED:` and carried on since they were written, and nothing ever read those
either; that is how a checkpoint reachable on one of three architectures hid for months.

## EXAMPLES

Boot all three, require a green verdict, and require each one to reach a `swish` prompt (a `local`
row in `script/ci-build`'s table, so the no-argument path runs it before a push and CI's test job
names it). About 26 seconds against a warm target directory:

```
$ script/boot-check
boot-check (aarch64): reached shell prompt (3867 bytes in 2.9s)
boot-check (aarch64): nife machine: aarch64, 4 processor(s), 256 MiB, 100 Hz
boot-check (aarch64): nife self-test: 5 of 5 passed
...
boot-check: every architecture climbed the ladder to a shell prompt, and the self-test verdict on
the way was green
```

One architecture:

```
$ script/boot-check --arch riscv64
```

Prove the gate has teeth, by making one check fail and requiring the run to come back **red**:

```
$ script/boot-check --inject
boot-check (aarch64): nife self-test: 3 of 5 passed, 2 FAILED: exceptions timer
...
boot-check: every architecture's self-test verdict came back RED, as the injection asked
```

Watch a real board over a serial cable and stop as soon as it has self-tested:

```
$ cargo xtask board-console --port /dev/cu.usbserial-0001 --until selftest
board-console: reached self-test verdict (6862 bytes in 12.4s)
board-console: machine: nife machine: riscv64, 4 processor(s), 8192 MiB, 100 Hz
board-console: self-test: nife self-test: 5 of 5 passed
```

Replay a capture through the same recogniser, which is how every marker in it is tested:

```
$ cargo xtask board-console --replay target/boot-check-riscv64.log --until selftest
```

## BUGS

- **Closed 2026-09-14: "Nothing proves an architecture ran the *right* five checks."**
  `boot_ladder::SELF_TEST_CHECKS` is the set, one list for every architecture and the recogniser;
  the kernel names a listed check that never ran and `board_console` fails a verdict whose total is
  not the list's length. What remains is that changing the set is one edit, which review judges.
- **Closed 2026-09-14: "A self-test can hang the boot."** `timer` and `scheduler` read through
  `self_test::Counter`, which reports a counter that read one value a million times running, and
  `timer` spins rather than sleeping. What remains is a check whose *operation* never returns, which
  needs a watchdog `kernel/src/self_test.rs` does not own and says so.
- **The prompt rung is the shell's banner, not the `$ `.** `crates/boot_ladder`'s own BUGS has the
  reason. So `script/boot-check` proves `swish` started and printed, not that a prompt was offered
  or that anything could be typed at it. `script/swish-check` makes that stronger claim by typing.
- **The injected leg is not in CI.** `--inject` rebuilds three kernels for one boolean, and what it
  proves is a property of the gate rather than of the change under test. Run it by hand when the
  self-test or the recogniser changes. This is rung four of AGENTS.md's ladder and it is said out
  loud rather than implied.
- **The riscv64 and `x86_64` arms narrate their own bring-up and the description then repeats some
  of it.** Noise rather than a defect, and trimming it is not free: those arms' lines are what a
  `test` or `bench` boot has instead, since the description is compiled out of both. It is milestone
  409 (`design/roadmap/409-one-machine-description-not-two.md`).
- **The wordings are provisional** (milestone 268). They are contracts, so they are an architect's
  under AGENTS.md's *move fast on what can be undone* tenet; a lane ships one and says so rather
  than waiting.
