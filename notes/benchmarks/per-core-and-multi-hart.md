# Per-core magnitudes and the multi-hart bench

*An appendix to [`notes/benchmarks.md`](../benchmarks.md), which carries the current numbers and is written so a reader can act without opening this file. This one holds why `--real` is single-hart, the 2026-07-29 refresh, and the `smp_*` placement numbers, with the dates, tables and corrections behind them. Name: ratified 2026-09-24 (calef); [the naming record](README.md) holds it.*

## The one bench that is legitimately multi-hart: §28 (SMP placement)

Every primitive benchmark is hart-pinned, and has to be. The icount instrument boots `-smp 1`
because under `-icount` all vCPUs share one virtual clock, and an idle hart's `wfi` jumps that clock
forward (the 2026-07-28 finding in [the icount drift appendix](icount-drift-and-provenance.md)). So
the deterministic suite measures per-core path length and is blind, by construction, to §28's whole
job: spreading work across the four harts. The `smp_*` benches
(`kernel/src/bench.rs::smp_throughput`) are the one measurement that shows it, and their method
differs on purpose.

Run them with `script/bench --real --smp` (HVF, 4 harts). Plain `--real` is single-hart on purpose
(per-core magnitudes; see the refresh below), so `smp_throughput` self-skips there.

### They never gate, and never touch `bench/baseline-aarch64.txt`

Two structural reasons. First, they run only when `online_count() > 1`, which is only the
`--real --smp` boot. Under the icount instrument (`-smp 1`) and the default single-hart `--real` run,
`smp_throughput` returns immediately. So no `smp_*` line is emitted there and the committed baseline
never sees them (verified: `--check` output has no `smp_*` rows). Second, a wall-clock throughput
number is not defined under `-icount` (one shared clock). TCG also serialises all vCPUs onto one
host thread, so there is no real parallelism to measure. Only HVF gives each core its own counter and
genuine concurrent execution. These are statistical HVF magnitudes read by a human with loose
bounds, like the other `--real` numbers, not a tick baseline.

### Two workloads, which tell opposite and both-true stories

| bench | workload | one batch |
|---|---|---|
| `smp_compute_*` | N independent CPU-bound grinders, no syscalls | `solo` = 1 worker; `all` = 16 workers, each the same fixed grind |
| `smp_pipe_*` | N independent synchronous IPC ping-pong pairs | `solo` = 1 pair; `all` = 16 pairs, each 2000 round trips |

The scaling factor for either is the `solo` throughput divided by the `all` throughput. Read it from
the totals (`iters / ticks`), not from the coarse `ns/iter` column. `smp_cores` records the ceiling
(4 on this boot).

### Compute scales, ~3.5x on 4 cores: the §28 placement win

HVF, release, min-of-4 batches, five boots:

```
smp_compute_solo   ~8,886 ticks / 300,000 iters      (one core's grind rate)
smp_compute_all   ~40,000 ticks / 4,800,000 iters    (16x the work, across the machine)
```

Sixteen workers is sixteen times the work. Run one at a time it would take
`16 x 8,886 = 142,176` ticks; it finishes in ~40,000, a 3.5x speedup (≈89% of the 4x ceiling). The
lost ~11% is expected. 16 does not divide into 4 waves cleanly (the last wave runs four workers where
earlier waves were full), and spawn, reap and the barrier cost something. A CPU-bound worker makes no
cross-core wake once placed, so the host keeps every busy vCPU on a real core. What is left to
measure is placement filling the machine, which no hart-pinned primitive can show.

### Synchronous IPC pipelines do not scale under HVF, and the reason is the host

Same conditions:

```
smp_pipe_solo   ~2,900 ticks / 2,000 rtts    (~59 ns/round trip, one warm core, all local)
smp_pipe_all  ~250,000 ticks / 32,000 rtts   (~322 ns/round trip aggregate)
```

The aggregate per round trip is slower than a single pair's, a ~0.18x "speedup". The cause is a
virtualization property. A single pair, with the other three cores idle and the main thread blocked,
co-locates by §28's local-wake rule. It does every rendezvous on one warm core with no cross-core
traffic, so it runs at the `ipc_rtt` rate (~59 ns). Placement scatters sixteen pairs across the
cores. Whenever placement or stealing splits a pair across two cores, its next rendezvous is a
cross-core wake: an SGI to a vCPU the host descheduled because the guest looked idle a moment
earlier. Waking a descheduled vCPU costs host reschedule latency the co-located pair never pays. So
the IPC-heavy parallel workload spends its time in HVF's wake path, not in the kernel.

The icount suite is pinned to one hart, and a same-machine seL4 number is deferred to real hardware,
for the same reason: the instrument underneath sets the ceiling, not nife. On real silicon with four
dedicated cores and no descheduling, the pipelines should scale the way compute does here. Measuring
that is a real-hardware follow-up (milestone 16 (real hardware and IOMMU-backed driver isolation)), and the bench already reports it.

### The correction that made the solo baseline honest

It is the same class of error as the smp=4 counter bug. The first version had the main thread
busy-yield on a done counter instead of blocking on a `RECV`. A runnable main plus the pair is three
threads the scheduler scatters. So even the solo pair took cross-core wakes and clocked ~60x slower
than `ipc_rtt`'s identical pair, and the derived scaling came out superlinear (greater than the core
count), which is not physical. Blocking the main thread (the `ipc_rtt` shape) fixed it: solo returned
to the ~59 ns rate and scaling fell back under the ceiling. A non-physical speedup is a bug in the
measurement, never a win; it went in the bin, not the baseline.

## 2026-07-29: real-magnitude refresh on settled main (HVF, release), and the per-core default

The recorded `--real` magnitudes predated a wave of seven decisions, so they were rerun on settled
`main`. The wave:

- §22 (Rust `std` on the native ABI) and §26 (the fault endpoint)
- §27 (the filesystem service) and §28, the placement decision above
- §30 (the DMA boundary is proved for descriptors) and §31 (the foreign-language seam)
- §32 (a supervisor may collect a corpse without being able to build one)

Two harness changes came out of it.

### `--real` is single-hart by default

A primitive magnitude is a per-core number, and the cross-OS table reads it that way (against Linux
`fork`, lmbench, seL4, all per-core). The wave made the default `--real` boot `-smp 4`. There the
reap-heavy primitives inflate and go noisy under cross-core reap lag unrelated to per-core cost.
`spawn_el0` reads ~4.4 us on one hart and ~13.6 us on four, and swings widely there. `spawn_reap` is
~1.3 us on one hart and 11-160 us on four. So `--real` now pins `-smp 1` like the icount instrument,
for the same reason, and `--real --smp` boots the whole machine for the throughput bench above. The
single-hart run is the per-core signal; the four-hart run is for scaling.

### The refreshed per-core numbers

HVF, `--release`, `-smp 1`, medians of 5 boots, ns/iter:

| primitive | 2026-07-29 (per-core) | previously recorded | what moved, and why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `null_syscall` (EL0) | ~27 | ~27 | unchanged |
| `ipc_rtt_el0` (EL0) | ~361 | ~337 | **+7%**, the milestone-22 §26 mailbox widening 3->5 words; matches the icount +5% exactly, real and expected |
| `ctx_switch` (EL0, round trip) | ~112 | ~28/switch (~56 rt) | ~29 ns/switch derived, unchanged |
| `map_el0` (mechanism, aliased) | ~92 | ~91 | unchanged |
| `map_new` (provision + map) | ~470 | ~524 | within run-to-run noise; still zeroing-bound |
| `spawn_el0` (EL0, build+run+reap+reclaim) | ~4,400 | ~7,700 | **lower**, see below |
| `spawn_reap` (kernel-side) | ~1,300 | ~2,800 (debug) | lower; the old figure was a debug single-run |
| `ipc_rtt` (kernel-side) | ~50 | ~705 (debug) | the gap is the debug->release tax, not a change |
| `call_reply` (kernel-side) | ~66 | ~886 (debug) | same, debug->release |
| `yield_switch` (kernel-side) | ~32 | ~437 (debug) | same, debug->release |
| `coremark` (per iteration) | ~8,700 | n/a | pure compute, invariant across the wave (the smp=4 artifact check) |

`ipc_rtt_el0` is the one clean, real movement: +7%. The icount baseline put it at +5%. Both are the
§26 fault-message carrier widening the mailbox from three words to five, so every send and recv
copies five. Small, expected, paid for a feature, and the two instruments agree.

`spawn_el0` reads lower (~4.4 us) than the recorded ~7.7 us, and this is not a path-length speedup.
The icount path length for spawn_el0 rose ~11% over the wave (the §31 SPLIT rights inheritance).
Spawn is the noisiest primitive, since it reaps a child every iteration. The recorded 7.7 us was a
single sample on a busier machine; the settled per-core median is ~4.4 us with low variance, and
~13.6 us at four harts. Read 4.4 us as the refreshed stable per-core figure, not as spawn getting
faster. The cross-OS story is unchanged: still faster than Linux `fork`+`exit`, with the "a
capability process is a lighter object than a Unix one" caveat.

*Note, 2026-09-24: ~4.4 us remains the latest measured HVF figure for `spawn_el0`. A later
paragraph derived ~8.2 us from the superseded 7.7; see the correction in
[the cross-OS appendix](cross-os-primitives.md).*

Nothing here needed a path investigated. The only structural change was the harness (`--real` boots
one hart now). The one code-attributable movement, `ipc_rtt_el0` +7%, is the mailbox, and both
instruments agree on it.
