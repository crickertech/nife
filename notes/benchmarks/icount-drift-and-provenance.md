# icount drift, and what a baseline was read against

*An appendix to [`notes/benchmarks.md`](../benchmarks.md), which carries the current numbers and is written so a reader can act without opening this file. This one holds why the tripwire is 10%, the toolchain and emulator stamps, and the 2026-07-28 `-smp 4` artefact, with the dates, tables and corrections behind them. Name: ratified 2026-09-24 (calef); [the naming record](README.md) holds it.*

## What the icount instrument cannot see

TCG models no caches, no TLB and no branch prediction. So a change that is count-neutral but
cache-hostile passes `--check` silently. The roadmap block states this limit too. The `--real`
numbers are the net that catches what counts cannot, read by a human rather than a gate.

## A correction: the counts drift across builds, so "attributable to the commit" was too strong

The original milestone-21 note said a count change "is a change in a code path, attributable to the
commit that made it." Building the EL0 primitive suite disproved the attribution half. Milestone 25 (cross-OS performance comparison)
folds in the fix.

icount is deterministic per binary (byte-identical runs, verified twice). It is not stable across
different binaries. Adding the `null_syscall_el0` bench, which touches no other benchmark's code,
moved `yield_switch` -7% and `ipc_rtt` +1.8% at the same time. Two controlled facts pin the
mechanism:

- A dead function added to `bench.rs` moved nothing. So it is not raw code layout (addresses do not
  change instruction counts anyway).
- The shifts are non-uniform and opposite in sign across benchmarks. So it is not a common-mode
  offset that could be subtracted out.

What is left is the compiler's whole-crate decisions. Adding live code that calls into shared
functions (`sched::spawn`, `user::run`) changes inlining and monomorphization elsewhere. So other
functions' executed-instruction counts move, each its own way. The session's drift also held a real
increase from the 19f object-capability refactor, which genuinely grew the scheduler and thread hot
paths. The instrument cannot separate that from the codegen churn.

### The fix (milestone 25)

`--check` was demoted from a 2% gate to a coarse 10% tripwire. It still catches a gross regression
("you 3x'd IPC"). It no longer pretends to attribute a 3% wiggle to the commit in front of it. The
`--real` medians, read by a human, are the fine signal, and a few-percent codegen shuffle is already
in their noise.

Ideas not taken, and why:

- Pinning hot-path layout: fragile, and layout was not the cause.
- Per-operation deltas that cancel fixed overhead: the shift is in the measured body, not the fixed
  overhead, so it would not cancel.
- Common-mode subtraction: the shifts are not common-mode.

### The floors name the nightly they were read against (2026-09-21)

A toolchain bump revalues every number in `bench/baseline-*.txt`, and no commit is responsible for
it. icount counts guest instructions, and a new compiler emits different ones for the same source.
On 2026-09-15 the pin went to `nightly-2026-09-15` with the floors left alone, and most of the
headroom went with it. The tree was bumped again to `nightly-2026-09-20` before anybody acted, and
the drift then happened to evaporate. Measured 2026-09-21, the worst margin was +0.02% on aarch64
and +2.27% on x86_64, with riscv64's `rfence_self` 7.49% faster than its floor (see
[the `rfence_self` appendix](rfence-self-row.md)).

So each baseline carries a `# toolchain: nightly-YYYY-MM-DD` line. `cargo xtask bench --save`
writes it from the pin rather than from whichever compiler happens to be running. `script/lint`
fails when that line and `rust-toolchain.toml` disagree. It can only fire on a branch that raises
the pin: that is where the delta is caused, where a human is already deciding something, and where
re-recording is attributable. A general staleness check would have failed branches that caused
nothing.

Auto-re-saving on a bump is refused (calef, 2026-09-21). The refusal is written where somebody would
reach for it, in `script/toolchain-bump` and `.github/workflows/toolchain-bump.yml`. A floor that
tracks the compiler by construction moves by exactly as much as a nightly moved the kernel. A
nightly that made this kernel slower would then report nothing, and catching that is most of what
the tripwire is for.

Who re-records, and whether the bump then waits, changed on 2026-09-24. calef ruled:

> Our default should be to merge and we should only block it if there is a compelling reason to.

The refusal above stands: a person or a maintainer session still reads the delta and writes the `--why`. But that is
not a hold. Once the floors are re-recorded and CI is green, the bump merges like any other pull
request. It is held with `needs-architect` only for a compelling reason: a changed proof or
falsification result, or a bench move beyond tolerance. A lint silenced only by a crate- or
workspace-level allow counts too, as do a changed test output and a compile break too large to fix
small. The list lives in
`.github/workflows/toolchain-bump.yml`'s header.

To separate the compiler from the code, compare the bump pull request's bench job with the
merge-group bench run of its base commit: same tree, old nightly. `--check` alone compares against
the floors, which also carry whatever drift `main` accumulated since the last save. The first bump
under the ruling, `nightly-2026-09-24` (PR #1250), is the worked example. On identical source,
aarch64 and x86_64 did not move at all and riscv64 `ipc_rtt` got 0.58% faster. The x86_64 floors
were already 0.4% to 2.3% under the tree on `main`.

### The emulator is the other half of the same fact (2026-09-21)

An icount count is a function of two things: the compiler that emitted the instructions and the
emulator that counted them. The section above made the first a record. The `rfence` lane found the
second while chasing a benchmark that had apparently got 7.49% faster. `.qemu-version` pinned
11.0.2, this machine had run 11.1.1 since 2026-08-28, and `script/bench` never checked. Every
committed baseline had been measured against an emulator nobody recorded and nothing verified.
`script/qemu-check`'s own warning text asserted the baselines "were recorded against" the pin, which
was an assumption stated as fact.

The stamp records the emulator that ran, not the pin. `rustup` resolves the compiler from
`rust-toolchain.toml`, so there the pin and the thing that ran are one fact by construction (the one
escape, `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`, is named in the code). Nothing resolves QEMU from `.qemu-version`. It is
a wish about the machine, and on 2026-08-28 the machine stopped granting it. So `cargo xtask bench
--save` asks the binary, and when the answer differs from the pin the line says both.

The check compares the stamp against the emulator in front of it. It lives in `--check` rather than
in `script/lint`, because there is no emulator in a repository. Two comparisons were available:

| compared against | what it would do |
|---|---|
| `.qemu-version` | fails any baseline truthfully recorded off-pin, so it forbids the file from stating the truth, and still passes a comparison run on a third version |
| **the emulator this run used** | asks the only apples-to-apples question there is: is the counter reading this floor the counter that produced it |

`unrecorded` is a truthful answer and does not fail, the posture milestone 115 (the names that were
refused) takes for names. Every baseline carried it on 2026-09-21, because nobody had written down
which QEMU produced those counts. The check fires at full strength from the first honest `--save`
onward, and never on a number nobody stamped.

A failure does not mean "upgrade something". A re-record and the pin have to be settled in the same
commit, because CI builds the pinned emulator (`script/ci-qemu`) and reads these floors on it. Which
version to run was left as an architect's call.

*Correction, 2026-09-24: both open points above have since closed. `e9c8723c3` (2026-09-21) pinned
`.qemu-version` to 11.1.1, the version this machine had been running. All three
`bench/baseline-*.txt` now carry `# qemu: 11.1.1` rather than `unrecorded`. Milestone 302 (a
baseline records what it was saved against) merged on 2026-09-23 (#1126): each baseline also carries
a `# why:` line, and `script/bench --save` requires `--why "<reason>"`. The current files' `# why:`
line reads "unrecorded, predates milestone 302", because the saves they hold came before it.*

## 2026-07-28: the day `--check` failed on every primitive, and why it was the harness

Roughly eight merges landed on `main` in one day. They were milestone 32 (a real filesystem) phase 1 block writes, 16b
IOMMU, 28 line discipline, 27 std, 30 net in three stages, 31 capability shell, and 22 phase A's
fault endpoint with the DESTROY force-kill amendment. None ran `bench --check`, because bench is not in
the `script/test` gate. When the dust settled, `--check` failed IMPROVED on four primitives and
REGRESSED on two, all far past the 10% tripwire:

| primitive | old baseline (smp=4) | HEAD (smp=4) | reported delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| call_reply | 1,876,614 | 965,679 | **-49%** |
| spawn_reap | 1,769,595 | 175,185 | **-90%** |
| ctx_switch | 6,308,105 | 3,648,857 | **-42%** |
| ipc_rtt_el0 | 21,364,834 | 11,950,853 | **-44%** |
| map_el0 | 408,897 | 575,752 | **+41%** |
| spawn_el0 | 3,132,783 | 3,633,897 | **+16%** |

Improvements that large and that uniform are suspicious; eight unrelated merges do not hand a -90%
on spawn for free. Bisecting the merge points, one deterministic icount run each, showed the tell at
once. `coremark`, which is pure compute and touches no OS primitive, moved +63% at the
capability-shell merge (20.9M to 34.1M ticks). `spawn_reap` did not creep, it jumped: 1.77M at the
base, 172k three merges later, 3.5M one merge after that. A compute loop cannot move 63% because a
kernel merged a socket API.

### Root cause: the aarch64 icount bench ran `-smp 4`, and CNTVCT is global under icount

The bench reads `CNTVCT_EL0` (`arch::timer::now()`) around each loop. Under `-icount shift=0` all
vCPUs share one deterministic virtual-instruction clock. So that counter advances with the global
instruction stream across every hart, not just the core running the benchmark. The aarch64 runner
defaults to `-smp 4` (`NIFE_SMP:-4`, matching the SMP tests), and the bench never overrode it.

Each measured window therefore silently counted three other harts' idle loops. Worse, under
`-icount` an idle secondary hart parked in `wfi` jumps virtual time forward to the next timer tick.
That dumps a large quantized lump of ticks into whatever window happens to be open. Add the
load-balanced spawner, and the count for `spawn_reap` or `ipc_rtt_el0` becomes a function of how
four harts interleaved, which any code change perturbs. The result is deterministic per binary, so
`--check` "worked" and the old baseline looked stable. It was the machine's four-hart idle pattern,
sampled, not the primitive's path length.

The proof is a re-run at `-smp 1`. With a single hart the counter advances only with the bench
thread, and the same commits that swung wildly at `-smp 4` go flat:

| primitive | baseline | iommu(16b) | cap-shell(31) | HEAD | smp=1 spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| coremark | 20,914,947 | 20,913,678 | 20,913,678 | 20,913,678 | ~0.006% |
| spawn_reap | 166,860 | 170,952 | 170,952 | 175,890 | +5.4% |
| ctx_switch | 2,664,204 | 2,679,734 | 2,680,270 | 2,685,272 | +0.8% |
| ipc_rtt_el0 | 9,603,751 | 9,694,986 | 10,005,385 | 10,101,111 | +5.2% |
| call_reply | 956,768 | 956,769 | 956,893 | 963,080 | +0.6% |
| spawn_el0 | 1,574,632 | 1,609,770 | 1,750,084 | 1,754,438 | +11% |
| ipc_rtt | 861,095 | 864,935 | 861,346 | 922,720 | +7.2% |
| null_syscall | 427,706 | 457,705 | 457,705 | 457,705 | +7.0% |

`coremark` is invariant to five decimal places, the sanity check the smp=4 run failed. The `-42%` to
`-90%` improvements and the `+41%` regression were entirely the smp=4 artefact. They attribute to no
merge's code: the old baseline froze one sample of the four-hart interleaving and that day's merges
reshuffled it.

### This was a known bug on one ISA and an unfixed one on the other

The riscv bench path already pinned `NIFE_SMP=1`, with a comment describing this exact failure ("a
`wfi` jumps virtual time to the next timer tick, inflating the spawn primitives to timer-quantized
nonsense"). That fix landed with the riscv icount bench (commit 494514b) and was never mirrored to
aarch64. So the aarch64 icount instrument had measured four-hart noise since milestone 21 (performance measurement).

The fix is one line: the aarch64 icount path now sets `NIFE_SMP=1` like riscv, and the baseline is
re-saved at single hart. Real per-core magnitudes still come from `--real` (HVF). There each core
keeps its own counter and parallel harts do not inflate elapsed time, so SMP is not a confound.

### What actually moved, once the noise is gone

At `-smp 1` every primitive is within ~11% of the old baseline's intent, and the real movement is
small and mostly explained:

| primitive | true delta (smp=1) | cause | assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| ipc_rtt | +7.2% | the IPC mailbox widened 3 words to 5 (milestone 22 (trusted init) §26 (the fault endpoint), the fault-message carrier); every `ipc_send`/`ipc_recv` now copies five words via `wide()` | real, small, expected; the step lands exactly at the M22 merge (cap-shell 861k to HEAD 923k) |
| ipc_rtt_el0 | +5.2% | same mailbox widening, on the EL0 path | real, small |
| spawn_el0 | +11% | the M31 SPLIT rights-inheritance change (child budget gets full delegable rights); spawn_el0 does a SPLIT + retype per iteration | real, small; the step lands at the cap-shell merge (1.61M to 1.75M) |
| null_syscall | +7.0% | one-step at the blk-write/iommu merges, then flat; kernel layout/codegen drift in the syscall entry path, not a redesign | codegen drift, in the build-to-build drift documented above |
| spawn_reap, map_new, map_el0, call_reply, ctx_switch | +0.6% to +5% | whole-crate codegen churn across eight merges | codegen drift, expected and sub-tripwire |
| coremark, yield_switch | ~0% | pure compute / tight kernel yield, no structural change | invariant, as they should be |

No merge needed reverting and no path needed investigating. The only defect was the harness. No
bench had an elided loop or an early exit; the fiction was the counter, reading four harts where the
benchmark meant one. The new smp=1 baseline is the first aarch64 icount baseline that measures the
primitive rather than the machine, and it now agrees in shape with the riscv one.
