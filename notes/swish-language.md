# `swish` the language: quoting, sequencing, and what an exit status can say

*Milestone 67. `crates/grant_plan/src/word.rs`, `crates/grant_plan/src/line.rs`,
`crates/swish/src/sequence.rs`, `crates/swish/src/lib.rs`, `components/src/swish.rs`,
`kernel/src/user/language_tests.rs`, `xtask`'s `SHELL_CHECK_SCRIPT`. Read notes/pipes.md first if
you have not: this is the layer above its operators, and it reuses their vocabulary.*

`swish` had composition, grants, navigation and globbing, and no scripting language at all. This
milestone adds the three things that were missing and settles the one design fork inside them.

- **Quoting.** `'...'` and `"..."`, which decide what a *word* is, and in this shell a word is often
  the thing you are handing over.
- **Sequencing.** `;`, `&&` and `||`, outside everything else on the line.
- **Exit status.** `$?`, and the decision about what a status means **when the thing that failed was
  a refusal rather than an error**.

Two rows of the roadmap's table were already done when this was written: `>>` and `2>` landed with
milestone 50's later work on 2026-08-03. See notes/pipes.md.

## Quoting is not a convenience, it is an authority gap

**A file called `my notes.txt` could not be named.** In a shell whose whole thesis is that naming a
resource *is* granting it, a resource you cannot name is a resource you cannot grant. So the gap was
in the authority surface, not in the ergonomics, and that is why it is a milestone rather than
polish.

```text
$ echo hello world > "my notes.txt"
$ wc < "my notes.txt"
  1 2 12
$ wc "my notes.txt"
  1 2 12
```

The third line is what makes the pair a claim rather than an assertion. `wc "my notes.txt"` is the
same designation with the operator left out (milestone 31's headline), so if the two disagreed, one
of them opened something else. Before this milestone neither line existed: the `>` would have
written to a file called `"my`, and `wc` would have been handed two unplaceable tokens.

### Quoting delimits a word. It never rewrites one.

This is the decision the whole design turns on, and it is forced by something real.

Every token in this shell is a **slice of the line you typed**. Nothing is copied and nothing is
reassembled, which is what lets a shell with no allocator hand a name straight to the grant planner,
and it is why `line::split` can keep a stage's command text as a slice rather than rebuilding it. A
backslash escape would have to *remove* a byte from the middle of a word, and a word with a byte
removed is not a slice of anything. So:

| | |
|---|---|
| `'...'` and `"..."` | wrap a **whole** word; the word is the span between them |
| `\` | an ordinary byte in a name. There is no escape |
| `a"b c"d` | `Refusal::PartlyQuoted`. Two pieces are never joined |
| `'it''s'` | the same refusal. Write it `"it's"` |
| `'unclosed` | `Refusal::UnclosedQuote`, and the whole line is refused |

What that buys is worth the corners it costs: **what is between the quotes is exactly what is
designated, byte for byte.** There is no rewriting step between what you typed and what moves, so a
preview and a grant cannot come to disagree about what a name is.

### What quoting does and does not change about authority

It changes **what is designated**, and that is the whole list:

- It changes a word's boundaries, so a name with a space, a `>` or a `|` in it can be named at all.
  That is new authority only in the sense that a resource you could not name was a resource you
  could not grant.
- It **suppresses pattern expansion**, which is a *narrowing*. `rm "*.txt"` designates one name
  spelled `*.txt`; `rm *.txt` designates the set.
- It **stops a token being an option**, which is the sharpest edge here. `rm "-r"` names a file
  called `-r`. Reading it as the flag that widens a directory grant from "may take a name out of
  this directory" to "may walk everything under it" would be the loudest possible version of a typo
  becoming a capability transfer.

It changes nothing else. There is no quoting form that widens a grant, none that reaches a
capability the same word unquoted could not, and none that skips a manifest check: `"secret.txt"` is
planned against exactly what `secret.txt` is planned against. Quoting is a fact about the **line**,
and authority here is a fact about what the shell **holds**.

The narrowing is visible before anything moves, which is the pairing `echo` and `caps` exist for:

```text
$ echo "*.txt"
*.txt
$ caps wc "my notes.txt"
  wc would grant the new process, and nothing else:
    cap 0  endpoint  result   report its answer back
    output   this shell's result endpoint (it reads the bytes and prints them)
    input    my notes.txt  (this shell reads it and streams it in; the program
             holds an endpoint, not a file)
    arg    (none)
  reading the command is reading its whole authority.
```

### `'` and `"` are the same today, and saying which will differ is not this milestone's call

Both forms are literal. The difference POSIX draws between them is `$` expansion, and this shell has
no variables (milestone 47 owns them, and studies them as "the same question wearing a string
costume"). Inventing the distinction now would be inventing it rather than discovering it, which is
the argument milestone 50 made about `InputSpec` and got right by waiting.

What they do differ in today is which byte they let you write: `echo "it's"` and `echo 'say "hi"'`
both work and neither would with one form.

### Where the quote state machine lives, and why there is one of it

Three scanners need to know whether a byte is quoted and none of them can share a tokenizer:
`grant_plan::tokenize` splits on whitespace, `grant_plan::line::split` splits on `>`, `<` and `|`,
and `swish::sequence::split` splits on `;`, `&&` and `||`. What they have in common is a two-bit
state machine, so that is what is shared: `grant_plan::word::Cursor`, whose `step` answers "is this
byte bare".

The other half is `word::read`, which takes the quotes off one whole token. Keeping the two apart is
what lets one place refuse `a"b"` for every scanner: the tokenizer's job is where a token *ends* and
`read`'s is what it *means*.

## Sequencing splits outermost, and that is a decision

`caps`, `time` and `xargs` are prefix words whose operand is **a whole command line**, which is why
`swish::route` answers them before the line is split on `|`. Sequencing has the opposite need:
`time a && b` must time `a` and then run `b`, not hand `time` the string `a && b`.

So the split is outside everything: `dispatch_line` cuts the line into segments and hands each to
`dispatch`, which is the function every path in the shell already went through. **A segment is a
whole command line and nothing under it learned a new grammar.** It is also bash's binding, where a
connector joins pipelines and `time` applies to one pipeline.

```text
line      := segment (connector segment)*
connector := ';' | '&&' | '||'
segment   := <a whole command line: stages, operators, prefix words>
```

### A connector carries one bit and no capability

This is where a shell usually leaks. On Unix a `&&` chain runs inside one process holding one
ambient authority, so "what the second command may touch" is a question the connector never has to
answer. Here it does, and the answer is that **each segment is planned from scratch against what the
shell holds**, exactly as if it had been typed alone.

The concrete thing that could have gone wrong is the pipeline region. Each line splits a region off
the shell's budget, mints its endpoints in it, and `DESTROY`s it when the line is over, and that
destroy is what turns a stalled writer's next `SEND` into `abi::Error::Gone` (notes/pipes.md). A
chain that reused one region across its segments would keep every earlier segment's endpoints alive
for the whole chain, and a writer parked on the first would never be told.

It does not, and the reason is where the split is rather than anything anybody wrote: teardown
happens at the end of a **segment**, because `dispatch_line` sits above `pipeline` rather than
inside it.

### Two things that are deliberately not connectors

**A single `|` is the pipe.** Only the doubled form is a connector, and getting that wrong would
turn every pipeline in the system into two commands.

**A single `&` is an ordinary byte**, so `date &` runs `date` with a word `&` on the line. Job
control is milestone 48's, and this module reads only the doubled form so that milestone can give
`&` a meaning without one having been taken away first.

## Exit status: a refusal is not an error

This is the fork the milestone was raised to settle.

**Unix cannot draw the line.** `127` (no such command) and a program's own `exit(1)` are the same
kind of integer there, and `&&` cannot tell them apart because the shell has nothing better to say.
Here the two are genuinely different events and the shell knows which:

| `$?` | | |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | **Ran** | the line ran and the shell has nothing to report |
| `1` | **Failed** | something was attempted and did not work: the filesystem answered with an errno, init had no memory to spawn with, a job was interrupted or torn down |
| `2` | **Refused** | the shell declined, decided at the prompt from what it *holds* and what a manifest says, with **nothing spawned, nothing opened and no authority moved** |

Separating the last two is the answer, and it is worth a number because they answer different
questions. *"Did my command fail?"* and *"was I able to ask?"* are not the same question, and a shell
that refuses constantly and by design should be able to say which one happened. A refusal is also
reproducible in a way a failure is not: the same line refuses again.

```text
$ worker 3 && echo yes
  a process at EL0 computed 3*3 = 9
yes
$ worker || echo no
  worker: needs an integer argument
no
$ worker
  worker: needs an integer argument
$ echo $?
2
```

`&&` and `||` read **one bit** out of it, because they ask one question and both non-zero answers
are "no". A third connector that distinguished them would be inventing a control-flow word nobody
has asked for; the distinction stays where a person can see it, in `$?`.

### What the status is *not*, stated because the gap is real

**No program in this system reports an exit status**, and `$?` does not pretend one did. A spawned
program answers with a *value* (`worker 7` answers 49), with bytes, or through a job frame, and none
of those is a status. So `$?` is the **shell's own reading of what happened to the line**, which
today is all there is.

Inventing a per-program status would mean a `spawnproto` bit, a delegation position, and an edit to
every program, which is a milestone and not a field. Saying so beats a number nobody produced.

### And what it cannot carry

One small integer, which designates nothing: no capability, no name, no handle. A `&&` chain hands
the next segment a **bit**. That is the whole of what passes between two commands here, and it is
the difference between this and a shell where the second command inherits the first's world.

### `$?` is a word the expander knows, not a variable

There is no variable mechanism in this shell at all, so `$?` is one word `echo` recognises, in the
same category as a pattern. It is spelled `$?` because that is the spelling every shell user already
arrives with, and this project does not respell a name a reader already knows.

It is expressible at all only because the status has three values: `Status::digits` returns a
`&'static [u8]`, and a `'static` slice unifies with the line's lifetime. A status with an unbounded
range would need a buffer, and in a shell with no allocator there is nowhere to put one. That is the
same constraint quoting met, met again from the other side.

### `$?` is the previous *command*, not the previous line

The first draft of the boot gate put `echo $?` straight after `worker || echo no` and got `0`. That
was the shell being right: the last thing that ran was the `echo`. A skipped segment leaves `$?`
alone, because nothing happened, which is bash's rule and now this shell's.

The mechanism is two cells rather than one (`CURRENT` and `LAST` in `components/src/swish.rs`), because a
segment has to read the previous segment's answer *while* accumulating its own: `worker || echo $?`
is exactly the case one cell could not serve.

`CURRENT` was an `AtomicBool` called `TROUBLE` until this milestone, set by whichever printer had bad
news and read by `xargs` to stop a sweep. **Widening it from a bit to a status is the whole of what
`$?` needed**: the shell already knew that something had gone wrong, and what it did not record was
which kind. `xargs` now reads it the same way `&&` does.

## EXAMPLES

At a real prompt on the RedoxFS fixture. The transcript below is `NIFE_SHOW_TRANSCRIPT=1
script/shell-check --arch aarch64`, which boots `--features shell` and types at the prompt through
the real `components/src/progenitor.rs`.

```text
$ echo hello world > "my notes.txt"
$ wc < "my notes.txt"
  1 2 12
$ wc "my notes.txt"
  1 2 12
$ echo "*.txt"
*.txt
$ caps wc "my notes.txt"
  wc would grant the new process, and nothing else:
    cap 0  endpoint  result   report its answer back
    output   this shell's result endpoint (it reads the bytes and prints them)
    input    my notes.txt  (this shell reads it and streams it in; the program
             holds an endpoint, not a file)
    arg    (none)
  reading the command is reading its whole authority.
$ worker 3 && echo yes
  a process at EL0 computed 3*3 = 9
yes
$ worker || echo no
  worker: needs an integer argument
no
$ worker
  worker: needs an integer argument
$ echo $?
2
```

Read `caps wc "my notes.txt"` rather than the counts. The `input` row names a file whose name has a
space in it, which is a sentence the preview could not have been about before this milestone, and
the parenthesis after it is unchanged: what the child holds is still an endpoint and not a
capability naming the disk.

The riscv64 leg is the same session with the same answers, which is the parity gate met by running
the same script rather than by a second implementation.

## What the guest test proves, on both ISAs

`kernel::user::language_tests` reads the tail of the **same run of the same script**
`redirection_tests` reads: the real shell binary with a terminal, a spawn channel, a result channel,
a budget, and a directory narrowed by an `fs_subtree_caretaker` to one subtree of the real RedoxFS
image. Both halves of the milestone need that wiring: a quoted name is only worth something if it
reaches a filesystem, and a `&&` needs a command that can succeed.

**It shares the witness rather than wiring its own, and that is a memory finding worth keeping.**
The first version had a seventh role, `ROLE_LANGUAGE`, with the identical endowment. Every scripted
shell in this suite is a live process whose frames nothing reclaims, and the seventh one put
`time_tests` over the frame pool *intermittently*: two consecutive runs of unchanged code, one green
and one dying with `refused to load a user program: Unmappable(OutOfFrames)` and then a lost-wakeup
watchdog sixty seconds later. The wiring the new lines needed was already there, so the second copy
of it bought nothing but the flake. The transcript buffer grew from 4 KiB to 8 KiB to hold the longer
script, which is kernel `.bss` and costs no frames at all.

The lesson generalises past this milestone: **a scripted-shell witness is not free, and the price is
paid by whatever test runs last.** A new claim about the shell should look for a witness whose
endowment already matches before it asks for a role of its own.

The assertions are **pairs**, which is `redirection_tests`'s shape and for the same reason. A single
line proving "it printed something" would pass on a shell that ignored quoting entirely.

- `echo "*.txt"` against `echo *.txt`: the same four characters, quoted and not. The quoted one must
  print itself and the bare one must not, so a shell where quoting did nothing fails both halves.
- `worker 3 && echo yes` against `worker && echo yes`: one connector against a left-hand side that
  was refused. `worker 3` runs and `worker` alone is refused for the integer its manifest requires,
  so the condition table is covered by two real commands rather than by a branch written for a test.
- `wc "my notes.txt"` against `wc < "my notes.txt"`: the same designation said two ways, whose byte
  counts are derived from the `echo` that wrote the file rather than written down.
- `echo $?` after a command that ran and after one that was refused: `0` and `2`.

## BUGS, named where the reader meets them

- **No backslash escape, and none is planned while tokens are slices.** `my\ notes.txt` is a file
  whose name contains a backslash, and `nav::component_fits` refuses that byte, so the line is
  refused rather than misread. The quoted spelling is the one that works.
- **Adjacent pieces are not joined.** `a"b"` is `Refusal::PartlyQuoted` where POSIX reads `ab`, and
  `'it''s'` is the same where POSIX joins three pieces. Both are refused by name rather than
  silently misread, and `"it's"` is the spelling that works.
- **`"$?"` prints `$?`**, because both quote forms are literal today. When variables arrive the two
  forms have to stop being the same thing, and that decision belongs with them.
- **`$?` is readable only in `echo`.** `worker $?` treats the two characters as an argument and is
  refused for not being an integer. Substituting a word anywhere else needs the machinery milestone
  47's variables need anyway, and building half of it here would be building it twice.
- **There is no grouping.** `a && b || c` is left to right with no precedence between `&&` and `||`,
  which is bash's rule, and there is no `{ }` or `( )` to override it. Subshells are milestone 52's
  and grouping should arrive with them.
- **`time a && b` times only `a`.** That is the outermost-split binding and it matches bash, but a
  person who wanted the chain timed has no spelling for it until grouping exists.
- **A single `&` runs nothing in the background.** It is an ordinary byte on the line. Job control is
  milestone 48's.
- **A sequence is at most eight commands and a pipeline at most four stages.** Past either the line
  is refused rather than truncated, which is the same posture `line::MAX_STAGES` already took.
- **`xargs <program>` still stops after planning batch one**, unchanged by this milestone: the shell
  cannot yet ask init to mint a per-batch caretaker, which is milestone 47's delegation chain. A
  sweep that stops is a segment that did not succeed, so `xargs rm *.txt && echo done` will not print
  `done`, which is the right answer for the wrong reason.
- **A `Failed` and a `Refused` are indistinguishable to `&&`.** That is deliberate (one question, one
  bit) but it means a chain cannot branch on *why* it stopped without reading `$?`, and reading `$?`
  needs `echo`, which cannot condition anything. Until there is a conditional, the distinction is for
  a person and not for a script.
- **A pipeline's status is the first thing that went wrong, not the last stage's.** bash reports the
  last stage by default; here the first non-`Ran` wins, because the first thing that went wrong is
  what stopped the line and a later printer describing a consequence should not overwrite the cause.
  Nothing in this system reports a per-stage status anyway, so the two rules cannot yet disagree
  about anything a person could observe.
- **Scripting is still nowhere.** `if`, `while`, `for`, functions, and reading a script file are not
  here and were never in scope: this project has no story yet for what a script *is* when a program
  namespace is an endowment. Doing quoting and sequencing first is what makes that question
  answerable rather than theoretical.
