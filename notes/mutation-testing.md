# Mutation testing: the baseline and the triage rule

Milestone 85 (mutation testing over the host crates). `script/mutation` runs
[cargo-mutants](https://mutants.rs/) over the host crates. It rewrites one function at a time
(replace a return value, delete a match arm, flip an operator), reruns the mutated package's tests,
and records whether anything noticed. Coverage asks whether a line ran under a test. A mutation run
asks whether any test would notice if the line were wrong, which is the property a test suite exists
for.

It is a report, not a gate. A new survivor fails nothing until the weekly numbers are stable enough
to deserve it.

This page is enough to run the tool, read its numbers and triage a survivor. The per-crate history,
and how each number got to where it is, lives in the [appendices](#appendices).

## Running it

```console
$ script/mutation -p calendar             # one package; minutes
$ script/mutation --list                  # enumerate mutants, run nothing
$ script/mutation --report [DIR...]       # per-crate table from finished run output
$ script/mutation-census --add-run <id>   # record a green weekly run in the tree
$ script/mutation-census --compare 2026-09-19 2026-09-21
```

A full local run takes hours. The weekly `mutation testing` workflow (`.github/workflows/mutation.yml`)
runs the same command eight-way sharded with `--sharding round-robin`, so each shard is a uniform
sample of every crate.

The tool version is pinned in `.cargo-mutants-version`, today 27.1.0. The pin matters more here than
for most tools: cargo-mutants changes which mutants it generates between versions, so an unpinned
tool moves the numbers with nothing in the tree changed. Exclusions live in `.cargo/mutants.toml`,
each with its reason. That file is config, not a code dependency, per §46 (thin primitives or whole
subsystems).

To ask where a crate's mutants sit before restructuring it for testability, run
`cargo mutants --list -p <crate>`. It attributes every mutant to its enclosing function.

## The triage rule

Every survivor becomes exactly one of three things, and nothing stays untriaged:

1. **A test worth writing.** The mutant found a property no test asserts; assert it.
2. **A recorded exclusion.** The function cannot be tested on the host, or the mutant is
   semantically equivalent to the original. It goes in `.cargo/mutants.toml` with the reason next
   to it. An exclusion without a reason is a hole, not a decision.
3. **An honest deferral, recorded here.** A real gap whose test is not worth its cost yet. It is
   named in this note, so the weekly number has a ledger behind it.

A kill counts only when the named test was seen to fail under the mutation. An equivalence claim
counts only when a second run still reports the mutant, or when it is an algebraic identity.
The baseline triage learned why: a verdict reached by reading is wrong about ten percent of the
time; a verdict reached by running is not ([baseline-ledger](mutation-testing/baseline-ledger.md)).

## How to read the numbers

`killed%` is caught plus timeouts over viable mutants.

**`killed%` counts a timeout as a kill**, because every one of the 96 was checked by hand and every
one is a detected hang. That check was made on the 2026-08-03 baseline. A timeout is almost always
a loop that never ends, such as `+=` becoming `-=` on a walker's cursor.

It is over viable mutants, so `unviable` is excluded from the denominator: an unviable mutant does
not compile, which says nothing about the tests. It is still a hole in the measurement. A function
whose only mutant is unviable was never tested at all, and scores as though it passed
([measured-boot](mutation-testing/measured-boot.md)).

"Survivors" means missed plus timeouts. That is what `script/mutation --report` lists as "the
survivors themselves".

A census is a whole-corpus run. The weekly run's eight shards together make one; a single shard is
a sample. A sample cannot tell an absent mutant from a killed one, so a per-crate rate from one
reads as a crate that got worse. A whole run is different: it is a census rather than a sample.

## The current numbers

The latest census is the scheduled run of 2026-09-21,
[35589550926](https://github.com/crickertech/nife/actions/runs/35589550926), recorded in the tree
on 2026-09-24:

| census | crates | mutants | viable | survivors | killed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-03, the baseline | 38 | 5,551 | 5,141 | 391 | 92.4% |
| 2026-09-14 | 64 | 10,012 | 9,277 | 771 | 91.7% |
| 2026-09-16 | 62 | 9,626 | 8,903 | 687 | 92.3% |
| 2026-09-19 | 62 | 9,656 | 8,925 | 563 | 93.7% |
| **2026-09-21** | **66** | **10,988** | **10,178** | **771** | **92.4%** |

Here "survivors" is the missed count; 2026-09-21 also has 206 timeouts. The per-crate rows are in
`notes/project-metrics/mutation-census.csv`, and [`notes/mutation-census.md`](mutation-census.md)
explains them.

Like-for-like, the score has risen since the baseline. Read consistently, the 38 baseline crates
were 94.7% on 2026-09-19 against 92.4% in August. Over the 62 crates shared with 2026-09-19, the
2026-09-21 rate rose again, 93.7% to 93.8%.

The corpus number fell on 2026-09-21 because of what arrived, not what decayed. Four crates were
measured for the first time and one grew eightfold:

| crate | viable | killed | missed | since 2026-09-19 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `uefi_loader` | 356 | 48.9% | 182 | 34 viable at 100%; 132 missed were unbuilt files |
| `stick_maker` | 288 | 64.9% | 101 | new |
| `portable_executable` | 277 | 72.6% | 76 | new |
| `firmware_configuration` | 32 | 84.4% | 5 | new |
| `sealed_pair` | 63 | 95.2% | 3 | new |

So the worklist is short and named: `stick_maker` and `portable_executable`, then `paging` at 89.5%
with 57 missed, then `uefi_loader`'s 50 real survivors (below).

Read `uefi_loader`'s row with care: most of its drop was the
[2026-09-04 trap](mutation-testing/uefi-loader.md) again, confirmed on 2026-09-24. The exclusion
covered `uefi_loader/src/main.rs` but not the modules it declares, `src/arch/` and `src/chooser.rs`,
which no host build compiles either. The census artifacts put 132 of the crate's 182 missed in
`src/arch/`. Without them the crate reads 77.7% (174 of 224 viable), with 50 real survivors in
`device_tree_patch.rs`, `handoff.rs` and `image.rs`, and the corpus reads 93.6%. Both files are now
excluded, and `script/lint` walks a gated target's whole module tree, so the next one fails the gate.

## How it got here

The baseline was one local run on 2026-08-03, and it is the fixed point
`.cargo/mutants-baseline.txt` records ([baseline-2026-08-03](mutation-testing/baseline-2026-08-03.md)).
Every one of its 391 missed and 96 timeouts was triaged, crate by crate, and none was deferred
([abi to ipc](mutation-testing/baseline-survivors-abi-to-ipc.md),
[grant_plan to swish](mutation-testing/baseline-survivors-grant-plan-to-swish.md),
[the ledger](mutation-testing/baseline-ledger.md)).

The weekly workflow then failed every scheduled run until 2026-09-14, and nobody noticed until
milestone 238 (two scheduled checks have never once succeeded) looked. One shard of eight finished
on 2026-09-03 and read as a fall from 92.4% to 85.3%. The first full census, on 2026-09-14, showed
the fall was an artifact ([the-first-weekly-censuses](mutation-testing/the-first-weekly-censuses.md)).
Three crates had been scored against suites that could not reach them, and a single mutant could
exhaust a runner's memory:

- `system_initializer` could not compile on the host at all; milestone 244 (the largest crate in
  the tree is proved by nothing a mutation can reach) excluded it.
- `uefi_loader`'s binary half is a file no host build compiles
  ([uefi-loader](mutation-testing/uefi-loader.md)).
- `documentation` had a third of its tests behind a default-off feature
  ([documentation](mutation-testing/documentation.md)).
- Milestone 277 (bound what one mutant may allocate) gave each mutant a memory limit, which is what
  let a whole run finish ([a-memory-bound-per-mutant](mutation-testing/a-memory-bound-per-mutant.md)).

Milestone 326 (turn a mutation score upward) then triaged the 2026-09-14 census. Parts 1 and 2 took
the crates that regressed from the baseline
([capability to dtb](mutation-testing/regressions-capability-to-dtb.md),
[clock_protocol, swish, filesystem_protocol](mutation-testing/regressions-clock-protocol-swish-filesystem-protocol.md),
[machine_discovery](mutation-testing/machine-discovery.md)). Part 3 took the worst of the crates
new since the baseline ([new-crate-backlog](mutation-testing/new-crate-backlog.md) and the four
appendices after it). Most survivors were missing tests, not bugs. The exceptions are real
wrong-accepts, and `gpt`'s at the baseline is the one to read first: it accepted a table whose last
usable block sat inside the backup array.

## The ledger

Every triaged survivor lands in one column: killed (a named test fails under it), equivalent,
hang (a timeout confirmed to be a loop that never ends), excluded (with its reason in
`.cargo/mutants.toml`), or recorded gap. The baseline's 487 survivors split 225 killed, 170
equivalent, 95 hangs, and none deferred ([baseline-ledger](mutation-testing/baseline-ledger.md)).
Milestone 326's crates each carry the same split at the head of their own section, in the
appendices from 2026-09-19 on. A recorded gap is written beside the crate's accounting, with what
would close it.

The ledger has no column for unviable mutants, and it should. Milestone 250 (an unviable mutant is
a hole in the measurement that reads as a pass) is that work, not started.

## What the tool has taught

These recur across the appendices, so each is stated once here.

- An exhaustive sweep proves *rejection*, not *rejection for the right reason*. A mutant that
  weakens check B survives any input that also trips check A. `gpt`'s real bug hid this way
  ([baseline-2026-08-03](mutation-testing/baseline-2026-08-03.md)).
- A fixture that never meets the boundary cannot tell `>` from `>=`. Test at the exact limit.
- A wire format written as shifted constants needs one test pinning the exact values.
  `1 << 0` becoming `1 >> 0` is the one equivalent case.
- A release-mode guard behind a `debug_assert!` of the same condition is unobservable under
  `cargo test`. Those mutants are recorded as equivalent under the harness, not excluded, so they
  stay visible.
- Memory-ordering mutants change nothing a single-threaded test can see. Concurrency claims are
  argued in comments or proved. Loom models are excluded from the count (`interleavings::` in
  `.cargo/mutants.toml`), because a mutant there tests the model, not the crate.
- A mutant that breaks a loop that waits produces a hang, not a wrong answer. Where the crate
  allows it, run the test body on a worker with a deadline, and the hang becomes a named assertion
  failure. Better still, delete the loop: a `for` over a slice has no increment to lose
  ([new-crate-backlog](mutation-testing/new-crate-backlog.md)).
- A score can measure code no test build compiles. A missed mutant in "0s build + 0s test" is a
  file nothing rebuilt, not a gap in the tests.

## Scope and honest caveats

This is the note's `BUGS` section.

- **Scope is the main workspace's host crates.** The exclusions and their reasons are in
  `.cargo/mutants.toml`. The bare-metal crates cannot compile for the host. `supervision_protocol`,
  `swap_protocol` and `virtio` compile but cannot run a line without a kernel. `xtask` is the build
  system, whose tests are the gates it runs.
- `redoxfs_server` and `tools/redoxfs_host` are not mutated. Each is its own workspace, kept apart
  so upstream RedoxFS never meets our clippy and fmt gates, and cargo-mutants works one workspace
  at a time. `redoxfs_server`'s pure logic is small and host-tested. The heavy half of its suite
  runs under QEMU (`script/test`'s redoxfs leg), so a host-only score would overstate the gap.
  Deferred, on the record.
- A survivor count is not a quality score across crates. Crates differ in how much of their surface
  a host test can assert. Compare a crate to its own last census, not to its neighbours.
- `script/mutation --report`'s `(baseline missed)` column is not "last week". It is
  `.cargo/mutants-baseline.txt`, one fixed run from 2026-08-03. Milestone 512 (the census blamed one
  pull request for 55 survivors it did not write) recorded this on 2026-09-23, and the trap is also
  named in `script/mutation` beside the column. Read as a recent delta, it turns six weeks of growth
  into whatever days sit between the reader and the crate's last change. That happened once.
  `design/fatal-risks.md`'s risk 3 blamed milestone 319 (the crate that parses firmware)'s pull
  request for `machine_discovery` going from 22 survivors to 77. Replaying `cargo mutants --in-diff`
  against that pull request found 4; the crate already carried 73 before it merged. Compare
  censuses with `script/mutation-census --compare` instead, which milestone 518 (a census that
  cannot be attributed) built for this.
- Timeouts are auto-derived by cargo-mutants from each package's own build and test time. A mutant
  that makes a loop spin forever is recorded as `timeout`. The baseline's timeouts were checked and
  are detected hangs, mostly cursor arithmetic in walkers. A timeout on a mutant that could not
  hang would be triaged as a survivor.
- A mutant that hangs is not a mutant that survived, and this instrument cannot say so. The only
  limits cargo-mutants 27.1.0 offers are clocks: `--timeout`, `--build-timeout`, their two
  multipliers and `--minimum-test-timeout`, as milestone 277 checked. So a deadlocked suite and a
  slow one produce the same `TIMEOUT` row, and `--report` lists both among the survivors. Nine
  survivors across milestone 326's two lanes were non-terminating rather than wrong, and each
  had to be argued in prose. What would close it is a rule in `--report` comparing a timeout with
  the package's baseline test time: orders of magnitude over is a deadlock, twice over is a slow
  test. Until then, read every `timeout` row as unclassified, and expect the triage to say which.
- A deadlock in one test hides an assertion failure in another. The classification is per run: if
  any test in the binary hangs, the mutant is a `TIMEOUT` however loudly the others failed.
  Milestone 326 met this twice. In `memory_corruption_canary_gate`, deleting `ArmGuard`'s `Drop`
  fails a named assertion and hangs a sibling test. In `jh7110_entropy`, `Pool`'s own doctest calls
  `take` directly, so no change to the test module can move the classification. Hand-applying the
  mutant left `cargo test --doc` at "has been running for over 60 seconds". Bounding one blocking
  call proves the property but does not move the number. Bounding all of them works only where no
  doctest blocks.
- Nothing gates capturing a census. The 2026-09-21 run went green and sat unrecorded for three days
  until this page needed its number. GitHub keeps the artifacts for 90 days.
- The 205 timeouts of 2026-09-19 and the 206 of 2026-09-21 have not been hand-checked the way the
  baseline's 96 were. `killed%` still counts them as kills, on that older evidence.

### Closed on 2026-09-24: the one survivor nobody had triaged

`compositor`'s `replace * with + in Rect::area` was the single genuine decay on a line nobody
edited. Milestone 517 (what fraction of survivor growth arrives on lines a pull request touched)
found it among 142 candidates; the other 141 were already survivors in August. That lane could not
hold this file, so the survivor was recorded here as pending. Every fixture rectangle was square,
and `2 * 2 == 2 + 2`. The test `area_multiplies_width_by_height` now uses a 3 by 5 rectangle, and
fails under the hand-applied mutant.
