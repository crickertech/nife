# The network stack as a confined component (milestone 30)

Milestone 30 is three pieces in order: multi-queue transport confinement, a userspace virtio-net
driver behind it, and a TCP/IP stack (smoltcp) in a net server speaking a capability-shaped socket
contract. This note records what is built, the prior art read before drawing the contract, the
contract proposal (a design fork left for calef), the smoltcp pin, and the remaining work.

## Piece 1: multi-queue confinement (built, both ISAs)

The disk uses one virtqueue; a NIC uses two (receive on queue 0, transmit on queue 1). The §18
transport seam and the shadow-ring validator were queue-0-only. Piece 1 grew them to N queues
(N = 2 today, fixed and asserted) under the same confinement discipline, so the driver work sits on
proved ground rather than a NIC forcing a retrofit.

The mechanics are in notes/dma.md ("Multiple queues, and the receive direction") and DECISIONS §23.
The short version:

- `setup_queue(id, num, queue)` and `notify(id, queue)` take a queue number; the `Virtio`
  capability's methods grew an argument rather than gaining new methods, so the surface stays narrow
  and the disk's ABI is byte-identical (it passes queue 0).
- Queue `q`'s rings live at `q * RING_BLOCK` (0x200) in both the driver's DMA region and one
  kernel-private shadow frame. Per-queue last-validated index; per-queue PCI doorbell.
- **The validator did not change.** It bounds descriptor addresses, not directions. Receive is the
  direction where the device *writes into* driver memory, and the same in-region check that stops a
  read descriptor aimed at the kernel stops a receive descriptor aimed there. This is the property
  milestone 32's block write already relied on, now proved for the device-as-writer direction.

Tests (both ISAs): `the_validator_refuses_an_rx_descriptor_that_escapes_the_region` and
`a_second_queue_validates_on_its_own_block`, beside the existing confinement suite.

## Piece 2: the virtio-net driver (built, both ISAs)

A NIC driven from EL0, behind Piece 1's confinement, the same shape as the disk driver. The kernel
enumerates the device (`find_net_device` beside `find_block_device`, on the mmio bus in
kernel/src/virtio.rs and the PCI bus in kernel/src/pci.rs; the enumeration structs were generalized
from block-specific to transport-neutral, since a register base and an interrupt are all the kernel
hands a driver either way), owns the registers and the two DMA-critical powers, and hands the driver
a confined `Virtio` capability, a DMA page, and an interrupt. On PCIe the NIC sits behind the IOMMU
(`iommu_platform=on`), the disk's pattern exactly, so it is confined in hardware too.

The driver is `crates/virtio`'s `run_net`, dispatched by both driver binaries (the aarch64 tests
run it as a role of `hello`, the riscv tests as a role of the dedicated `block_driver` binary; both include
the shared `virtio` module). It brings up **both** virtqueues (receive = 0, transmit = 1) through the
one capability, passing the queue number to `SETUP_QUEUE` and `NOTIFY`. The whole net-specific DMA
layout (two ring blocks at the kernel's 0x200 stride, a receive buffer, a transmit buffer) fits in
the single 4 KiB DMA page the spawn service already hands every driver.

**The proof is a DHCP round trip**, no TCP/IP stack in the loop: post a receive buffer, hand-build a
DHCP DISCOVER (Ethernet + IPv4 + UDP + BOOTP, broadcast flag set), transmit it, and receive the OFFER
that QEMU user-mode networking (slirp) sends back. The driver parses the OFFER and reports the offered
address (`yiaddr`), which the test asserts lands in slirp's 10.0.2.0/24. A valid OFFER for our
transaction id is the only path to that report, so a match proves the DISCOVER left (TX) and the OFFER
returned (RX), across both queues and both directions of the confinement. Tests (both ISAs, both
transports): `a_userspace_driver_completes_a_dhcp_round_trip_over_virtio_net` and its `_pci` twin.

The runners attach two NICs (mmio + PCI-behind-IOMMU) on slirp when `NIFE_NET` is set, which xtask
sets for both test legs. slirp needs no host file, so unlike the disk there is nothing for the runner
to fail loud on; the manufactured-fact hazard (a NIC asked for but not enumerated) is caught by the
test asserting the exchange rather than skipping.

## Prior art, read before the contract

The reuse call (smoltcp, not a hand-built TCP) is settled in the roadmap. What the prior art informs
is the *contract*: how a process asks a userspace stack to open a socket, and how bytes and events
cross the boundary.

**seL4 net_stack componentization** (and the CAmkES/lwIP and later Rust efforts). The stack is a
component; clients reach it over seL4 endpoints, and bulk data moves through **shared dataports**
(pre-shared memory regions), not through the IPC message. Control (open, connect, close, "data
ready") travels as small messages on the endpoint; payload lives in the shared region. This is the
cleanest match to what this kernel already has: an `Endpoint` for control and a delegated `Frame`
for the shared buffer. The lesson taken: keep the per-connection data plane in shared frames and the
control plane in three-word messages, exactly the split DECISIONS §10 already chose for IPC.

**Fuchsia Netstack3** (Rust, the closest cousin). Sockets are **handles** (Fuchsia's capabilities);
there is no ambient network, and a component reaches the stack only through a handle routed to it by
the component framework. Netstack3 is a state machine driven by events, which is also smoltcp's
shape. The lesson: a socket is a capability, the stack is named by a capability, and "no ambient
network" is enforced by the same mechanism as everything else (you hold a handle or you do not).
This is the model the roadmap already commits to; Netstack3 is the evidence it works in Rust at
scale.

**Plan 9 /net, the counter-design.** Everything is a file: a connection is a directory
(`/net/tcp/clone`, then `ctl`, `data`, `status`), you `write` "connect 1.2.3.4!80" into `ctl`, and
`read`/`write` the `data` file. It is elegant and it is the wrong fit here, twice over: it needs a
filesystem-shaped **namespace**, which milestone 32's FS server deliberately does not provide (a
client holds a directory capability, and open-by-path exists only inside the server), and "everything
a file"
means "everything reachable by path," which is the ambient authority this project inverts. Read as
the road not taken: the capability contract is what /net's `ctl` file would be if designation were
authorization instead of a path lookup.

Synthesis: seL4's endpoint-plus-dataport data plane, Fuchsia's socket-is-a-capability control plane.
Neither is novel here; both are what this kernel's primitives already point at.

### Prior art for the *inbound* half: who may claim a listening port

Read for milestone 107, after the contract above was already built. The outbound question ("how does
a process reach a stack") and the inbound one ("who decides this program may serve port 80") turn out
to have almost disjoint prior art, which is itself worth knowing.

**POSIX, Linux and the BSDs: ambient above 1024.** Any process binds any free port. Below 1024 needs
`CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` on Linux, or historically root, and that is a **privilege rather than a
designation**: it says "this process may bind low ports", never *which* ones. Linux later added
`net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start` to move the line, which is the same knob in a different place.
`SO_REUSEPORT` lets several sockets share one port, so even exclusivity is opt-out.

**systemd socket activation, and `inetd` before it: the closest mainstream precedent, and it does not
enforce.** The service manager binds the port and passes the listening descriptor to the service
(`LISTEN_FDS`); the service never calls `bind`. That is exactly this milestone's shape: whoever
spawns you decides what you may serve. **The difference is enforcement.** Nothing stops a systemd
service binding port 9999 itself afterwards, because the pre-bound descriptor is a convenience rather
than a boundary. Here `NO_LISTEN_GRANT` means the server *cannot*, because the grant is checked at
the only place a port can be claimed. Read as: the mainstream pattern with the hole closed.

**Capsicum (FreeBSD): the same instinct, taken further.** After `cap_enter()` a process cannot `bind`
at all and must receive pre-bound sockets. Capsicum's answer to "which ports may this program serve"
is "none, ever, only what it is handed". That is stricter than ours and it is the honest upper bound
on this design.

**seL4: silent, and the silence is the finding.** The kernel models no ports, no sockets and no TCP;
networking is a userspace component (CAmkES/lwIP, later Rust). Whatever a net server implements *is*
the policy. So there is no seL4 answer to diverge from here, and any claim that "seL4 does X" means
"some unverified seL4 component does X", since seL4's proofs cover the kernel and a port policy is
outside them. **The same is true of us**: nothing in `crates/socket_proto` is machine-checked, and
this grant is ordinary code.

**Plan 9: authority by namespace.** You write `announce 80` into `/net/tcp/clone`, and what
constrains you is whether `/net/tcp` is in your namespace at all. Restriction is by what you can
*see* rather than by an explicit grant, which is the counter-design already recorded above.

### Where this differs from seL4, and what it costs

The data plane here **is** seL4's, deliberately (see the synthesis above). The difference is one level
up, in how a component gets its authority:

**seL4 systems wire statically.** CAmkES describes the whole system at build time (components,
endpoints, dataports, connections) and generates the glue; seL4 Microkit does the same with protection
domains and channels in a system description. There is no "spawn a net server and hand it port 7778
because somebody just asked". The topology is fixed before the machine boots.

**This tree grants at spawn, at run time.** `wire_net_server(..., listen_grant(7778, 7778))` is a
decision taken while the system runs, by whoever holds the authority to take it.

**What that buys**: authority that moves during operation, which is the whole of milestone 47's
caretakers and the shell's grant model. A static system cannot express a user handing a program a
port range it was never declared with.

**What it costs, and this is the honest half.** A static topology is checkable *as a whole*: a CAmkES
spec can be read to see every channel that will ever exist. Our grant is a `u64` computed at a call
site, so "which components may serve inbound ports?" has no artifact anyone can read. That is a real
loss against seL4, not a tie, and it is the same weakness this tree keeps meeting in other forms: a
fact that exists only at a call site (compare §76's roadmap status, and `script/names`' reason for
existing).

### One correction to the claim below

The section on listeners says POSIX "conflates" a listener and a connection. That is imprecise and
the sharper version is worth having: POSIX's `accept()` already returns a **new** descriptor, so the
two are distinct objects there too. What POSIX does is make them the same *type*, with hidden state
deciding which calls are valid on which. The claim that survives is narrower and stronger: here they
are distinct **authorities**, because a listener carries no frame and therefore structurally cannot
move bytes, where a POSIX listening descriptor is a `read`/`write`-shaped thing that merely fails.

## The socket contract (resolved: DECISIONS §25)

The roadmap sketched "an endpoint plus shared frames per connection; no ambient network." The
socket-identity question below was a genuine design fork, raised rather than built through; the
architect resolved it (DECISIONS §25 on main): **a socket is a socket id carried on the one `Stack`
endpoint, and the per-connection shared frame is the real granted resource. Minted-endpoint-per-socket
is deliberately deferred**, with the recorded trigger being a socket that must be delegated to a third
process. The rest of the shape below stands as the contract Piece 3 implements. Recommendation first,
then the questions (question 1 now answered).

**Recorded-accepted by milestone 94's sweep** (2026-08-04): a deferral that already names what would
end it, which is the shape a limitation is supposed to have, so an audit may pass over it. The
trigger is the promotion rule §71 later wrote down, arrived at here first. See
notes/untracked-work-sweep.md.

**Recommended shape.** A process holds one capability to the stack: a `Stack` endpoint. Everything
is a `CALL` on it or on a per-connection reply channel, control in the three-word message, bytes in
a per-connection shared frame delegated at open time.

- `Stack::open(kind, ...)` where `kind` is TCP or UDP -> a **socket capability** (a fresh endpoint
  minted by the server, or a small integer socket id carried on the stack endpoint; see open
  question 1). At open, the client delegates (or the server delegates back) a shared `Frame` that
  becomes that connection's TX/RX ring, seL4-dataport style.
- `Socket::connect(ip, port)`, `Socket::bind(port)`, `Socket::listen`, `Socket::send(len)`,
  `Socket::recv() -> len`, `Socket::close`. `send`/`recv` carry only a length; the bytes are already
  in the shared frame. "Data ready" is a message on the socket endpoint, the same way an `Irq`
  capability delivers an interrupt (WAIT-shaped), so a blocking read is a blocked `RECV`.
- DHCP and the interface config live entirely inside the server; a client never sees "the network,"
  only its own sockets. The server runs smoltcp's DHCP socket at startup and does not expose it.

**Why this fits.** It is the disk driver's discipline one layer up: the kernel confines the NIC's
DMA (Piece 1), the net server owns the smoltcp state and the NIC driver capability, and a client
gets exactly the sockets it was granted and no interface handle at all. Bytes never cross the
syscall boundary in a message (DECISIONS §10); they cross in a shared frame the two parties both
map.

**The questions.**

1. **Socket identity: DECIDED 2026-07-28 (calef): a socket id on the stack endpoint for phase
   one; minted-endpoint-per-socket is the deliberate later step, tracked in DECISIONS §25.** The
   trade as it was put to him: a minted endpoint per socket is the purest capability shape (a
   socket IS an unforgeable object, delegatable on its own), but it spends a kernel object (a
   page) per connection and needs the server to retype untyped per socket. A socket id (small
   integer) on the one stack endpoint is cheap and matches what `std::net`'s PAL wants (a
   file-descriptor-like handle), but "which socket" then rides in a message word rather than
   being the capability itself, which is weaker designation. The shared frame stays the real
   per-connection resource either way, which is what makes the later migration cheap.

2. **How does the shared frame's producer/consumer protocol work without a syscall per byte?** A
   ring buffer in the shared frame with head/tail indices, the driver pattern, so `send(len)` just
   advances a tail and messages the server. Straightforward, but the exact layout (one frame split
   TX/RX, or two frames) is a contract detail to pin.

3. **Blocking vs. poll for the PAL.** `std::net` is blocking by default. A blocked `RECV` on the
   socket endpoint gives blocking cleanly. Non-blocking/`poll` is a later PAL concern; phase one can
   be blocking-only and still satisfy the roadmap's "no sockets-API mimicry beyond what the PAL
   needs."

The driver (Piece 2) did not depend on any of this: it needs only Piece 1's confinement, and it is
built.

## smoltcp: the pin, and a corrected assumption

**Pin: smoltcp 0.13.1** (current on crates.io at 2026-07-28), `default-features = false`. Features
to enable: `proto-ipv4`, `proto-dhcpv4`, `socket-tcp`, `socket-udp`, `medium-ethernet`. Divergence
policy is the vendored-engine discipline (DECISIONS §18 point 3, and the RedoxFS pin): pin the
version, carry any patch as a recorded diff, note the reason. No patch is known to be needed yet;
smoltcp is no_std-clean and used across embedded Rust.

**Corrected assumption.** smoltcp bills itself as "for bare-metal, real-time systems **without a
heap**." It can run with fixed socket buffers and a static `SocketSet`, so the net server does **not**
strictly need the untyped-backed `GlobalAlloc` that RedoxFS (milestone 32) and the `std` PAL
(milestone 27) require. In the build we shipped, net_stack does use `alloc` (over user_rt's `UntypedHeap`,
milestone 27) because it is available and makes the socket set and per-frame buffers simpler; the
`alloc` feature is a convenience, not a precondition, so a fixed-capacity server remains possible if
that heap were ever unavailable.

## Piece 3 phase A: smoltcp doing DHCP over the confined NIC (built, both ISAs)

The net server, `net_stack` (user/src/net_stack.rs), is the networking form of the userspace-reuse thesis: a
real, reused TCP/IP stack (smoltcp 0.13.1, not hand-built) running entirely at EL0 over a NIC the
kernel confines by DMA. The kernel knows nothing about DHCP.

- `user/src/net_transport.rs` presents smoltcp's `phy::Device` over the receive/transmit virtqueues: it brings
  the NIC up through the `Virtio` capability, posts receive buffers, copies received frames out (RX
  tokens own their bytes so they never borrow the device), and transmits via the DMA ring (TX tokens
  carry a raw pointer to the device, sound because net_stack is single-threaded and the device outlives
  any token within a poll).
- `net_stack` links `alloc` over user_rt's `UntypedHeap`, builds a smoltcp `Interface` and a DHCP socket,
  and runs the poll loop, blocking on the NIC interrupt between polls. It reports the acquired
  address, which the test asserts lands in slirp's 10.0.2.0/24 (`the_net_server_acquires_a_dhcp_lease_over_smoltcp`
  and its `_pci` twin, both ISAs). Only a real DHCP handshake driven by smoltcp over the confined NIC
  produces that.
- The spawn service (`virtio_service::start_net_server{,_pci}`) grants net_stack the confined transport,
  the interrupt, a DMA page, a report endpoint, and an **untyped budget** for the heap, plus extra
  stack pages for smoltcp's packet building.
- **Caveat (recorded):** the DMA region is one 4 KiB page, so the buffers are small and the MTU is
  small (`net_transport::MTU`, 576). DHCP, DNS, and small TCP segments fit; a full 1514-byte frame does not. A
  larger MTU needs a multi-page contiguous DMA region, which the spawn path does not build yet. This
  is a demonstrator limit, not a protocol one.

DHCP is itself UDP, so smoltcp's UDP path over our NIC is exercised end to end by this test. What is
not yet built is the client-facing socket contract that lets *other* processes use the stack.

## Piece 3 phase B: the client-facing socket contract (built, both ISAs)

The §25 contract, so a process other than net_stack can open sockets. net_stack, after DHCP, serves requests
on a `Stack` endpoint; a client holds `WRITE` on it plus its own untyped budget. Files:
`crates/socket_proto/src/lib.rs` (the wire format), the serve loop in `user/src/net_stack.rs`, and the client in
`user/src/socket_test_client.rs` (a module of the net_stack binary, dispatched by the entry role, see the archive
note below).

- **A socket is a socket id.** Open returns a small integer, carried in the request word of every
  later call; the per-connection **shared frame** is the real granted resource, delegated once at
  open via `SEND_CAP` and mapped by net_stack at a per-socket VA. No ambient network: the client acts only
  through the `Stack` capability it was granted, and bytes cross in the shared frame, never in a
  message.
- **Operations.** `ATTACH_FRAME` is a `SEND_CAP` (it carries the frame). The rest are `CALL`s (which
  mint the reply cap net_stack answers on), the socket id packed into the request word: `OPEN_UDP` /
  `OPEN_TCP`; `SENDTO(len)` and `RECV() -> len` for UDP (destination and payload in the shared
  frame); `CONNECT` / `SEND(len)` / `RECV()` for TCP; `CLOSE`. A blocking `RECV` is net_stack driving the
  smoltcp poll loop (WAIT on the NIC interrupt) until the socket has data, then replying, the disk
  driver's discipline one layer up.
- **Frame layout, pinned.** One data region reused per operation, NOT a split TX/RX ring: the
  phase-one contract is one *synchronous* exchange per `CALL` (the client blocks in the CALL while
  net_stack drives the network), so a request's payload and its reply never coexist. A split ring becomes
  necessary only with asynchronous or streaming sockets, deferred with the concurrency model.
- **Concurrency model, phase one:** single-threaded net_stack, one synchronous exchange per request. net_stack
  blocks on the `Stack` endpoint between requests and drives the network inside handling one. This
  suits the `std::net` PAL's blocking calls; concurrent connections and listening sockets want either
  userspace threads (milestone 19c TCBs) or a select-like wait, the phase-two extension.
- **One binary, one archive entry.** The client rides in the net_stack binary (a nonzero entry role runs
  it) rather than a separate binary, because the nifefs archive directory held at most 15 files at
  the time and the initrd was already near that ceiling. (The ceiling is `nifefs::MAX_FILES`, 76
  since 2026-08-01; see [nifefs.md](nifefs.md). The decision stands on its own merits, but the
  pressure behind it is gone.) A subtlety worth recording: net_stack reports its DHCP
  lease with a *blocking* `send`, so the spawn service drains that report before returning, or net_stack
  never reaches its serve loop and the client's first request hangs. That was the one real bug in
  bring-up, caught by a watchdog hang.

### What the gate proves, and what it does not

Both tests are deterministic and zero-host-setup, run over both the mmio and the PCI-behind-IOMMU
transports, on aarch64 and riscv64:

- **UDP, `a_client_resolves_dns_through_the_socket_contract`.** A real DNS A-query for `example.com`
  to slirp's built-in resolver (10.0.2.3:53); the client verifies the reply is a response (QR bit) to
  its own transaction id. Proves UDP send and receive through the whole path (client, net_stack, smoltcp,
  confined NIC). It relies on the test host being able to resolve DNS, which slirp forwards; a host
  with no resolver would make this time out.
- **TCP, `a_client_echoes_over_tcp_through_the_socket_contract`.** A full round trip against a slirp
  `guestfwd` echo peer: the runners add `guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.9:7777-cmd:/bin/cat` to each NIC's
  `-netdev user`, so a guest connection to 10.0.2.9:7777 is piped to a fresh `/bin/cat`. The client
  does OPEN_TCP, CONNECT (the three-way handshake completes against a real peer), SEND a payload,
  RECV the echo and check it byte for byte, then CLOSE (the FIN). No host port is bound and nothing
  outlives QEMU, so the whole round trip, handshake through bidirectional data to teardown, is in the
  committed gate with zero host setup. Verified against QEMU 11.0.2.

**Not proven by the gate, when this was written:** inbound connections. A `LISTEN`/`accept` verb
plus a QEMU `hostfwd` (host port -> guest) is the way to test the guest accepting a connection, and
that is future work; the contract has no listen verb yet. The concurrency model above is the other
limit: one synchronous exchange at a time, no overlapping connections.

**Milestone 107 built exactly that**, and the paragraph above is kept as the record of the gap
rather than edited away. See "The inbound half" below for the verbs, the two design questions they
raised, and what the gate proves now. The concurrency sentence still stands, with one qualification
the accept work earned: a single listener now serves connections one after another without dropping
the next, which is not the same as serving two at once.

This binds milestone 27's `std::net` PAL, replacing its `Unsupported`. Scope discipline held: TCP,
UDP, DHCP, no sockets-API mimicry beyond what the PAL needs.

### Ephemeral ports must be independent of the socket id (a fix the PAL found)

The first version of net_stack derived a socket's local port from its socket id (`LOCAL_PORT_BASE + sid`).
That is wrong, and the `std::net` PAL flushed it out: a program that opens a TCP socket, closes it,
and opens another reuses the same socket id, so it reused the exact local port. Reconnecting to the
same peer on an identical 4-tuple whose slirp flow had not yet cleared makes the SYN go unanswered,
and net_stack stalled in its bounded connect poll forever. Bisection confirmed it: a fresh id connects, a
reused id hangs.

The fix is what any real stack does: net_stack allocates ephemeral local ports from a private range with a
**rotating allocator** independent of the socket id (`user/src/net_stack.rs`, `PortAllocator`). Each open
advances the cursor, so a just-closed connection's port is not handed out again until the whole range
has cycled, and a port a live socket still holds is skipped outright. Socket-id reuse is then safe:
the reopened socket gets a new local port, a new 4-tuple, and a new slirp flow.

The regression is `a_reopened_socket_id_connects_again_over_tcp` (both ISAs): open a TCP socket,
connect to the guestfwd echo peer, close, reopen the *same* id, and connect again; the client reports
OK only if both connects complete. Before the fix the second connect hangs the way the PAL saw.

### The RX poll must honor smoltcp's timers, not just the interrupt (a riscv-SMP lost-wakeup)

`std_net` hung on riscv under the 4-hart boot, watchdog-killed with every core idle and every thread
blocked, while the same test passed on aarch64 and the lighter DHCP and TCP-echo tests passed on
riscv in the same run. The shape said lost wakeup; the cause was subtler than a dropped interrupt.

The old server loop blocked on the NIC interrupt between polls: `poll; if done break; WAIT; ack`. That
is fine until an exchange depends on one of smoltcp's *own* timers. smoltcp drives TCP retransmits,
delayed ACKs, and DNS timeouts from its clock, which only advances when we call `poll`. If a segment's
ACK is dropped, the peer goes quiet waiting for our retransmit, and our retransmit is a timer event
that only fires on the next `poll`, which we are not doing because we are blocked on an interrupt the
peer will never send. net_stack waits for the peer, the peer waits for net_stack, both idle. Instrumenting the
PLIC at the hang showed the truth: **no source pending, the net source still enabled**. Not a masked
line, not a lost IRQ; the device was simply idle, because both ends were waiting on the same stalled
timer. aarch64 happened never to drop a segment (different servicing latency), so it never armed the
retransmit path; the riscv SMP scatter, which moves the driver and its wakes across harts, was slow
enough to drop one and expose the hole. It was not the IRQ affinity: forcing every source back to the
boot hart's PLIC context still hung, which ruled the PLIC out.

The fix (`wait_for_nic`, `user/src/net_stack.rs`) asks smoltcp when it next needs to run. With **no** timer
pending (`poll_delay` is `None`), it blocks on the interrupt, the common case, 0% CPU until a frame
arrives, and correct because with nothing of our own outstanding we are purely waiting on the peer,
whose retransmit will wake us. With a timer **pending**, it does not block: it yields and lets the
loop re-`poll`, so the timer fires and the retransmit goes out. The busy interval is confined to the
short retransmit window rather than the whole exchange. Both the DHCP bring-up loop and the
service loop use it. `std_net` then completes on both ISAs at the 4-hart/4-core boot.

The honest caveat: yielding across a retransmit window spins a hart until the timer is due (bounded by
the exchange, and by a 15 s per-call backstop well under the 60 s watchdog). The clean version is a
*timed* wait, a `WAIT` that returns on either the interrupt or a deadline, so the server sleeps
through the backoff instead of spinning. That is a small kernel-surface addition (an `Irq::WAIT`
timeout, or a timer notification) and is left as the follow-up; the yield-poll is correct and needs no
new syscall.

### The UDP gate must not depend on the host's resolver (a testing-hygiene defect, fixed)

The UDP socket-contract test queried `10.0.2.3:53` and called it "slirp's built-in resolver". That
description was wrong, and the error was not cosmetic: **10.0.2.3 is not a resolver.** libslirp
implements no DNS server. It NATs anything sent to its guest-visible nameserver address to the
*host's* configured nameserver, which it looks up with `get_dns_addr_libresolv`. So every run of that
"zero host setup" gate sent a real query out of the machine to whatever resolver the developer's
laptop happened to be using, and passed only if that resolver answered in time.

It was measured, not argued. A temporary instrument in the client sent the same `example.com` query
40 times in one boot and reported what came back:

- **1 of 40 queries got no answer** (2.5%), with a 15 s wait per query, so it is loss and not slowness.
- The answer's `ANCOUNT` was 2 and its first A record was `0x6814179a` = `104.20.23.154`, byte for
  byte what `dig @192.168.8.1 example.com` returned on the host at that moment. libslirp carries no
  zone data for `example.com` and cannot invent Cloudflare's rotating addresses, so this is direct
  proof that the host's resolver answered the guest's query.
- The same host resolver, probed directly with `dig +tries=1 +time=2`, dropped 1 of 30.

Two DNS queries ran per suite (mmio and PCIe), so a suite failed a few percent of the time from
nothing but a dropped packet on somebody's LAN, which matches the roughly one-in-three seen across a
handful of runs once network conditions were worse. UDP has no retransmit of its own and the client
sent exactly once, so a single lost datagram was a failed gate.

**The fix keeps the coverage and removes the dependency.** The gating UDP test now talks to slirp's
**own TFTP server** (`tftp=` on the netdev, at the gateway `10.0.2.2:69`), which libslirp answers
itself. The client sends a read request for a fixture the runners plant and asserts the reply is
`DATA`, block 1, with the fixture's exact bytes. This is the UDP twin of the guestfwd `/bin/cat` echo
peer the TCP gate already used: QEMU provides the service, nothing leaves the emulator, and no packet
can be dropped by a third party.

What the gate proves now: a client holding only a `Stack` endpoint and a shared frame can open a UDP
socket by id, send a datagram to an address of its choosing, and read the reply back through the same
frame, over both the mmio and PCIe transports, on both ISAs. That is the whole client-to-net_stack-to-
smoltcp-to-confined-NIC path, which is what the test was ever really for.

What it no longer proves, deliberately: that DNS resolution works, or that the guest can reach
anything outside the emulator. That case did not get deleted; it became **non-gating**. The client
still sends a real query (now with three attempts, which is ordinary resolver behaviour rather than a
widened timeout) and reports a distinct `NO_ANSWER` when the host never replies, which the kernel test
prints and skips. A reply that arrives but is *not* a valid answer to our transaction still fails the
suite, because that would be our defect rather than the network's. So a broken host resolver, or an
offline laptop, now skips a check instead of failing a build, and a broken socket contract still fails
loudly.

The PCIe DNS variant is gone, not lost: UDP over the PCIe transport is now covered by the TFTP gate's
PCIe twin, deterministically.

## The inbound half: the guest can be connected to (milestone 107)

Everything above is the guest as a client. The TCP gate connects out to a slirp `guestfwd` peer, the
UDP gate sends a request, DHCP is a client protocol. nife could reach the network and could not
be reached, and the contract had no listen verb to fix that with.

Milestone 107 adds `LISTEN` and `ACCEPT` (`crates/socket_proto`, opcodes 9 and 10, **names
provisional**), the smoltcp side in `user/src/net_stack.rs`, and a gate in which a **host process
connects into the guest** and gets an answer the guest composed. Two design questions came with the
verbs, and neither was copied from POSIX.

### A listener is not a connection, because they are not the same authority

(Prior art and one correction to the wording below: see "Prior art for the *inbound* half" above.)

POSIX makes a listening socket and an accepted one both file descriptors; the only difference is
which calls happen to work on each. That conflation is why "give this program port 80" and "give this
program this connection" are the same kind of grant there, and it is not a shape this tree should
inherit.

Here they are two objects:

- A **listener** names a port. It is exclusive (two programs cannot both hold 80) and it carries **no
  shared frame at all**, because no bytes ever cross on it.
- A **connection** names a peer. It is the object `CONNECT` already produced, reached from the other
  direction, and the shared frame is its real granted resource exactly as §25 says.

The frame is what makes this more than a naming preference. §25 already decided that the per-socket
shared frame is the granted thing and the socket id is bookkeeping; a listener has no frame, so under
that decision it has nothing to grant, and the split falls out rather than being imposed. This is the
tree's existing habit of splitting authority by what a holder can *do* rather than by what it names,
which is `Frame` versus `DeviceFrame` and `WRITE` versus `GRANT` on one object.

So `ACCEPT` carries the socket id to install the connection at (`CALL(req(OP_ACCEPT, lsid),
target_sid)`), the client must have attached a frame there first, and **`target_sid == lsid` is
refused**: the contract will not let a listener become a connection in place. The listener keeps its
id, its port, and its authority.

The client-side proof costs nothing and is worth having: `TEST_TCP_LISTEN_GRANT` in
`user/src/socket_test_client.rs` attaches no frame anywhere and still listens, binds and collides.

### Who binds the port: the spawn service grants a range, the client does not ask

Outbound needs no permission beyond the `Stack` capability, and that is not laxity: an ephemeral
local port is allocated by `net_stack`'s own rotating allocator and contended by nobody, so there is
nothing to arbitrate. **Inbound is different in kind.** A listening port is a claim on an exclusive
name in a shared namespace, which is the same property that makes a directory a capability here
rather than a path (milestone 32's FS server) and the same reason `bind` (§50) is a grant.

So the port is not the client's to pick. `wire_net_server` spawns `net_stack` with a **listen
grant**, an inclusive range packed by `socket_proto::listen_grant` and carried in the spawn's `arg2`;
`LISTEN` outside it replies `LISTEN_DENIED`. Every outbound test passes `NO_LISTEN_GRANT`, which is
also the default, so **a net server that was never told which ports it may serve refuses all of
them**: inbound authority is granted, never assumed. `LISTEN_DENIED` is deliberately a different
reply from `LISTEN_IN_USE`, because "you were not granted this" and "somebody else has it" call for
opposite responses from a client.

**The honest limit, and it is the interesting one.** The grant's granularity is the `Stack` endpoint,
not the client, because an endpoint carries no sender identity: `net_stack` cannot tell two callers
apart, so two clients sharing an endpoint share its grant. In this tree each stack endpoint has
exactly one client today, so nothing is wrong yet, but a real multi-client net server needs a
**minted endpoint per client** and the grant then rides on that. That is the same deferred step §25
already recorded for socket identity, arriving from a second direction, which is itself the finding:
the thing that would make a socket an unforgeable object is the same thing that would make a port
grant per-client. If that step is ever taken, it should be taken once, for both.

### The concurrency model, and what "accept" had to mean to be worth shipping

The roadmap block warned that adding `LISTEN` to a stack handling one exchange at a time produces a
server that accepts a connection and then cannot accept the next one. smoltcp has no accept queue: a
`tcp::Socket` in `Listen` state *becomes* the established connection, and there is no separate
listener object to accept from again.

The answer is that `ACCEPT` **re-arms**. It hands the established socket to the target id and
immediately creates a fresh `tcp::Socket` parked in `Listen` on the same port under the listener's
id, before returning. Two smoltcp sockets then share a local port, one established and one listening,
which is safe because smoltcp's dispatch refuses to hand an ACK-bearing segment to a `Listen`-state
socket and refuses a segment from the wrong peer to an established one.

What that buys, honestly stated:

- A listener serves connections **one after another**, indefinitely, and does not go deaf after one.
- A handshake that arrives while the client is busy on an earlier connection **completes underneath
  it**, because `net_stack` drives the poll loop inside every blocking operation, and is waiting when
  the client next calls `ACCEPT`.
- The backlog is **one connection deep**. A second peer arriving in the window between a handshake
  completing and `ACCEPT` re-arming gets a RST rather than a wait.
- Two connections cannot be served *simultaneously*, because the client blocks in one `CALL` at a
  time. That is the phase-one limit recorded above, unchanged.

For milestone 54's file service that is the difference between usable and not: a Mac mounting a share
opens connections in sequence. For milestone 55's SMB3, which uses several at once, the remaining
step is real concurrency (userspace threads, or a select-shaped wait), not another verb.

### EXAMPLES: serving a port, end to end

**Spawn side.** Whoever wires the pair decides the inbound authority, and the client never asks for
it. `socket_proto::listen_grant(lo, hi)` packs an inclusive range into the one word `arg2` carries:

```rust
// A stack whose client may listen on 7778 and nothing else.
let report = virtio_service::start_net_stack(
    image,
    NET_TEST_TCP_ACCEPT,                                    // which exchange the client drives
    false,                                                  // mmio, not PCIe
    socket_proto::listen_grant(NET_LISTEN_PORT, NET_LISTEN_PORT),
)?;

// A stack that serves nobody inbound, which is every other net test in the tree.
let report = virtio_service::start_net_stack(image, NET_TEST_TCP_ECHO, false,
                                             socket_proto::NO_LISTEN_GRANT)?;
```

**Client side.** Bind the port, then accept into a *different* socket id that already has a frame.
The listener never gets a frame, and `ACCEPT` refuses to install a connection at the listener's own
id:

```rust
// 1. Bind. No frame is attached anywhere yet, because a listener carries no bytes.
match call(STACK, req(OP_LISTEN, LISTEN_SID), 7778).0 {
    LISTEN_GRANTED => {}
    LISTEN_DENIED  => /* this stack was never granted 7778: ask the spawner, not again */,
    LISTEN_IN_USE  => /* somebody already holds it: pick another port */,
    _ => unreachable!(),
}

// 2. The connection id is what carries data, so it is what gets the frame.
attach_frame(CONN_SID);

// 3. Accept, use, close, repeat. The listener re-arms inside ACCEPT, so this loop keeps working.
loop {
    if call(STACK, req(OP_ACCEPT, LISTEN_SID), CONN_SID).0 != REP_OK { break; }
    let (len, _) = call(STACK, req(OP_RECV, CONN_SID), 0);
    // ... read the request out of the frame at FRAME_VA + OFF_PAYLOAD, write the answer back ...
    let _ = call(STACK, req(OP_SEND, CONN_SID), reply_len);
    let _ = call(STACK, req(OP_CLOSE, CONN_SID), 0);   // the listener is untouched by this
}
```

`user/src/socket_test_client.rs::tcp_accept_inbound` is that sequence with the assertions in it.

**Running the gate.** It is part of the ordinary suite and needs no host setup; xtask picks a free
loopback port, hands it to the runner as `NIFE_HOSTFWD_PORT`, and runs the prober thread itself:

```console
$ script/test                                  # both ISAs, inbound gate included
$ cargo xtask test --arch aarch64              # just the aarch64 leg
```

A plain `cargo xtask run` sets no `NIFE_HOSTFWD_PORT`, so nothing binds a port on your machine
outside a test run.

### The gate: a host process connects to the guest, twice

`hostfwd` is `guestfwd`'s mirror, so this costs no host setup: QEMU listens on a loopback port and
forwards connections to the guest's `10.0.2.15:7778`. The runners add it to the **mmio** NIC only,
and only when `NIFE_HOSTFWD_PORT` is set, which is the test flow and nothing else. That flag is
the one thing here that **binds a port on the developer's machine**, so it stays off a plain
`cargo xtask run` and off the benchmark boot, both of which share the runner.

The port is chosen by xtask, from the OS (`free_loopback_port`), rather than fixed. A fixed port
collides every time two lanes run the suite at once on one machine; an asked-for one collides only if
it is taken between the ask and QEMU's bind, and that failure is loud (QEMU refuses to start).

The host side is `InboundProber`, a thread beside the scanout referee and there for the same reason:
**nothing inside the guest can open a connection to the guest from outside it.** It connects, sends
`nife-in!`, and requires `nife-out!` back. The two strings differ on purpose: an echo would pass
even if the guest were only reflecting our bytes, and the claim is that the guest *composed* an
answer to a connection it did not make. It retries for the whole run, because nothing on the host
knows when the accept test starts; a connection that lands while another net test holds the NIC finds
no listener and is reset by smoltcp, which costs nothing.

It requires **three of the four** connections the guest offers, and the gap is deliberate: two
listeners serve two rounds each, neither can supply more than two, so a host that collected three
collected at least one from each. The second round of each pair is the load-bearing one. A listener
that accepts once and goes deaf would pass a one-connection gate, and is exactly what a file server
cannot use. (It required two, from one listener, until milestone 64 added the `std::net` half; see
the BUGS section below for why the floor is three and not four.)

**A host prober must never abandon a connection because it is slow**, which the first green run
taught by failing in the most instructive way available: the guest passed and the prober reported
serving *zero*. A `connect` to a `hostfwd` port succeeds the moment QEMU accepts the host side; slirp
only then starts the guest side, and nothing answers that SYN until the guest is inside an operation
that polls smoltcp. Dropping the connection on a read timeout does **not** take back the payload
already written: slirp keeps the guest-side connection, completes the handshake whenever the guest
next polls, and delivers those bytes to a socket whose host end has gone. One retry every 100 ms for
a whole boot builds a queue of those, and the guest cheerfully served both of its rounds from
abandoned connections while the prober timed out on its own live one.

The fix is a rule rather than a longer timeout: a **timeout is not a reason to give up** (keep
reading the same connection until it answers, dies, or the run ends), while a **hard error is**, and
a cheap one, because a RST means the guest had no listener and consumed nothing. The general shape is
worth remembering for any host-side actor: an abandoned request may still be executed, so "I gave up
waiting" and "it did not happen" are different claims.

Both halves assert. The guest reports `OK` only if both rounds arrived with the right bytes and its
answers were sent (`a_host_process_connects_to_the_guest_and_is_answered`, both ISAs); the prober
fails the leg if what came back was not the guest's answer. The guest's half covers "somebody
connected"; the host's covers "and got the right answer", which the guest cannot know.

The **grant** half rides in the same exchange, ahead of the first connection: 8080 is refused as a
matter of authority, 7778 binds, and asking for 7778 again on a second socket id reports
`LISTEN_IN_USE`. No frame is attached until all of that has passed, which is the two-object claim
proved by construction rather than by assertion.

### BUGS: the check fails intermittently, and the mechanism is still not identified

**The state of it.** `inbound check (riscv64)` has gone red twice with nothing wrong that anybody
could name, and the floor has already been lowered once (from all four to three) to absorb it. It
must not be lowered again: at three it still proves each of the two listeners answered, and at two it
proves nothing that one listener could not fake. A second lane went hunting on 2026-08-19 and did not
find the mechanism either. What follows is what that lane ruled out and what it measured, so the next
person starts where it stopped rather than where it started.

**The two observations.** Run 32195227733's riscv64 leg served 3 of 4 with all 279 guest tests
passing, on a runner the load instrument called not oversubscribed. On 2026-08-19, on pull request
348, a leg served **2 of 4**, below the floor, with the load average at 1.05 on four cores. So
contention is not the explanation, and the second one is not the same shape as the first.

**Ruled out: the teardown race.** The prober's `report()` sets `stop` after the child exits, and a
connection still waiting at that moment is lost. It cannot be this: the four rounds are answered
around **30 s and 39 s into a boot that runs about 180 s**, so the last one has well over two minutes
of slack before QEMU goes away. Measured over five boots, all four rounds every time.

**Ruled out: the guest quietly serving fewer than four.** Every guest path that serves fewer than two
rounds is loud. `socket_test_client::serve_one_inbound` calls `done(0xE060)`/`done(0xE070)` when
`ACCEPT` returns `REP_ERR`, and `std_exerciser::serve_one_inbound` panics, because the overlay's
`accept` turns the bounded wait's expiry into `WouldBlock` and the exerciser unwraps it. There is
**exactly one silent path**, and it is worth knowing: `virtio_service::start_net_std` and its SMB
sibling begin with `find_net_device()?`, so a leg that cannot find the NIC prints
`(no virtio-net device attached; skipping)` and the test passes having offered nothing. That would
produce **2 of 4 on the nose**, which is the second observation's number.

**How to tell those apart in one look, which is what the prober now prints.** The four rounds come
from two listeners in two windows about eight seconds apart, two rounds each, so the answers cluster.
The prober records every connection's outcome and the timestamp of every answer, and prints the
summary **on a green run too**, which is the half that was missing both times this went red: nobody
had a known-good shape to read the red one against. A green riscv boot looks like this, and it is
stable to within a few hundred milliseconds across five of them:

```console
inbound prober (port 55788): answered x4, closed-empty x1, connect-failed x2, reset x15
    +30179 ms: answered after 29973 ms, 9 bytes
    +30190 ms: answered after 11 ms, 9 bytes
    +38671 ms: answered after 5634 ms, 9 bytes
    +38674 ms: answered after 2 ms, 9 bytes
```

Two clusters with a round missing means the **host** lost one the guest served, and the outcome
recorded beside it says how (`reset`, `closed-partial`, `stopped-while-waiting`, `wrong-bytes`). One
cluster means a whole listener never ran, and the `skipping` line above is the thing to grep for.

**What that transcript also shows, and it is the most alarming number in this section.** Look at the
hold times. The connection that serves round one is opened **at boot** and answered **29973 ms
later**; the one that serves round three is held 5.6 s. The prober offers the guest exactly one
connection at a time and never abandons it, for the good reason two paragraphs down, so throughout
those 30 seconds slirp is retransmitting a single SYN into a guest with no stack yet, **backing off
as it goes**: roughly 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 seconds. The guest's `ACCEPT` waits `service_until`'s
**15 s** and then gives up.

So the gate's first round lands because a SYN whose retransmit interval had grown to about 32 seconds
happened to arrive about a second after the listener came up. **That is a one-second margin against a
fifteen-second cliff**, on a timer nothing here controls, and it is the same shape on every ISA and
every runner; what differs between this laptop and CI is only where in the backoff the guest's
listener happens to appear. It has not been shown to be the mechanism of either observed failure. It
is a measured hazard the design has, it is enough on its own to make the leg's behaviour depend on
an emulator's retransmit timer, and it is where the next lane should look first.

**The proposal that follows from it, not taken here because it could not be measured.** Offer the
guest **several connections at once**, staggered, all held and all read. Every answer is still
collected (nothing is abandoned, so the rule below is kept), but no window ever depends on a SYN
timer that has been backing off for half a minute: there is always a recently-opened connection with
a short one. The extras hit `net_stack`'s one-deep backlog and are reset, which costs nothing and the
prober already handles. It was left undone deliberately: with no reproduction, a green run after the
change is indistinguishable from a green run before it, and this check has been widened once already
on evidence that thin.

**And the aarch64 leg is closer to the cliff than riscv is**, which is worth knowing because the
flake has only ever been seen on riscv. On the same laptop its first round is held **41998 ms**
before it is answered, against riscv's 29973, and its prober logs twenty `connect-failed` attempts
at the start of the boot because it is poking the forwarded port before QEMU has bound it. Nothing
about this hazard is riscv-specific; riscv is simply where it has landed so far.

**Why it does not reproduce on a developer machine.** Five riscv boots on macOS on a quiet Apple
Silicon laptop: 4 of 4 every time, with the timings above, plus one full two-ISA `script/test`. The lane that built the check got 0 in 5
as well. CI runs on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, so the QEMU build, the libslirp version, the host TCP stack
and the core count all differ, and this is an emulator-timing failure. **A reproduction attempt that
is not on that runner class is not a reproduction attempt**; that is the single most useful thing to
know before spending an afternoon on it.

**The runner class was brought to the laptop on 2026-08-19, and the result is one notch short of a
reproduction.** `script/runner-container` boots the leg inside an ubuntu 24.04 aarch64 container on
the developer machine, with `.qemu-version`'s QEMU 11.0.2 built by `script/ci-qemu` (the workflow's
own script, not a package), four processors by affinity, and no induced load. Fifty boots:

- **The gate never went red. 50 of 50 green**, which is a real if narrow statement. At the roughly
  one-in-six rate this failure is estimated to have on CI, fifty clean boots have probability
  1.1e-4, so whatever the container is doing, it is not doing that. Read as a bound rather than as a
  refutation: 0 of 50 puts the 95% one-sided ceiling on the per-boot red rate at **5.8%**, so a
  one-in-twenty flake would have sat inside this run unnoticed.
- **The loss itself reproduced once**, and that is the finding. Run 45 of 50 collected **3 of 4**,
  which is the first CI observation's shape exactly, on a boot whose 279 guest tests all passed. It
  did not turn the leg red only because the floor is three. One in fifty is 2%, 95% CI
  **[0.05%, 10.65%]**, which overlaps the CI estimate at its top end and is a point estimate to
  distrust: it rests on one event.

The trace, beside a green one from the same fifty for comparison:

```console
inbound prober (port 34033): answered x3, closed-empty x2, connect-failed x1, read-failed x1, reset x4
    +15119 ms: read-failed after 15019 ms, 0 bytes
    +21097 ms: answered after 5877 ms, 9 bytes
    +27105 ms: answered after 5579 ms, 9 bytes
    +27108 ms: answered after 3 ms, 9 bytes

inbound prober (port 38119): answered x4, closed-empty x1, connect-failed x1, reset x3
    +18071 ms: answered after 17969 ms, 9 bytes
    +18082 ms: answered after 11 ms, 9 bytes
    +24066 ms: answered after 5527 ms, 9 bytes
    +24070 ms: answered after 3 ms, 9 bytes
```

**Read it the way the failure text says to.** Two clusters, and the first one has one answer where it
should have two, so the host lost a round the guest served. The outcome beside it names how, and it
is not a timeout: `read-failed` is `probe_inbound`'s catch-all `_ =>` arm, reached only by an error
that is not `WouldBlock`, `TimedOut`, `ConnectionReset`, `ConnectionAborted` or `BrokenPipe`. **The
never-abandon rule did not protect this connection, because a hard error is exactly the case that
rule allows to give up on**, and the paragraph above about abandoned requests still being executed
then applies in full: the guest answered into a socket whose host end had gone.

**The connection died at 15019 ms**, held from 100 ms into the boot. That number is not obviously a
coincidence next to `service_until`'s 15 s, and pinning it is the next lane's first job.

**What blocks pinning it today, and it is a two-line fix somebody should make before the next
hunt.** The errno was captured. `probe_inbound` formats it into `last`, and `last` is printed only
when the check FAILS. This run passed, so the one fact that would have named the mechanism was
computed and thrown away. `InboundTrace` should keep the error string on the event rather than only
the label. Not done here on purpose: this lane was measuring, and changing the prober mid-measurement
would have made the fifty boots incomparable with each other.

**The timing is bimodal, deterministically so, and nobody had looked before.** Across the fifty
boots the first round is answered at either **17.95-18.04 s (24 boots)** or **29.97-30.08 s (25
boots)**, with nothing in between and under 100 ms of spread inside each mode; run 45 is the only
outlier. The whole boot follows it, taking ~49 s or ~62 s. Twelve seconds apart is a retransmit
ladder, and the near-even split says the guest's listener comes up **right on top of one of its
rungs** and falls to one side or the other essentially at random. That is the previous lane's
one-second margin, measured from the other end and confirmed: the leg's behaviour is decided by
which rung of an emulator's SYN backoff the listener happens to appear next to. It also means the
laptop's steady 29973 ms is one of two modes rather than the number, so a fix should be judged
against both.

**What the container matches**: the distribution and release, hence libslirp and the scheduler tick;
the emulator, from the same `script/ci-qemu` and the same pin; the provisioning, from
`script/bootstrap`; and the core count, narrowed by affinity rather than by a CFS quota, which is the
difference between four processors and four processors' worth of throttled time on eight.

**What it does not match, and any one of these could be where the missing rate lives**: the kernel is
the podman machine's Fedora CoreOS, not the runner's Ubuntu one; the container is nested inside a VM
on a laptop rather than being the VM; memory is the podman machine's rather than the runner's 16 GiB;
and the image is `ubuntu:24.04` rather than a `runner-images` build. A reproduction here would have
been strong evidence; a clean run is weak evidence, and the honest reading of 50 green is that this
narrows the search rather than closing it.

**Where the next person should start.** Keep the errno, then re-run this. If the rate stays near 2%,
the remaining gap to CI is in the four unmatched things above and the cheapest of them to test is
memory. The proposal in the paragraph below (several staggered connections at once) is now measurable
for the first time: run the fifty boots before and after it and compare the count of lost rounds,
which is a number this instrument produces on green runs and the old evidence never had.

### The std client is a server too: `TcpListener` on this contract (milestone 64)

Everything above is `socket_test_client`, which is hand-written and speaks the wire directly. The
same inbound path is now reachable from **ordinary Rust**: `std::net::TcpListener::bind`, `accept`,
`read_exact`, `write_all`, in a program that names no capability and no socket id
(`patches/std-nife/overlay/std/src/sys/net/connection/nife.rs`). That is the difference between a
crate compiling and a server running, and it is what milestone 55's Samba-shaped workload stands on.

**The binding was mechanical, exactly as this note predicted, and the interesting part is what it
did to the capability graph rather than to the code.** `start_net_std` used to pass
`NO_LISTEN_GRANT` with a comment saying a grant would be authority nothing could spend. It now takes
the grant as a parameter, so **the caller decides**, and the two callers decide differently:

| the stack a `std_exerciser` is spawned over | `TcpListener::bind` | the pinned transcript |
|---|---|---|
| `NO_LISTEN_GRANT` | `PermissionDenied` | `std net on nife` / `listen refused` / `udp ok` / `tcp echo ok` |
| `listen_grant(7778, 7778)` | granted | `std net on nife` / `listen ok` / `denied refused` / `in use refused` / `served 2` |

Both are compared byte for byte on both ISAs, which is what makes the first row a **negative
control** rather than a test that happens not to run: a change that widened the grant check would
turn `listen refused` into `listen ok` and fail in a transcript diff. It costs that boot nothing,
because that test already existed and already spawned a stack with no grant.

**Three answers, three `ErrorKind`s**, and the mapping is the contract's own vocabulary rather than
one invented in the PAL. `LISTEN_DENIED` becomes `PermissionDenied`, which is the one error here a
caller cannot fix by trying elsewhere: no other port helps, because the answer was about authority.
`LISTEN_IN_USE` becomes `AddrInUse`, which is the retryable one. A refused `ACCEPT` (nobody arrived
inside the server's bounded wait) becomes `WouldBlock`, because the listener is still armed and
calling again is the right response.

**What the granted run does not do is the outbound half**, and that is a cost decision made in the
open rather than an oversight. A net test spends minutes in `net_stack`'s userspace smoltcp poll, so
a boot is the expensive unit in this suite; the outbound transcript is already proven by the run that
is refused the port, so the granted run serves and stops.

**One thing the contract cannot tell the PAL, and it is now a fork rather than a gap.**
`std::net::TcpListener::accept` must return a `SocketAddr`, and `OP_ACCEPT`'s reply carries no peer,
so what comes back is `0.0.0.0:0` and `peer_addr()` on an accepted stream reports the same. A server
that logs its peers logs zeros. Two ways to fix it, both changes to what two programs agree on and
therefore neither taken here: a **second reply word** (`reply` already carries two and `OP_ACCEPT`
sends zero in the second), or the **frame's dead `dst` fields**, which is exactly the move a UDP
`RECV` already makes with the datagram's source and would cost no format change at all. The second
is cheaper and has the precedent; both are calef's.

**The host prober now sees two listening windows over one boot, and what it requires changed shape
because of it.** The guest offers four rounds (two per program) and the prober passes at **three**.
That is a provable claim rather than a fudge: neither program can supply more than two, so three
collected means at least one from each, which is exactly the half no in-guest assertion can make.
The *re-arm* claim is not the host's to confirm any more; it is asserted inside each guest test,
where it is actually checkable, and a guest cannot fake a second `accept` returning the right bytes.

**Requiring all four was tried first and measured red.** On CI run 32195227733 the riscv64 leg
reported "the guest served 3 of 4" while **all 279 guest tests passed**, on a machine the script's
own load instrument called not oversubscribed. So the guest served four and the host collected
three: one answer went somewhere the prober was not reading. Five local riscv boots did not
reproduce it, which puts it near one in six on that runner class.

**The mechanism is not identified, and that is stated rather than guessed at.** The candidate this
note already describes is a connection the prober abandoned that slirp still delivered ("an
abandoned request may still be executed"), which would let the guest serve a round nobody was
collecting; the other is a teardown race on the very last round, since that test's program exits and
its `net_stack` is reclaimed immediately afterwards. Neither is confirmed. What is confirmed is that
this is the intermittent red notes/net.md already records misleading three separate milestones, so
the gate was made robust to losing one round rather than left claiming something it cannot deliver
six runs out of six. Identifying it wants a lane of its own.

### The aarch64 test boot has run out of memory, and this is the receipt

That grant half wanted a test of its own, and could not have one. A second `net_stack` spawn costs a
**192-page untyped region that nothing ever reclaims** (`NET_SERVER_BUDGET_PAGES`), because the
server blocks in its serve loop forever and no supervisor reaps it. With two extra net servers in the
boot, a later test asking for 128 contiguous pages found **137 free frames and no run that long**;
the failure surfaced far away, as `time_tests` reporting "no swish program in the initrd archive, or
no memory to wire one", which reads like a packaging bug and is not one.

**The fix taken here was to stop over-provisioning.** `NET_SERVER_BUDGET_PAGES` was 192 on the
recorded reasoning that `net_stack` caps its heap at 128 pages "so 192 leaves headroom without being
unbounded", which is a margin nobody measured. It is now **128**, with `net_stack`'s `HEAP_MAX`
lowered to **96** so the budget still covers the heap's declared worst case with 32 pages for page
tables and clients' frame mappings. Ten net servers per boot at 64 pages saved each is **640 frames**
returned, which is six times what the new gate spends. The suite is what proves 96 is enough.

Three facts worth carrying forward, because milestones 54, 55 and 66 will all want more net tests:

- **RAM is pinned at 128 MiB and asserted.** `memory_map_came_from_the_device_tree` fails on any
  other size, deliberately, because a wrong number there means a misparsed `reg`. So "give QEMU more
  memory" is a decision with a test attached, not a knob.
- **The margin before this milestone was about 315 frames**, 1.3 MiB, at the end of the aarch64
  boot. One net test spends ~208 of them permanently (192 for the server, 16 for the client), so the
  suite could afford exactly one more net test and not two.
- **It is exhaustion, and it was measured, not inferred.** A temporary instrument in
  `untyped::create` printed `free=107, largest_run>=96` at the failing allocation, which settles the
  question a total-free number alone leaves open. Worth repeating if this bites again: the
  instrument is four lines and it turned "somebody's test is flaky" into a number in one run.

The fix is the same one `virtio::MAX_DEVICES` has now asked for eight times: reclaim what a dead or
finished service held. It is one piece of work that would relieve both ceilings, and it is
increasingly what stands between this suite and the next network milestone.

**And the margin is now thin enough to fail about one run in three, measured.** When milestones 54
and 55 were merged together (the SMB adapter and the mDNS half now ride the same spawn as milestone
107's accept test, which is why neither cost a net server of its own), the aarch64 leg was run three
times on the merged tree: **one of the three died**, and it died exactly the way this section and
notes/swish-language.md both predict. `time_tests::a_shell_with_no_usable_clock_refuses_rather_than_running_it_unmeasured`
printed `refused to load a user program: Unmappable(OutOfFrames)` and the lost-wakeup watchdog fired
sixty seconds later; the other two runs passed all 261 tests with every prober green. Two things
follow, and the second is the one that costs time. **A red aarch64 leg on a branch that touches the
net tests is not evidence the branch is wrong**, so re-run before you debug. And **the failure names
a test that has nothing to do with the change**, because the boot's last spawn is the one that pays,
which is what makes this so expensive to diagnose from the failure alone. That is the third distinct
milestone to be misled by it, and it is the argument for reclaim being a milestone rather than a
cleanup.

**Postscript, 2026-08-16: that one-in-three did not reproduce on the lane that fixed this**, and the
honest reading of that is worth more than a tidier one. Twelve aarch64 runs at the pre-fix commit
under TCG and eight on the physical core (`--hvf`) were all green on one developer's machine. What
*did* reproduce, on every single run, is the margin the paragraph above is really about: **216 free
frames of 29307 and no free run longer than 117**. With that little headroom, which test dies is
decided by scheduling, so a rate measured on one machine on one day is a property of the machine as
much as of the tree. Reproduce the margin, not the failure.

### The reclamation landed, 2026-08-16, and here is what it cost and returned

The prediction above was right about the cause and wrong about the size of it: **the net services
were the second biggest spender, not the first.** Measured across a whole aarch64 boot with the frame
ledger (notes/frames.md), the ten net tests held **2759 frames**; the six `spawn_init` tests held
**12289**. Both are fixed, and the note is corrected rather than quietly updated, because "we knew
which one it was" is exactly the kind of claim this file exists to keep honest.

What a net test now does at the end: `net.release_or_fail("a net test's net_stack")`, which is
`kill_thread` on the server and its clients, then `reclaim_region` on each region, retried. No new
verb, no syscall change.

**The one thing that had to change in the kernel, and it is worth understanding here rather than
only in `sched.rs`:** `net_stack` blocks in `recv_cap(STACK)` forever, and DECISIONS §16's armed kill
is spent by `schedule()`, which a `Blocked` thread never reaches. Killing it did nothing. What ends
it is that reclaiming a region **removes the endpoints inside it and aborts whoever is blocked on
them** (§32's endpoint reap), and that sweep now runs *before* the live-thread refusal instead of
after it. So the server's three endpoints come out of a four-page region of their own, and reclaiming
that region is what wakes it up to die. From `create_endpoint`'s shared kernel chunks there is no such
handle, and there was no way to end a `net_stack` short of rebooting the machine.

The measured result for the boot as a whole: **216 free frames at the end became 15307, and the
longest free run went from 117 to 14080.** (15249 on the merged tree, which runs one more process in
the SMB test; notes/frames.md carries the remeasurement. The free run, which is the number that
decides whether a boot lives, is 14080 either way.)

Two things this does **not** fix, both recorded rather than papered over:

- **`virtio::MAX_DEVICES` is untouched.** `virtio::register` bumps a counter and never reuses a slot,
  so the receipts in that constant's comment still stand: the boot's ceiling is still "how many
  devices has this boot ever wired". Reusing a slot safely needs a generational name on the device
  table, because a stale `Object::Virtio` capability must not alias a fresh device, and that is a
  capability-semantics change rather than a counter change. Its own lane. **Milestone 64 paid the
  ninth receipt** (33, for the listener gate's second `net_stack`) and confirmed the other half of
  the prediction from the other side: the memory ceiling really is gone, so what is left is only the
  counter.
- **The DMA page and the shadow ring are deliberately not returned**, ~2 frames per net service. The
  NIC still holds whatever receive buffers the dead driver posted, and handing those pages back to the
  allocator would let a live device write into somebody else's memory. Ending that safely means
  resetting the device at teardown, through the transport seam. Also its own lane.

### What is still not proven, and what is deliberately out of scope

- **`std::net::TcpListener` is bound** (milestone 64, 2026-08-18; this bullet used to say it was
  still `Unsupported`). The prediction above was right in every particular: `bind` is `OP_LISTEN` on
  a client-allocated socket id, `accept` is `OP_ACCEPT` into another one the PAL allocates and
  attaches a frame to, and the std client's stack is now spawned with a real listen grant. See "The
  std client is a server too" below, and notes/std.md.
- **Only the mmio transport carries the inbound gate.** A PCIe twin would need a second host port,
  and the transport is orthogonal to the accept path, which the outbound gates already prove over
  both buses. This is the same reasoning that retired the PCIe DNS variant.
- **Inbound UDP is now built, and it is a grant of its own** (milestone 55's mDNS stack half; this
  bullet used to say "not built"). `BIND_UDP` claims a fixed UDP port the way `LISTEN` claims a TCP
  one, checked against a **UDP bind grant** the spawn site packs into the high half of the same
  spawn word the listen grant rides in (`socket_proto::udp_bind_grant`; the halves are independent
  authorities, and the zero word still grants nothing anywhere). It answers with `LISTEN`'s own
  vocabulary because the three outcomes are properties of claiming a port, not of TCP. In the same
  change, a UDP `RECV` reply now carries the datagram's **source endpoint** in the frame's dst
  fields (dead space on a reply), because a responder must see who asked and RFC 6762 §6.7 turns on
  the querier's source port; the TFTP gate consumes it by ACKing to the DATA packet's reported
  source, which is what TFTP's TID scheme wanted all along. The stack also joins 224.0.0.251 at
  startup (smoltcp's `multicast` feature, switched on in the same milestone). The whole story,
  including what QEMU can and cannot prove about multicast, is notes/mdns.md's.
