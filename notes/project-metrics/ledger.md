# The cost ledger: what was paid, and what a token lists for

**This file is appended to and never regenerated.** Every other file in this directory is written by
a script from evidence the tree already holds, and rerunning the script reproduces it byte for byte.
This one holds facts no script can derive: what a person paid, on what day, and what a vendor was
charging at the time. `script/metrics` reads it to fill two columns of
[`weekly.csv`](weekly.csv) and nothing writes it back.

So the rule is the one a ledger has always had. **Add a row; do not edit a row.** A figure that turns
out to be wrong gets a new row with a date and a note saying what it corrects, because the point of a
ledger is that somebody can see what was believed when.

Every date here is UTC, like every date in this tree.

## Hardware

Bought for this project, in the order it was bought.

| date | item | price (USD) | source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-15 | **argon**, NVIDIA Jetson TX1 developer kit, used | 89.99 | milestone 127 (the seL4 machine: a Jetson TX1, so identical silicon referees the comparison), which records [the purchase and the delivery window](../../design/roadmap/127-the-sel4-machine.md) |
| 2026-08-15 | **xenon**, Dell OptiPlex 7050 Micro (i5-7500T, 16 GB, 256 GB NVMe) with AC adapter | 139.00 | milestone 87 (the x86_64 bare-metal machine), whose [block](../../design/roadmap/87-x86-machine.md) records the purchase |
| 2026-08-15 | xenon's Dell C4PDJ serial module, with cable | 18.88 | milestone 87 (the x86_64 bare-metal machine) |
| 2026-08-15 | FTDI USB-to-RS-232 adapter, 1.5 ft, for xenon's dev side | 15.96 | milestone 87 (the x86_64 bare-metal machine) |
| 2026-08-15 | StarTech NM9FF null-modem barrel | 7.98 | milestone 87 (the x86_64 bare-metal machine) |
| | **recorded total** | **271.81** | |

### What is missing, named rather than estimated

- **radon**, the StarFive VisionFive 2, is the second ISA's board and **no purchase record exists in
  this tree.** `notes/riscv-port.md` says "a ~$70 StarFive VisionFive 2", which is a sentence about
  the market written before the board was chosen, not a receipt. The order date is not recorded
  either; the board arrived around 2026-08-21. This row is left out rather than filled with the $70,
  because a ledger that guesses is worth less than one with a hole in it. calef can close it in one
  line.
- **The UART adapters and smart plugs on the bench rig** are unpriced for the same reason. Milestone
  87 prices a smart plug at "$15 and works on anything" as part of an argument for choosing one, not
  as a record of buying one.
- **Everything before 2026-08-15.** The first five weeks of the project bought no hardware, which is
  a fact rather than a gap: it ran entirely under QEMU on a machine calef already owned.

**The machine this is built on is not in this ledger and should not be.** patagonia is calef's own
Mac and predates the project; charging a laptop he already had to nife would be inventing a cost.
The same goes for cordoba, which runs the family's backups and was never bought for this.

### A correction this ledger makes to milestone 519's own block

Milestone 519 (what this project costs, tracked where it cannot rot) has a table saying "xenon was
not bought for this project". **That is wrong**, and milestone 87's record is the reason: the
OptiPlex was selected on 2026-08-03 and bought on 2026-08-15 specifically as the dedicated bring-up
machine for the third ISA target that DECISIONS §19 (architectural parity is a tenet; the targets
are aarch64, riscv64, and x86_64) names, and its own block says it "completes when the machine has
printed a byte over serial". It is as much
a project purchase as argon is. Correcting it triples the recorded hardware figure, from $89.99 to
$271.81, and it is recorded here rather than silently: the block's number was written from memory in
the conversation that minted the milestone, and the tree disagreed.

## Subscriptions

| from | to | item | rate | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-12 | (current) | Claude subscription, the inference this project runs on | 200.00 / month | calef, 2026-09-21 |

**The billing day is an assumption and it is the only one in this file.** No invoice is recorded
anywhere in this tree, so `script/metrics` places each charge in the ISO week containing the monthly
anniversary of the start date: 2026-07-12, 2026-08-12, 2026-09-12, and so on. If the real billing
day is different, at most one charge lands in a neighbouring week and the running total is unchanged.

**Why `cash_spend` is lumpy, and why it disagrees with a figure you may have seen.** Milestone 519's
block says "about $470 to date", which is 2.35 months of subscription **accrued** over the ten weeks
since the first commit. `cash_spend` is what was **paid**, so it puts $200 in three weeks and nothing
in the other seven, and sums to $600 by 2026-09-21. Both numbers are correct and they are answers to
different questions. The column is the paid one because milestone 519's own table defines it that
way, and because an accrual is derivable from this ledger by anyone who wants it while a payment is
not derivable from an accrual.

## Retail rates per million tokens

**This is a shadow price and nothing else.** This project pays a fixed monthly subscription, so the
marginal cost of one more lane is **zero dollars**. These rates answer a different question, which is
what somebody without that subscription would pay a vendor to reproduce the same work. Milestone 519
says both figures are legitimate and that quoting one while implying the other is the dishonest
version, so: the paid number is `cash_spend` above, the shadow number is this table times the token
counts in [`effort.csv`](effort.csv), and neither is ever printed without its label.

Rates are list prices on the date recorded, in USD per million tokens.

| recorded | model | input | cache write 5m | cache write 1h | cache read | output | source |

**Source a**: the `claude-api` skill bundled with the agent harness (version 2.1.277), whose model
table carries input and output prices and is itself dated 2026-06-24, and whose
`shared/prompt-caching.md` gives the cache multipliers: a write is 1.25x input at the five-minute
time-to-live and 2x at the one-hour one, and a read is 0.1x input. The four cache columns above are
that arithmetic, written out so a reader does not have to redo it and so a future rate change is a
new row rather than a new formula.

**Source b**: the same file records `claude-fable-5-1` as the exception to the read multiplier, at
0.025x rather than 0.1x. It is 0.3% of this project's tokens, so it changes no total that matters;
it is written down because a rounded-off exception is how a table stops being checkable.

**A model with no row here is priced at nothing and counted at nothing.** `<synthetic>` is the
harness's own label for a response it generated locally, with zero tokens on it, and it has no rate
because no vendor billed for it. If a model appears in `effort.csv` with no row here,
`script/metrics` leaves that week's blended rate blank rather than pricing part of the week, because
a rate derived from three quarters of a week's tokens is not that week's rate.

## BUGS

- **Nothing checks this file against reality.** There is no receipt, no invoice, no API bill in the
  tree, and no gate that could tell a typo from a purchase. It is exactly as reliable as the person
  who typed it, which is the property every ledger has had and is worth saying once.
- **The rates are list prices, read from a document, on one day.** They are not what anyone was
  charged, they do not include any discount, batch rate or tier, and they will drift. A rate change
  is a new row; until somebody adds one, `script/metrics` prices every week at the newest row it has,
  so a rate that changed silently would restate old weeks at the new price. That is the same
  restatement hazard `notes/project-metrics.md` opens with, and it is worse here because a dollar
  figure reads as a measurement.
- **Hardware is not amortised and not depreciated.** A board bought in 2026W33 lands entirely in
  2026W33. Over a project this short that is the honest shape; over a longer one it would make a
  purchase week look like a spending problem.
- **calef's time is not in this file and never will be.** Milestone 519 refuses time tracking, and
  the standing datum is one calendar week of full-time work per calendar week, carried in
  `weekly.csv`'s `human_person_weeks` column. At any plausible rate for an experienced engineer's
  time it is the overwhelming majority of what this project has cost, and a ledger of cash alone
  would invite a reader to forget that.
