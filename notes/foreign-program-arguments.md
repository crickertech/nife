# What one shim costs: the measurement §170 asked for

*(For [§170 (how a foreign program is told what to do)](../design/decisions/170-how-a-foreign-program-is-told-what-to-do.md),
which gates milestone 205 (how a foreign program is told what to do). Measured 2026-09-25 by lane
`lane/argv-shim-measure`. This page's stem is provisional, per the naming tenet; calef names things.
It measures and does not rule: the maintainer amends §170 from it.)*

§170 set the test in one sentence. If a shim is per-program work, option A (a POSIX argv) wins. If
it is a library written once, options B and C stay open. This page answers that with counts from
the tree, from `ripgrep` 14.1.1 and `gitoxide` 0.59.0 source, and from a host-tested prototype.

## The answer

A shim is two jobs, and they answer the question differently.

1. Transport: getting bytes into `std::env::args()`. This is a library, written once, and every
   option needs it. Nothing else reaches an unmodified program, because both programs measured here
   read their arguments from `std::env::args_os()` and from nowhere else.
2. Designation: deciding which of those bytes name something, so the launcher can grant it as a
   capability. This is per-program work. Only the program knows its grammar, and the grammar is
   large and changes by release.

So option A costs the transport alone. Option B, in the token-by-token form §170 describes, costs
the transport plus a per-program table. Option C cannot carry `ripgrep`'s pattern at all without
first adding the transport.

## Transport, measured by writing it

The prototype is a length-prefixed block and the `std` file that reads it. It was written and
host-tested in a scratch crate and is not in this tree, because its layout is the irreversible part
and belongs to the ruling.

| piece | size | shape it copies |
|---|---|---|
| the layout codec (build and parse) | 39 lines of code, 4 host tests passing | `crates/environment_protocol` |
| `sys/args/nife.rs` in the `std` overlay | 11 lines of code | std's own `sys/args/xous.rs`, 19 lines |
| `xtask std-src` dispatch | 2 anchors, 1 generated-module job | the `sys/env/mod.rs` arm in `xtask/src/farm.rs` |
| the spawner's half | one read-only mapping and one `grant_at` | slot 7, the config page, in `kernel/src/user/std_service.rs` |

The layout: an 8-byte magic, a `u32` count, a `u32` total length, then each argument as a `u32`
length and its bytes. Length-prefixed so an argument may hold any byte, including the `0xff` the
round-trip test puts in a regex. A zeroed or truncated block reads as no arguments, the same
default-honest shape `environment_protocol` uses.

The second anchor exists because std compiles `sys/args/common.rs` only for a listed set of
platforms. Adding nife to that list lets the nife file reuse std's `Args` type, as Xous and Motor
do. The alternative is a self-contained `Args`, as zkvm has in 94 lines.

It costs nothing in the syscall surface: no new syscall number and no new method. It rides
`PageFrame` and `MAP_INTO`, which slots 5 and 7 already use. There is a cheaper wire still: std's
`_start` receives three entry registers and ignores all three
(`patches/std-nife/overlay/std/src/sys/pal/nife/mod.rs`), so the block's address and length could
arrive there with no slot at all.

## Designation, measured per program

### `ripgrep` 14.1.1

`ripgrep` parses with its own `lexopt`-based code and reads `std::env::args_os().skip(1)`
(`crates/core/flags/parse.rs:72` and `:103`). Counted from `crates/core/flags/defs.rs`:

| | count |
|---|---|
| flags | 104 |
| switches | 69 |
| flags taking a value | 35 |
| flags with a short letter | 41 |
| value flags that designate a file | 2: `--file`, `--ignore-file` |
| value flags that name a program to run | 2: `--pre`, `--hostname-bin` |

The rest are inert data: numbers, globs, separators, encodings, type names, and the pattern
itself. Positionals follow a rule no table expresses: the first is the pattern unless `-e` or `-f`
was given, and every other positional is a path.

A per-program binder for `ripgrep` therefore needs all 104 arities. Without them it cannot find
the positionals: in `rg -g foo bar`, only the table says `foo` belongs to `-g`. It also needs one
hand-written rule for the pattern. The generic half is getopt's conventions (bundled short flags,
attached values, `--flag=value`, `--`). `lexopt` 0.3.0 is 571 lines of code for exactly that.

### `gitoxide` 0.59.0, the second program

Milestone 99 (`git` on nife) chose gitoxide. Its `gix` binary parses with `clap` derive and reads
`gix::env::args_os()`, which is `std::env::args_os()` with optional Unicode precomposition
(`gix-0.74.1/src/env.rs:25`). So the same transport serves it with no program-specific work.

Its designation table is larger. `src/plumbing/options/` and `src/porcelain/options.rs` declare 260
argument fields across nested subcommands. Of these, 32 are `PathBuf` and 57 are `BString`, which
carry pathspecs and ref names. A binder would need that tree, per release.

`clap` can report part of it. `Arg::get_value_hint` answers `AnyPath` for any `PathBuf` argument
(`clap_builder-4.6.7/src/builder/arg.rs:4372`), so a build step could derive the path flags of a
`clap` program. That covers neither `ripgrep`, which does not use `clap`, nor gitoxide's pathspecs.

### The result for §170's test

The transport is one library and serves both programs unchanged. The designation table is
per-program: 104 flags plus a custom rule for one, 260 fields for the other, and neither is
derivable in general.

## Option C cannot say `rg pattern`

`grant_plan::Endowment` carries `arg: u64` and `flags: u64`. The shell parses the argument with
`parse_u64` (`crates/grant_plan/src/lib.rs:2383`) and refuses anything else as `ArgRequired`. A
regex is not a `u64`, and `ripgrep`'s 104 flags do not fit a 64-bit mask. C as written needs a
string channel first, which is the transport above.

C is per-program by construction beyond that. `Prog` is a closed enum of 16 programs with their
manifests compiled into `grant_plan`, so each foreign program is a new variant and a new manifest.
None of the 16 is a std program today.

## The three options, priced

| | transport | per-program work | syscall surface | runs unmodified `rg` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A: argv | about 50 lines in `std` and a layout crate, plus about 10 in the spawner | none | nothing new | yes |
| B: token-grained | the same | a table per program and release (`rg` 104 flags and a rule, `gix` 260 fields), plus a generic binder of `lexopt`'s size | nothing new | yes, while the table matches the release |
| C: `grant_plan` only | must be added first | a `Prog` variant and manifest per program, plus B's table | nothing new | no, until a string field exists |

There is a fourth reading of B that §170 does not list, and every system in the prior art below
uses it. Arguments travel as inert bytes, and authority travels separately as a namespace: the
directories a program was handed. That costs what A costs. A path string can then reach only what
the namespace holds. `ripgrep` already behaves this way here: it resolves names under slot 4, and
the `std` PAL refuses `..` and absolute paths before they reach the wire.

## What A asks two programs to agree on

This is the irreversible list, the part a ruling fixes:

- where the block is: a slot and a virtual address (slot 8 and `0x1400_0000`, one page above the
  config page, would follow its pattern), or the entry registers;
- the layout: magic, count, total, length-prefixed bytes;
- whether `argv[0]` is present. It must be: `ripgrep` skips the first element and `clap` treats it
  as the binary name, so a block without it would lose the pattern;
- bytes, not UTF-8, because `args_os` is `OsString` and a path need not be text;
- a size ceiling. One page leaves 4,080 bytes for arguments;
- whether the environment rides in the same block, as Fuchsia and Genode do, or stays on the
  validated page of §111 (inert configuration is a read-only page).

## Prior art, read from source

- Fuchsia, `zircon/system/public/zircon/processargs.h`. The bootstrap message carries `args_off`
  and `args_num` (NUL-terminated UTF-8 strings), `environ_off` and `environ_num`, and a name table
  for `PA_NS_DIR` handles. Strings and authority travel in one message but in different fields: a
  path in argv names something in the namespace handles. The ELF runner's manifest `args` is a
  vector of strings passed in order. Structured configuration (`PA_VMO_COMPONENT_CONFIG`) is the
  B-shaped channel, and it sits beside argv rather than replacing it.
- Genode, `repos/libports/include/libc/args.h`. `populate_args_and_env` reads `<arg>` and `<env>`
  nodes from the component's config ROM and builds `argv` and `envp` System V style, once, in libc.
  `construct.cc` then calls `main(argc, argv, envp)`. What a component may touch is routed
  separately as sessions (from memory, not re-read for this page).
- seL4. The kernel has no argv. `sel4runtime`'s entry finds `argc`, `argv`, `envp` and `auxv` on
  the stack, and `libsel4utils/src/process.c` writes them there when a parent spawns a child
  (`sel4utils_stack_copy_args`). Its own `sel4utils_create_word_args` formats integers as decimal
  strings to send them through argv. Microkit passes no argv; `setvar` rewrites symbols in the image
  at build time.
- Xous, in std itself (`library/std/src/sys/args/xous.rs`, `sys/pal/xous/params.rs`). A Rust
  microkernel's loader passes a pointer to a parameter block as the second entry argument. Tagged
  blocks (`AppP`, `EnvB`, an argument list) carry arguments and environment. This is the nearest
  neighbour to what A would build here.

None of the four delivers arguments as capabilities. All four deliver bytes and keep authority in a
separate channel.

## BUGS

- The prototype was not booted. It proves the layout round-trips on the host. It does not prove
  `ripgrep` searches here, because the kernel wiring and a local QEMU run were outside this
  measurement.
- The shell cannot spawn a std program at all. All 16 `grant_plan::Prog` entries are native, and
  `ripgrep` runs only from the kernel test harness (`fs_service::start_std_full`). Every option
  inherits this gap. The demonstration at the prompt that milestone 121 (`ripgrep` on nife) wants
  needs it closed. Proposed to the maintainer as a milestone of its own. *Partly closed
  2026-09-26 by milestone 595 (provisional), in which the shell runs a `std` program: the
  progenitor builds `std`'s layout and `std_exerciser` runs from the prompt. `rg` still cannot,
  because it needs arguments, which is the subject of this note.*
- gitoxide has not been built for a nife target. Its argument path was read from source, not run.
- The counts are source counts from one release of each program. `ripgrep`'s flag count was taken
  with a script over `impl Flag for` blocks, and gitoxide's by matching field declarations. Either
  could be off by a few; neither could be off by enough to make a table small.
- A byte argv can carry a secret. §111 refused free-form strings on the config page for exactly
  that reason, and validation cannot help here, because a regex is arbitrary bytes. Neither
  program measured takes a secret on its command line. The risk is real for others and would need
  a policy answer, not a wire one.
