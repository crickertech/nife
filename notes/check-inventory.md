# Every check in this repository: does anything run it, does it block, and what does green mean

Milestone 232 (audit every check against two questions: does anything run it, and does it block).
Measured on **2026-09-03** against `a0059022`, on patagonia and against the live repository
settings. Every number below was taken by running the thing or by reading the API, not recalled.

**Why an inventory and not a sweep of new gates.** Four findings on 2026-09-02 each showed this
tree's verification reporting something that was not true, and no two were the same defect:
milestone 214 (a test that prints "skipping" and returns is counted as passed), milestone 222 (the
one command a person runs before pushing has a leg that fails instead of skipping), milestone 230
(`script/shell-check` is red on `main`, on both architectures, and nothing says so), and milestone
233 (`login` dies on every boot, and the boot says it is ready). A test that lies, a gate that fails
instead of skipping, a check nothing runs, and a check that passes while what it names is dead.
`script/lint` has had three checks deleted for the "only ever rejects legitimate work" signature, so
the answer to four bad checks is not six more.

## How to re-run this audit

```
gh api repos/crickertech/nife/rulesets                                    # find the ruleset id
gh api repos/crickertech/nife/rulesets/19596094 \
  --jq '.rules[] | select(.type=="required_status_checks")
        | .parameters.required_status_checks[].context'                   # what blocks
grep -n 'name:' .github/workflows/*.yml                                   # what runs
for w in .github/workflows/*.yml; do
    gh run list --workflow "$(basename "$w")" --limit 6 \
        --json conclusion,event,createdAt; done                           # what is red
```

The third command is the one that pays. Two of the five findings below are visible only in run
history and in nothing that lives in this tree.

## The three questions, and which one has teeth

1. **Does anything run it?** An entry point nothing calls has whatever result somebody last saw.
2. **Does it block?** CI runs nineteen checks on a pull request and the `main` ruleset requires
   eleven. The other eight are worth deciding rather than inheriting.
3. **What does a green result actually assert?** This is the one an inventory cannot answer by
   listing. `script/shell-check` was green while `login` was dead on every boot; that check ran and
   would have blocked, and its passing simply meant less than its name.

## A. The workflow jobs

Nineteen check names reach a pull request. "Blocks" means the name is in ruleset 19596094's
`required_status_checks`.

| check name | workflow | trigger | blocks | result 2026-09-03 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `build + test (host + QEMU)` | ci | PR, merge queue, push | **yes** | green |
| `rustfmt` | ci | PR, merge queue, push | **yes** | green |
| `clippy` | ci | PR, merge queue, push | **yes** | green |
| `cpu matrix (riscv64 across QEMU CPU models)` | ci | PR, merge queue, push | **yes** | green |
| `bench (icount regression tripwire)` | ci | PR, merge queue, push | **yes** | green |
| `coverage (host crates)` | ci | PR, merge queue, push | **yes** | green |
| `supply chain (advisories, licences, vendored integrity)` | ci | PR, merge queue, push | **yes** | green |
| `fastpath footprint (the IPC path must stay L1i-sized)` | ci | PR, merge queue, push | **yes** | green |
| `stack frames (no frame over a third of a thread stack)` | ci | PR, merge queue, push | **yes** | green |
| `fuzz (parsers, 60s per target)` | ci | PR, merge queue, push | **yes** | green |
| `verify (Kani proofs)` | verify | PR, merge queue, push | **yes** | green |
| `image permissions (no kernel image ships a writable-executable segment)` | ci | PR, merge queue, push | no | green |
| `re-falsify the harnesses this change can reach` | verify | PR, merge queue, push | no | green today, **was red through a merge** |
| `architect hold (needs-architect label)` | architect-hold | PR, merge queue | no | green |
| `verify scope` | verify | PR, merge queue, push | no | green |
| `prove (shard 1/2)`, `prove (shard 2/2)` | verify | PR, merge queue, push | no | green |
| `draft gate` (two jobs, one name) | ci, verify | PR, merge queue, push | no | green |

Three of the unrequired five are correct as they stand. `verify scope` and the two `prove` shards
are aggregated by `verify (Kani proofs)`, which is required and which fails unless scope succeeded
and every shard reported `success` or `skipped`; requiring the shards as well would add names to
keep in sync and catch nothing. `draft gate` produces an output rather than a verdict.

The scheduled workflows, which nothing blocks by construction:

| workflow | cadence | last result | what it is for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mutation testing` | 05:00 UTC Monday | **failure, and it has never once succeeded** | milestone 85 (mutation testing over the host crates), the instrument behind fatal risk 3 |
| `undefined-behavior check` | 06:00 UTC Monday | **failure 08-10, 08-17, 08-24; cancelled 08-31** | milestone 79 (Miri over the host crates) |
| `toolchain drift` | 07:00 UTC daily | failure 09-02, 09-03 | builds against the newest nightly; red is its signal, not a defect on `main` |
| `audit cadence` | weekly | failure 08-17, 08-24, 08-31 | red means an audit is due; two are |
| `falsification sweep` | 06:00 UTC Monday | **never run** | added 2026-08-31; first fire 2026-09-07 |
| `project metrics` | 06:00 UTC Monday | **never run** | added 2026-09-02 by milestone 234 (the project's own numbers, one row per ISO week); first fire 2026-09-07 |
| `stranger cadence` | weekly | success | milestone 117 (the stranger test) |
| `vendor watch` | weekly | success | has upstream moved |
| `toolchain bump` | weekly | success | proposes a pin bump |

## B. The `script/` entry points

Fifty files. Not all of them are checks: `apropos`, `bootstrap`, `setup`, `update`, `console`,
`server`, `initboot`, `board-console`, `board-image`, `catch-up`, `qemu-check`, `ci-qemu` and
`runner-container` are tools or provisioning. What follows is every entry point that renders a
verdict or a measurement, and who calls it.

| script | called by | blocks a merge | result 2026-09-03 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fmt --check` | `script/gates`, ci `rustfmt`, the `pre-push` hook | yes | green |
| `lint` | `script/gates`, ci `clippy` | yes | green |
| `test` | `script/gates`, ci via `ci-build`, `toolchain-drift` | yes | green |
| `shell-check` | `script/gates`, ci via `ci-build` (as `cargo xtask shell-check`) | yes, inside `build + test` | green |
| `icount` | `script/gates`, ci `bench` | yes | green |
| `image-permissions` | `script/gates`, ci `image permissions` | **no** | green |
| `bench --check` | ci `bench` | yes | green |
| `coverage` | ci `coverage`, `script/metrics` | yes | green |
| `cpu-matrix` | ci `cpu matrix` | yes | green |
| `fastpath-footprint` | ci `fastpath footprint` | yes | green |
| `stack-frame-check` | ci `stack frames` | yes | green |
| `stack-depth-check` | ci `stack frames` (same job) | yes | green |
| `fuzz` | ci `fuzz` | yes | green |
| `supply-chain` | ci `supply chain`, `vendor-watch` | yes | green |
| `vendor-verify` | `script/supply-chain`, `vendor-watch` | yes, transitively | green |
| `verify` | `verify.yml` `prove` shards | yes, via `verify (Kani proofs)` | green |
| `falsifications --affected-since` | `verify.yml` `falsify` | **no** | green |
| `falsifications --check` | `script/lint` | yes | green |
| `roadmap --check` | `script/lint` | yes | green |
| `decisions --check` | `script/lint` | yes | green |
| `citations --check` | `script/lint` | yes | green |
| `names --check` | `script/lint` | yes | green |
| `audits --check` | `script/lint` | yes | green |
| `stranger-test --check` | `script/lint` | yes | green |
| `audits --due` | `audit-cadence.yml` | no | **red, and correctly: two audits are due** |
| `stranger-test --due` | `stranger-cadence.yml` | no | green |
| `mutation` | `mutation.yml` | no | **red every week since it was written** |
| `undefined-behavior-check` | `undefined-behavior-check.yml` | no | **red** |
| `drift` | `toolchain-drift.yml` | no | red (against a nightly newer than the pin) |
| `metrics` | `metrics.yml` | no | unknown, never run |
| `vendor-watch` | `vendor-watch.yml` | no | green |
| `toolchain-bump` | **nothing** | no | unknown; `toolchain-bump.yml` reimplements a subset |
| `interleaving-check` | **nothing** | no | **green, measured today, 12 seconds** |
| `crate-probes` | **nothing** | no | **green, measured today, 43 of 50, about 3 minutes** |
| `repeat-under-load` | `script/runner-container`, which nothing calls | no | unknown |
| `soak` | **nothing** | no | unknown |
| `rule-violations --check` | **nothing** | no | green (2 open strikes, threshold 3) |
| `journeys` | **nothing** | no | report only, cannot fail |
| `apropos`, `catch-up` | **nothing** | no | tools, no verdict |

`script/lint` is one required check carrying **38 sub-checks** (nine clippy passes and 29 others,
the list is its own `==>` lines). They all block, because it exits on the first failure. That
concentration is worth knowing: a slow or wrong sub-check there stalls every lane at once, which is
why three have been deleted rather than fixed.

## C. Checks that are neither a script nor a workflow job

An inventory that stopped at `script/` and `.github/` would miss the two mechanisms the four
2026-09-02 findings actually left behind, because both live inside the thing under test.

- **`Testable::run` in `kernel/src/testing.rs`** panics when a test printed the word `skip` and set
  no skip reason. That is milestone 214's rung-two answer, it runs inside every `script/test` boot,
  and it blocks. Its own limits are recorded in that milestone's block: it reads a substring rather
  than a structure, and a reason split across two `write_str` fragments is missed.
- **The killed-thread assertion in `script/shell-check`** fails the run if the kernel reported
  killing any user thread, on both architectures. That is milestone 233's answer to a check that
  passed while `login` was dead, and it was proven able to fail before being believed.

## What a green result asserts, where that is not obvious

Six checks pass for reasons narrower than their names. Every one of these is already recorded
somewhere in the tree; collecting them is the point.

- **`build + test (host + QEMU)`, `bench`, `coverage`, `cpu matrix` and `verify (Kani proofs)` are
  green-by-skip on a documentation-only change.** Each guards its *steps* on a predicate
  (`^(notes/|design/|[A-Z_]+\.md$)`) while the job still runs, deliberately, because a required
  check that never reports jams the queue forever. A pull request touching only `notes/` and
  `design/` therefore collects five green required checks that executed nothing. That is correct
  behaviour and it is worth knowing when reading a green tree.
- **`verify (Kani proofs)` is also green when `verify scope` says nothing can reach a proof.** The
  aggregator treats `skipped` as passing on purpose. The proofs' coverage therefore depends on
  `script/verify --affected-since` being right about what a change reaches, and that predicate is
  the whole gate.
- **`script/shell-check` can pass a boot it should have failed**, and says so in its own `BUGS`: the
  kernel's fault printer and the userspace console server drive the same UART with nothing
  arbitrating, so the boot-line checks put their teeth on the sentence init prints when the answer
  is no, and a line destroyed by interleaving is reported rather than failed when the kernel
  demonstrably wrote during the boot.
- **`script/crate-probes` measures compile and link and nothing else**, per its own `BUGS`.
  `tempfile` passes and every one of its operations returns "operation not supported" at run time. A
  green row is not a working crate, and fatal risk 1 rests on this instrument.
- **`script/audits --due` red is the healthy state** when an audit is due. Its last line says so:
  "Red means run the audit. Nothing here ran one, and nothing here can." A reader who treats red as
  breakage will learn to ignore it, which is the failure mode this whole note is about.
- **`script/interleaving-check` models C11, not ARM and not RISC-V.** A bug it finds is real; a
  clean run is not a proof about silicon.

## The five findings

Ranked by what a wrong answer costs.

### 1. The mutation workflow has never produced a result, and fatal risk 3 cites it as though it had

`design/fatal-risks.md`'s third risk (the tests do not test anything, and the quality is illusory)
stands at MEASURED, green, on a run from **2026-08-03**: 92.4% of viable mutants killed. Its closing
line is *"the weekly workflow already publishes the report."*

It has published nothing. Four scheduled runs (2026-08-10, 08-17, 08-24, 08-31), zero successes, at
least one shard red every week. On the most recent run all four shards died together about fourteen
minutes in with `The runner has received a shutdown signal`, which is the shape of the whole run
being reclaimed rather than of a defect in any shard; on the three before it, shard 4 died in about
twenty seconds every time while others ran for half an hour. The `report against the baseline` job
runs `if: always()` and aggregates whatever shards survived, into a step summary nobody has read.

Nobody noticed for four weeks, and the reason is structural rather than careless: a scheduled
workflow's red is an entry in the Actions tab with no badge and no notification, which is exactly
the diagnosis `toolchain-bump.yml`'s own comments already wrote down about `toolchain drift` on
2026-07-31.

### 2. The Miri check has been red for three weeks on a missing environment variable, not on undefined behaviour

`crates/manual/tests/render.rs:279` reads `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` at run time, deliberately, with a
comment explaining that the compile-time form bakes a stale absolute path. Miri does not forward the
environment by default, so `every_character_survives` panics with `cargo sets this for tests:
NotPresent` and the job exits 1. The same test passes under `cargo test`.

So milestone 79's check (Miri over the host crates) has reported failure for three consecutive weeks
for a reason that has nothing to do with undefined behaviour. That is worse than a check nobody
runs: it is a check that cries wolf on a schedule, and the only available response to it is to stop
reading it. The candidate fix is one flag, `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-env-forward=CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, which
Miri's own message suggests; it is not applied here because that is a change to a check rather than
an audit of one.

### 3. `re-falsify the harnesses this change can reach` does not block, and something walked through the hole

`verify.yml`'s `falsify` job carries a comment saying it is **not** a required check deliberately, so
that it can fail loudly without being one more name to keep in sync. On 2026-09-03 PR #663
(milestones 231 and 233) merged with that check **red** while all eleven required checks were green,
and `main` carried two stale falsification patches until a follow-up landed.

The deliberate reasoning is sound about ruleset maintenance and wrong about what the check is. A
falsification record that no longer falsifies is a defect in the commit that caused it, which is the
job's own comment saying so; a defect in the commit is the definition of something that should block
the commit.

### 4. Three instruments run nowhere, and two of them are cheap

- **`script/interleaving-check`** (milestone 80, loom over the hand-rolled atomic protocols) is in no
  workflow and in no gate. It is the only thing in this tree that can falsify a violation of
  AGENTS.md's fourth rule, assume weak memory ordering. Its header says it is out of `script/test`
  and `script/gates` "for the same reason as `script/undefined-behavior-check`", and that analogy is
  broken: the sibling it names has a weekly workflow and this has nothing. **Measured today: 12.4
  seconds wall clock, 30 crates compiled, all 26 harnesses green**, including the falsification
  witness that passes only when loom finds the pre-fix double free.
- **`script/crate-probes`** is the instrument behind fatal risk 1 (only software written for nife
  runs on nife), which is recorded GREEN. Its own `BUGS` explains why it is not a CI gate: it needs
  the network and it takes the account-wide `nife-dev` toolchain link. **Measured today: 43 of 50
  built, 7 failed, in about 3 minutes including the std farm refresh.** The recorded 43/7 split in
  `notes/crates-io-on-nife.md` still holds, and the seven failures are the same seven
  (`zip`, `ring`, `gix-config`, `gix`, `tar`, `diesel`, `rocket`). This is the one place the audit
  found the record already true.
- **`script/rule-violations --check`** exits non-zero when any open rule reaches three strikes.
  Nothing calls it. It is green today at two open strikes across three rules, so nothing has been
  missed yet, but the threshold milestone 118 defined is currently checked by nobody.

`script/repeat-under-load` and `script/soak` are also uncalled and are genuinely instruments rather
than gates: one is milestone 62's acceptance evidence for a flake, the other is milestone 219's
rehearsal of a bench run. Neither wants a cadence; both want a caller when the question they answer
is being asked.

### 5. `image permissions` and `architect hold` are already-recorded open asks

Neither is a discovery. `ci.yml`'s `image-permissions` job carries a `BUGS` paragraph saying it is
not required because that is a repository setting rather than a file in this tree, and that making
it required is calef's and is one checkbox. `architect-hold.yml` describes itself three times as "a
required status check" and its job comment says the name "is what goes into ruleset 19596094's
`required_status_checks` once someone with admin access adds it". Both are waiting on the same
click.

## The recommendation on the required list

Which checks join the list is a repository setting and calef's. Four to add, with what each would
have caught:

| add | what it would have caught | cost of adding |
|---|---|---|
| `re-falsify the harnesses this change can reach` | PR #663 merging with two stale falsification patches, 2026-09-03 | it already runs on every PR and every merge group; making it required adds no minutes |
| `image permissions (no kernel image ships a writable-executable segment)` | the x86_64 image's RWX segment (milestone 208), which shipped through every gate | already runs; no minutes |
| `architect hold (needs-architect label)` | the 2026-08-27 `gh pr merge --auto` on a `needs-architect` pull request | already runs; one API call |
| nothing else | | |

**On `architect hold`, milestone 232's own block says the third is correct as it stands, since a
label gate should not block a queue. The evidence in the tree disagrees and is worth reading before
deciding.** The workflow was built to be required: it listens for `merge_group` for that reason
alone, it listens for `labeled`/`unlabeled` so the result flips without a push, and it holds its
runtime to one API call so it can never be the check that jams a queue. Its founding incident is a
merge that a non-blocking check could not have stopped. The honest cost is real and is the reason to
decide rather than assume: a label added to a pull request already sitting in the merge queue turns
this red mid-group, and an ALLGREEN group of up to five is evicted together. That is a narrow window
and the label is normally applied long before enqueue.

**Do not add** `verify scope`, `prove (shard N/2)`, or `draft gate`. The first two are aggregated by
a check that is already required and that treats a shard's `skipped` correctly; the third is not a
verdict.

## What this says about fatal risk 3, without changing its status

The status is `design/fatal-risks.md`'s question and calef's. Two facts belong in front of him
before he re-reads it.

**The number is older than it looks and cannot currently be refreshed.** 92.4% was measured on
2026-08-03. **2,529 commits** have landed since, and the roadmap has gone from that month's count to 130 milestones marked BUILT. The block says the
remaining experiment is cheap, "re-run it and compare against `.cargo/mutants-baseline.txt`", and
that is still true on a developer machine; it is not true in CI, where the mechanism has failed
every attempt.

**The sentence "the weekly workflow already publishes the report" is false and has been since the
workflow was written.** That is the load-bearing clause: it is what makes a stale number acceptable,
because a refresh is supposed to be arriving on its own. Nothing is arriving.

None of this says the 92.4% was wrong when it was taken. It says the tree has no current measurement
and no working mechanism for taking one, which is a different claim from the risk being red.

## BUGS

- **This is a snapshot with no mechanism behind it.** The four findings that prompted milestone 232
  arrived within one day, which suggests the rate matters more than the count, and nothing here keeps
  the answer current. The cheapest thing that would is a scheduled job reading run history for
  workflows that have not succeeded in N weeks; it is not built here, deliberately, because this
  milestone's own block forbids acquiring a fourth deleted lint.
- **The third question was answered by reading, not by a method.** Six checks are listed above whose
  green means less than their name, and they were found by opening each file and asking. There is no
  reason to believe six is the whole set. Milestone 233's `login` was found by somebody asking what a
  passing check proved, and that remains the only known way to find the next one.
- **The mutation failure is described, not diagnosed.** All four shards dying together on one run and
  shard 4 dying in twenty seconds on three others are two different symptoms, and the step logs for
  the failing step were no longer retrievable through `gh` at the time of writing. Whether it is a
  memory kill, an eviction, or a defect in `script/mutation --shard 4/4` is open.
- **The `result 2026-09-03` column for the required checks is read from `main`'s last run**, not from
  a run of this branch. A check green on `main` this morning is not a promise about tonight.
- **`script/toolchain-bump`'s status is unknown and was not measured.** Running it would raise the
  pin in the working tree, which is not something an audit should do.
