# Notes index: Drivers and devices

Part of [the notes index](../README.md), which says how to add a line.

- [virtio-blk, driven from userspace](../virtio.md): a block device driven from EL0 with DMA.
- [PCIe, and driving a disk over it](../pcie.md): the PCIe transport, with the kernel as firmware.
- [Scoping a PCIe transport](../pcie-transport-scope.md): the pre-build scope for PCIe and virtio-pci.
- [NVMe: the first non-virtio disk](../non-volatile-memory-express.md): an NVMe driver confined by the IOMMU alone.
- [Fatal risk 6's bench evening on xenon](../risk-6-bench-evening.md): the confined NVMe driver's preflight, throughput boot and outcomes.
- [Confining DMA without an IOMMU](../dma.md): kernel validation of every descriptor a driver submits.
- [Confining DMA with an IOMMU](../iommu.md): hardware DMA confinement with SMMUv3 and the RISC-V IOMMU.
- [Block devices: what is attached, and what holding one means](../block-devices.md).
- [A machine with no serial port](../serial-less-output.md): screen output for machines without a UART.
- [The framebuffer contract](../framebuffer-contract.md): how a confined client gets pixels onto a screen.
- [The compositor](../compositor.md): one screen shared among clients that distrust each other.
- [Glyphs, the VT engine, and input](../glyphs.md): the font, VT engine and keyboard behind on-screen text.
