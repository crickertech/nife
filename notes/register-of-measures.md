# The register of measures: every number this kernel owes itself

*(Milestone 134. The name `register-of-measures.md` is **provisional**; naming is calef's, and a
lane ships a provisional one and says so.)*

This tree measures a great deal and remembers almost none of it. A number gets taken once, written
into a note beside the reasoning that needed it, and then sits there being true on the day it was
written. `notes/counted-claims.md` found three such numbers on 2026-08-14 and **all three were
wrong**; every one had been right when somebody typed it.

That convention fixed the class of number a `grep` can re-derive. This register is the other half:
the numbers that need an instrument, a boot, or a walk over the source. It says which ones this
kernel is holding itself to, which ones it merely knows, and which ones it has defined and cannot
yet take.

**And `notes/project-metrics.md` is the half that moves.** This register says which numbers are owed
and what each one is held to; that page plots the ones that change every week, one row per ISO week,
recomputed from git history by `script/metrics` so nothing here has to be remembered. Several
measures below appear there as a series: the `unsafe` density and its ceiling, the Kani harness
count, the markdown corpus. A reader who finds either file should find the other.

## What belongs here, and the test

**A number belongs if something depends on its value and it can move without anybody editing it.**

Both halves are load-bearing and the second is the one that cuts.

- *Something depends on its value.* Not "somebody would find it interesting". A decision rests on
  it, a constant is sized against it, a claim in the documentation quotes it, or a customer notices
  when it moves. `manual::render::LINE_MAX` is 2048 because the longest markdown line was 1841, so
  that measurement has a **consumer**; the kernel's image size, which
  `notes/benchmarks.md` itself calls "the number that does not matter", has only a reader.
- *It moves on its own.* A constant somebody chose is not a measure, it is a decision, and it
  belongs in `DECISIONS.md`. The stack guard page is 4,096 bytes because a page is 4,096 bytes. The
  deepest chain that can reach that guard is a measure, because the compiler moves it every week
  and nobody is asked.

**A register that lists every number in the tree is worthless**, so the exclusions are as much of
this document as the rows are, and each one names the test it failed. They are in their own section
below rather than implied by absence.

## The three states, and the middle one is the finding

Every row is in exactly one of these. The state is a property of the **instrument**, not of the
measure's importance.

| state | means | what happens when the number moves |
|---|---|---|
| **gated** | an instrument re-takes it, and something fails on a bad move | a red build, at the commit that moved it |
| **dated** | a named command re-takes it; nothing fails | the recorded value goes stale, silently |
| **owed** | defined, with its instrument named; no instrument exists yet | nothing, because nothing is measured |

**The `dated` rows are the answer to the question this milestone was raised to ask.** They are the
numbers something depends on where a regression arrives as somebody's data being slow rather than
as a red check. Promoting one to `gated` is the work; recording that it is `dated` is what makes the
work visible.

`dated` is not a defect by itself. `notes/counted-claims.md` puts it plainly: *"A wall clock is not
a count... dating a measurement is the honest alternative to gating it, and the two should not be
confused."* A number that costs a forty-minute boot to re-take does not belong in a gate that runs
on every push. The defect is a `dated` row with no date, or with no command.

## Gated

Nine instruments, and it is worth seeing them in one table because **six of them are the same
shape**: a ceiling that fires when a number grows and stays silent when it falls. Four of those six
were here before milestone 134, unnamed and unconnected, which is why `count-at-most` is a name for
a pattern rather than a new idea. Row 1 is the odd one out, a two-sided drift band, and row 9 is a
floor.

| measure | instrument | what fails |
|---|---|---|
| icount ticks, 14 benchmarks, both ISAs | `script/bench --check` | drift over 10% from `bench/baseline-*.txt` |
| IPC fastpath instruction footprint | `script/fastpath-footprint --check` | growth over 5% from `bench/fastpath-*.txt` |
| the largest kernel stack frame | `script/stack-frame-check` | any frame over the 4,096-byte guard page |
| the deepest reachable kernel-thread chain | `script/stack-depth-check` | a chain over the 24,576-byte stack |
| kernel stack high-water, at runtime | `script/test`, `report_high_water` | boot 61,440, secondary 16,384, thread 18,432 |
| eleven counted claims (harnesses, syscalls, rights bits, ...) | `script/lint` | a marked number disagreeing with the tree |
| unsafe density outside `kernel/src/arch/` | `script/lint` | over 94 blocks per 10,000 lines of code |
| `unsafe impl Send`/`Sync` claims | `script/lint` | over 17, which is today's tree exactly |
| per-file line coverage | `script/coverage` | any file under the 80% floor |

The ceilings are rows 2 through 5 and 7 and 8, and reading their thresholds together is the
useful part, because they are six different kinds of number. 5% is a tolerance. 4,096 is a hardware
fact. 24,576 is a configuration constant. The high-water limits are margins over an observed
maximum. 17 is today's tree exactly. And 94 per 10,000 (lowered from 100, then 97, then 96, then
95, then 94, by milestone 139; round 5 reduced the block count further but left the truncated
density and therefore the ceiling unchanged, see notes/unsafe-obligations.md) is a **claim about
the tree that was false until shortly before it was written**, which makes it the
only one that expresses a direction rather than a limit. That distinction is what `count-at-most`
exists for; see notes/unsafe-obligations.md for the measurement behind it.

Two of these are the register doing its job on itself: the unsafe rows did not exist when milestone
134 opened, and the `unsafe fn` count that would have been a third turned out to be **already
derived** by `script/lint`'s `==> unsafe fn contracts` check. Finding a number already tracked is as
much a result as finding one that is not.

## Dated

The command is the point of each row. A dated measurement whose re-taking is folklore is a `dated`
row pretending to be one.

| measure | last taken | the command that re-takes it |
|---|---|---|
| IPC round trip in nanoseconds, both planes | 2026-08-04 | `script/bench --real` |
| filesystem throughput, milestone 38's four phases | 2026-08-18 | `script/bench --real --smp`, with a RedoxFS disk attached |
| primitives against Linux and macOS on the same host | **no date recorded** | `bench/host/run_linux.sh`, then `script/bench --real` |
| `unsafe {}` blocks inside `kernel/src/arch/` | every run | `script/lint`, which prints it and asserts nothing |
| E1: IPC round trip against thread count | 2026-08-22 | `cargo xtask bench --real` (`ipc_scale_*` rows, aarch64 only) |
| E2: thread census on the customer path | 2026-08-22 | `cargo xtask test`, the "E2 thread census" line in `a_host_process_connects_to_the_guest_and_is_answered` (both ISAs) |
| E3: IPC fastpath footprint doubled, and the latency it costs | 2026-08-22 | `script/fastpath-footprint --features fastpath_pad` (both ISAs); `cargo xtask bench --real --extra-features fastpath_pad` against `cargo xtask bench --real` (aarch64 only) |
| E4: application working-set displacement under IPC traffic, at typical (8-pair) and high (48-pair, E1's-knee) background load | 2026-08-23 | `cargo xtask bench --real` (`appdisp_*_ipc`/`appdisp_*_ipc96` rows, aarch64 only) |

**E1 through E4, taken 2026-08-22 (milestone 134's Tier A lane).** All four ran on the dev Mac
under HVF; none of the four needed silicon, which is what the block promised, but three of them
(E1, E3's latency half, E4) need a *real cache* to say anything, and this tree's only accelerator
with one is HVF, so they self-skip under TCG (both the default icount instrument and every riscv64
run, which has no HVF equivalent) rather than print a number that would be fiction. E3's static
footprint measurement is not in that boat: it is `objdump`-based and runs on both ISAs with no
QEMU at all.

- **E2 (cheapest, taken first, and it is close to decisive).** The naive reading of
  `sched::thread_count()` inside the SMB/FS gate test read 95 (aarch64) and 82 (riscv64), and both
  numbers were wrong for what E2 asks: the full kernel test suite runs 279 `#[test_case]`s in ONE
  continuous boot, so an absolute count taken partway through includes whatever earlier tests left
  allocated. The delta against a baseline taken at the top of the SAME test (before it wires
  anything) is the number that isolates the topology's own cost, and it is **4 new threads on both
  ISAs**: `net_stack`, the echo client, the SMB adapter, the mDNS responder. The FS service (block
  server + FS server) and the credential service add nothing to the delta because they are already
  running, latched from earlier tests in the same boot and reused rather than re-spawned, which is
  itself informative: a from-scratch boot would add roughly three more (a generous estimate is 7 to
  8 total). Either number is deep in single digits, nowhere near E1's knee (below). **§96 is moot
  for this workload as currently shaped**, which is the finding E2 was raised to check for before
  spending on E1 at all.
- **E1.** `ipc_scale_N` (N = threads, 2 to 96, via `tp_batch`/`tp_best` pinned to one hart) is flat
  at roughly 1,270 to 1,310 ns/iter from 2 through 16 threads across three repeated runs, then
  rises, reproducibly, to roughly 1,360 to 1,420 ns/iter (8 to 11%) by 64 to 96 threads. The knee
  starts where the prediction said it would (the low tens) and the magnitude is small because the
  dev Mac's L1d is far larger than the 32 KB `SiFive` U74 the prediction was built against: a
  reproducible cost at 96 threads on a large-cache machine is the "positive result is conclusive"
  case the block's own BUGS names, and it argues for taking this to a small-cache board rather than
  against the mechanism. Read against E2: the customer path (4 to 8 threads) sits inside the flat
  region, well below where any cost appears on this machine.
- **E3.** The static half: padding roughly doubles `ipc_fastpath` on both ISAs (aarch64 5,792 to
  11,628 bytes, 2.01x; riscv64 5,088 to 10,152 bytes, 2.00x), confirming the padding mechanism does
  what it claims before asking whether it costs anything. The latency half, aarch64 only: `ipc_rtt`
  and `ipc_rtt_el0` move by 2 to 3% between the padded and un-padded builds, which is inside the
  run-to-run noise both builds show independently (repeated `--real` runs of the SAME binary vary
  by a similar amount). **No effect, on this machine**, which the block's own BUGS calls the weak
  direction: the dev Mac's L1i comfortably holds 11.2 KiB, so a negative result here proves little
  and wants the same small-cache board E1 does.
- **E4.** With a 5-repeat minimum (the first unrepeated run swung 2 to 3x between nominally
  identical conditions, a real methodological finding in its own right: this workload's batches run
  long enough to catch host preemption the way `smp_throughput`'s shorter ones do not), throughput
  lost to 8 concurrent IPC pairs (16 threads) is 0 to 5% across working sets from 4 to 128 KiB, over
  three repeated runs (widened from the first cut's "0 to 3%" by two more runs on the same shared,
  noisy machine; see this section's own bug about that). **No effect worth calling one, on this
  machine**, and it is not in tension with E1: 16 threads of background traffic sits inside E1's own
  flat region, below where E1 itself found any cost on this hardware.

  **The stronger follow-up this section originally deferred was taken 2026-08-23.** A second
  background-load condition, `SCALE_MAX_PAIRS` (48 pairs, 96 threads, the same pair count E1's own
  sweep tops out at), was added to `app_displacement` alongside the original 8-pair one. Over the
  same three repeated runs: throughput lost at 96 threads reads 2 to 9%, higher than the low-load
  figure at every one of the 5 working sets on every one of the 3 runs, no exception. That is a
  small, reproducible, direction-consistent effect, not a knee: the two ranges (0-5% and 2-9%)
  overlap, and E1's own equivalent point (94-96 threads) only shows an 8-11% cost, so a modest
  displacement number at the same load is the mutually consistent reading rather than a stronger
  independent finding. It wants the same small-cache board E1 and E3's latency half already want,
  because on this machine the two conditions are separated by a few percentage points riding on top
  of run-to-run noise of a similar size.

**The filesystem row is the one on the customer path**, and it is the clearest case in the register
for why `dated` is a finding rather than a filing. Milestone 55 is a Time Machine target the
family's Macs back up to. A three-times regression in sequential write would show up as a backup
that used to finish overnight and now does not, reported by a person rather than by CI, and nothing
in this tree would have said a word. It is `dated` because taking it needs a boot with a disk
attached, which is not a thing to put on every push; the honest promotion is a scheduled run rather
than a gate, and it wants a lane.

**The cross-OS row is the register earning its keep on its first pass.** Its section in
notes/benchmarks.md, "The first cross-OS numbers (nife vs Linux vs macOS)", **carries no date at
all**, and the numbers in it are the ones a stranger is most likely to quote back at us: they are
the comparison against Linux and macOS. A dated measurement with no date is a `gated` row's opposite
and a `dated` row's failure mode at once, and nothing in this tree would have said so. Dating it
means re-taking it, because nobody now knows which run it was; that is a small lane and it is named
in this milestone's handoff.

**The arch row is the odd one and it is deliberate.** There is no ceiling on unsafe inside
`kernel/src/arch/`, because driving that number down means either writing assembly wrong or moving
it out of `arch/`, and rule 1 says arch code belongs there. A target would be a gate pushing against
the architecture. But an unmarked number in a note is exactly the snapshot this whole register is
against, so `script/lint` prints it on every run: on screen every build, asserted never. **A number
with a consumer gets a relation; a number with only a reader gets printed.**

## Owed

Eight measures (M5 through M12, "Tier B") are defined and cannot be taken here: all eight need the
cycle counters of milestone 74, the authority question of milestone 75, or silicon with a real PMU.
E1 through E4 ("Tier A") no longer belong in this section: all four ran 2026-08-22 and are `dated`
rows above.

They are **not duplicated into this table**, because they already have a home that carries each
one's instrument, its prediction, and what its outcome settles:
design/roadmap/134-the-measurements-that-decide.md. Two open kernel decisions were waiting on the
Tier A half of them, and the block's own correction is worth knowing before anyone reaches for
hardware: §95 and §96 both recommend waiting for the TX1, and **both over-gated**, because the
experiments that produce a verdict need no silicon. Tier A's results are summarized above; Tier B
remains genuinely gated on the counters and the board.

## Deliberately not in this register

Each of these was considered and each names the half of the test it failed. The list is here so the
next person does not add them back.

| number | why it is out |
|---|---|
| the kernel's image size (290,816 bytes on aarch64) | **no consumer.** notes/benchmarks.md derives it and then says in its own heading that it is "the number that does not matter": `.text` that never runs during an IPC costs nothing in cache |
| `script/verify`'s wall clock (~47 minutes) | **no consumer.** It is a reader's patience, not a constraint anything is sized against, and notes/verification.md dates it honestly |
| lines of Rust, crates, user programs, commits | **no consumer.** AGENTS.md's method figures are rhetoric about scale, and that file says so; a gate on them would be measuring a paragraph |
| `nifefs`'s `NAME_LEN = 32` | **does not move on its own.** It is a decision with a cost per directory block, not a measurement |
| the number of `#[cfg(kani)]` unsafe blocks (14) | **already gated**, by milestone 113's fourteenth clippy configuration, per block rather than in aggregate |
| `unsafe {}` against `// SAFETY:` parity | **measured and refused.** `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks` already enforces it per block as a hard error, and a count comparison disagrees with it in 65 places (38 after the regex is loosened), every one read a document that is right. notes/unsafe-obligations.md carries the reading |
| the CoreMark score | **already gated**, as a row in `bench/baseline-*.txt` |

The parity row is the one worth reading before proposing a new gate. A count check that fails
correct documents is not a weak gate, it is a gate that will be deleted, and `script/lint` has
already lost three checks with that signature.

## EXAMPLES

### Adding a measure to the register

Take the unsafe census, from calef's question to a gated row, because every step of it went
differently than expected.

**1. Apply the test out loud.** Does anything depend on the amount of unsafe in this tree? Yes: the
whole demonstrator claim is a verified-Rust capability microkernel, and unsafe is where verification
stops. Does it move without anybody editing it? Yes, 42 non-merge commits changed it in fourteen
days. Both halves pass.

**2. Take the number, and take it more than once.** A single measurement cannot tell a direction
from a level, and here it inverted the answer:

```sh
# blocks outside kernel/src/arch/, at four points in the tree's history
2026-07-15   171 blocks in   7,508 lines   227.8 per 10,000
2026-08-04   728 blocks in  58,351 lines   124.8 per 10,000
2026-08-16   817 blocks in  73,129 lines   111.7 per 10,000
2026-08-18   747 blocks in  80,359 lines    93.0 per 10,000
```

The count more than quadrupled and the density more than halved. A ceiling on the count would have
fired on nearly every lane; a ceiling on the density holds a trend that is already going the right
way.

**3. Choose the relation from the shape of the quantity, not from taste.** Equality for a census
somebody maintains, `count-at-least` where more is better and a deletion is the bad event,
`count-at-most` where less is better and a drift up is. See notes/counted-claims.md.

**4. Watch it fail.** This is not optional and it is where the two real bugs were:

```sh
# add one `unsafe impl Send` anywhere, then:
$ script/lint
lint: a counted claim disagrees with the tree:
  notes/unsafe-obligations.md:461: claims at most 17, the tree has 18
  (unsafe-thread-safety-claims: how many `unsafe impl Send`/`Sync` claims the tree makes, each one
  a hand-written assertion that the compiler is wrong about a type). A ceiling is only wrong when it
  stops being true, so this means the count went UP by 1 past the headroom. Take the addition back
  out, or raise the ceiling in this commit and say beside it why the addition was worth it
```

The density ceiling's first marker **did not fire when it should have**, and the reason is the sort
of thing only a deliberate failure finds. It was written as `at most 91 blocks per 10,000 lines`,
and the convention binds a marker to the **last** number on the line, so the gate was comparing
10,000 against 92 and passing every time. The marker now sits immediately after its own number.

### Re-taking a dated measure

There is no wrapper and there should not be one: each dated row's command is in its table cell
because the commands are genuinely different animals, and a `script/measures` that ran all of them
would take an hour and be run by nobody. Copy the cell.

```sh
# the filesystem row, which needs a disk attached
script/bench --real --smp

# then edit the date in this file's table, in the same commit as the numbers
```

If the number moved, **the finding is the movement**, not the new value. Say what moved and against
what, in notes/benchmarks.md where the series lives, and leave this register holding only the date.

## BUGS

- **E1, E3's latency half, and E4 need a real cache, and this tree has one accelerator that
  provides one.** "Tier A needs no silicon" is true of the experiments' *design*, but a Rust
  benchmark still needs somewhere with real caches to run on, and today that is HVF, aarch64-only.
  `cargo xtask bench --riscv` always runs under TCG (no riscv64 accelerator exists in this tree),
  so all three self-skip there rather than print a fiction, the same self-skip shape
  `real_single_hart_or_skip` in `kernel/src/bench.rs` already uses for the icount case. This is not
  the Tier B kind of gap (a counter or an authority question that does not exist yet); it is that
  this specific instrument needs hardware this tree already has, on one architecture. E3's static
  footprint measurement is unaffected: it is `objdump`-based and needs no accelerator on either ISA.
  Milestone 127's board, when it lands, is the natural second data point, not a blocker for a
  first one.

- **E2's naive reading was wrong, and finding that out is itself worth recording.**
  `sched::thread_count()` taken partway through the full test suite (279 `#[test_case]`s in one
  continuous boot) read 95 and 82 on the two ISAs, both dominated by threads earlier, unrelated
  tests left allocated. The fix (a baseline taken at the top of the same test, the census reported
  as a delta) is in `kernel/src/user/tests.rs` and `riscv_virtio_tests.rs`; any future instrumented
  count of "how many threads does X create" taken from inside the shared-boot suite should take the
  same delta rather than trust an absolute `thread_count()` reading.

- **Closed 2026-08-23.** E4's original background load (8 pairs, 16 threads) sat inside E1's own flat
  region, so a null result there was expected from E1's curve rather than independent evidence
  against displacement. `app_displacement` now also runs 48 pairs (96 threads, E1's own top pair
  count) as a second condition; see this file's E4 narrative above for the result, a small
  reproducible cost consistent with rather than stronger than E1's own finding at the same load. Not
  a knee, and the honest reading is that this machine's cache is still too large to see one; that
  wants the small-cache board, not another thread-count sweep here.

- **A `dated` row goes stale silently, which is the whole point and is also the limitation.** This
  register makes the staleness visible to a reader who opens the file; it makes it visible to
  nobody else. Nothing checks that a date is recent, and a check that did would be asserting a
  policy nobody has set. If a row's staleness starts to matter, the fix is to promote it to
  `gated`, not to add a freshness gate.

- **The register is a ratchet, like the convention it extends.** A measure nobody adds is not
  tracked, and "the register is complete" is never a thing anybody can say. It grows as people
  notice numbers, which is the same honest boundary `notes/counted-claims.md` records.

- **`patches/std-nife/overlay/` is outside the unsafe census, and it is our code.** Thirty-seven
  `unsafe {}` blocks in the `std` platform layer are counted by nothing here. Two separate reasons,
  and only the first is a decision: a ceiling asserts a direction, and that code implements `std`'s
  internal interfaces, so it cannot be restructured to hold fewer unsafe blocks without diverging
  further from the crate we track. The second is worse and is not a decision at all: **that code is
  compiled into `std` by the farm and never by a clippy configuration here**, so
  `undocumented_unsafe_blocks` and `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` do not reach it either. Fifteen of its
  blocks have no `SAFETY:` comment in the form the lint wants, and nothing has ever said so. That
  is a coverage hole in the lint policy rather than a gap in this register, and it wants a lane.

- **Unsafe density can be diluted by writing more safe code, and nothing stops that.** The
  denominator is non-blank lines after comments and string literals are stripped, so prose cannot
  move it, but a verbose safe refactor can. The counter-argument is that the effect is small at
  80,000 lines and that the alternative, a raw count, was measured and is worse. Watch the printed
  numerator, which `script/lint` prints beside the ratio for exactly this reason.

- **The unsafe derivation is a text scanner, not a parser.** It blanks comments and literals with a
  regex before matching keywords, which is what keeps fourteen `unsafe {}` written inside doc
  examples out of the count. Block comments are matched non-greedily and Rust's nest; the tree has
  no nested ones, and a nested one could only make the count too high, which fails loud. Same caveat
  as `script/lint`'s `# Safety`, dead-code and `#[path]` checks, which are built the same way.

- **Nothing here measures the verification argument, and nothing can.** Unsafe density says how much
  code is outside the compiler's guarantees; it says nothing about whether the invariants written in
  the `SAFETY:` comments are true. §61 already records that a lint checks a comment exists and never
  that it is right. A register of numbers is not a substitute for reading them.

- **The gated and dated rows are maintained by hand.** Nothing checks that
  `script/fastpath-footprint` still exists or that `script/bench --real --smp` is still the command,
  which makes this document exactly the class of artifact it was written to complain about, one
  level up. The mitigating fact is that `script/lint` already fails when a script in `script/` has
  no entry in notes/scripts.md, so a renamed instrument cannot vanish quietly from the tree, only
  from this table.
