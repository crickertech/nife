# The `IPC_TABLES` lock: what it protects, and how hot each thing is

*The inventory milestone 17 asks for before anyone partitions anything. Method: every
`IPC_TABLES.lock()` site in `kernel/src/sched.rs` (41 functions as of 2026-08-03), classified by call
path. The classification is by reading, not by measurement; the measurement is exactly what
milestone 88's scaling curve exists to add. Filed under the lock's name at the time
(`SCHED`); milestone 98 renamed the type and the static to `IpcTables`/`IPC_TABLES`
(DECISIONS §118), on this note's own finding below that the hot set is IPC rather than
scheduling. This note follows the code, so its own text now says `IPC_TABLES`; this
paragraph is the historical pointer for a reader who remembers the old name.*

The scheduler's per-CPU migration (DECISIONS §28) already moved run queues, `current`, and
held-rank out of shared state. What still lives under the one `IPC_TABLES` lock is the **thread
table** (and with it every thread's CapabilityTable) and the **endpoint array**. Milestone 17's question is
whether that remainder ever costs enough to justify partitioning it; this note is the denominator
for that question.

## By temperature

| Class | Functions | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Hot: every IPC, every core** | `ipc_send`, `ipc_recv`, `ipc_call`, `ipc_reply`, `ipc_send_cap`, `ipc_recv_cap`, `irq_notify` | The `call_reply` fast path this project benchmarks and wins on takes `IPC_TABLES` at least once per operation. At 4 harts the hold times are short enough not to show; whether that survives 64 harts is THE milestone 17 question |
| **Hot: every reschedule** | `schedule` (twice), `depart` | Runs on the core's own queue, but takes the global lock to touch the thread table |
| **Warm: per capability operation** | `grant`, `grant_at`, `current_cap`, `delete_current_cap`, `take_ipc_aborted` | CapabilityTables live inside thread-table entries, so a purely thread-local capability lookup pays for the global lock. If partitioning ever happens, this is the piece that partitions for free (a CapabilityTable has exactly one owner) |
| **Cold: lifecycle** | `create_tcb`, `configure_tcb`, `start_tcb`, `tcb_insert_cap`, `spawn_on`, `spawn_with_quota`, `kill_thread`, `reap_supervised`, `reap_region_objects`, `create_endpoint`, `try_create_endpoint_from`, `adopt_address_space`, `adopt_secondary_idle`, `init` | Dozens per boot, not thousands per second. No plausible contention at any scale this project names |
| **Sweeps: revocation** | `delete_frame_caps`, `delete_device_frame_caps_from_others` | Whole-table scans by design (§13 revokes by physical page). Rare, but they hold the lock for a table-length walk, which is a latency spike every other core eats |
| **Observability, test builds** | `thread_count`, `thread_present`, `dump_threads`, `user_pc_of`, `corpse_fault_msg`, `endpoint_waiting_senders`, `runnable_non_idle_count`, `is_running`, `current_kernel_stack_top` | Test and diagnostic surface. Never a reason to partition, and several are the same functions milestone 78 rescoped tests away from |

## What this says about milestone 17, without a measurement

Three structural observations survive even before the curve exists:

1. **The hot set is IPC.** If the lock ever shows in data, it shows as IPC throughput flattening
   as harts increase while per-op latency holds. That is precisely what `bench --smp`'s
   `smp_throughput` measures, so the instrument mostly exists; what is missing is a machine with
   enough harts for the curve to bend (milestone 88's Graviton stages, up to 64).
2. **CapabilityTable operations are the free win if anything is.** They are logically per-thread already;
   they share the lock only because CapabilityTables are stored in the table. A partition that moved
   nothing else would still take them off the global lock. Any milestone 17 design should price
   this piece separately from the thread table proper.
3. **The revocation sweeps are the awkward customers.** Revoke-by-physical-page wants to visit
   every CapabilityTable, which is exactly the operation partitioning makes expensive (visit every shard,
   or broadcast). A partitioned design pays here to win on IPC; the trade should be measured, not
   assumed, and §13's semantics are not negotiable to make a scheduler faster.

## The sequencing, recorded

Milestone 17 stays OPTIONAL and gated on evidence: **milestone 88 provides the machine** (the
scaling curve at 4/8/16/64 harts is a stated deliverable of its bench stage), and **milestone 80
provides the method** (any design that replaces this lock with messages wants its protocol born
loom-checked; the wake-before-switch-out race is the standing proof that SMP interleavings hide
from this tree's other tools). Until the curve bends, the one lock is the right design, on
purpose.

## BUGS

- The temperature classification is by reading call paths, not by counting acquisitions. A
  test-build acquisition counter on `IPC_TABLES` would turn this table into numbers for one evening of
  work; it was not built here because the interesting contention only exists on hardware this
  project cannot rent until milestone 88's boot path lands.
- `kernel/src/sched.rs` line numbers drift; the inventory is by function name on purpose. Re-grep
  before trusting the count of 41.
