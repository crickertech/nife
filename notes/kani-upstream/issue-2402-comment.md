I've opened a pull request that covers part of this: an unstable `--target <TRIPLE>` for `kani` and `cargo kani`, `cargo build-dev --lib-target <TRIPLE>` so one Kani build can hold libraries for several targets, and a `riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu` machine model. It only handles 64-bit little-endian targets. The 16-bit `usize` case from the original report, and the big-endian case @jswrenn described, would each still need their own machine-model work (and `goto-cc -m32` for 32-bit, per #2086).

Our use is proving a kernel's riscv64 code from x86_64 and Apple Silicon machines. A goto program's machine model is just data, so no riscv64 host is needed. Feedback on the shape is very welcome, including whether you'd rather see an RFC first.
