# The user address-space map

Every process on nife has the same low half, and several programs agree on where things go in it:
the linker script, two loaders, std's runtime, the kernel's test harnesses and every fixture that
shares a page. Until 2026-09-26 nobody had written down which addresses meant what, so each new page
was placed by looking for a gap. Two things came of that. A program image had under 896 KiB before
it ran into its own stack, and a page the kernel maps into every process was first placed on top of
a fixture's window. Milestone 206 (a program image has under 896 KiB) drew the map (DECISIONS §171 (where a program image starts), option D, ruled by calef that day).
The map is a crate, [`crates/address_space_map`](../crates/address_space_map/src/lib.rs), because
it is a list of numbers several binaries agree on (AGENTS.md rule 7). This page explains it; the
crate is the rule.

## The map

| band | start | end | size | what goes in it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NULL_GUARD` | `0x0000_0000` | `0x0020_0000` | 2 MiB | nothing, ever |
| `PAIR_PAGES` | `0x0020_0000` | `0x1000_0000` | 254 MiB | pages one builder agrees with the one program it builds, and a program's private windows |
| `RUNTIME_WINDOWS` | `0x1000_0000` | `0x4000_0000` | 768 MiB | windows a loader or runtime places for a program: std's runtime pages, std's socket frames, a builder's scratch cursor, the initrd window, the swap image |
| `HEAP` | `0x4000_0000` | `0x5000_0000` | 256 MiB | the heap and nothing else |
| `SERVICE_WINDOWS` | `0x5000_0000` | `0x6000_0000` | 256 MiB | large windows a service contract names: the block channel, the C seam's grant pages, the screen aperture |
| `IMAGE` | `0x6000_0000` | `0x7F00_0000` | 496 MiB | the program's code and data |
| `STACK` | `0x7F00_0000` | `0x7FFF_0000` | 16 MiB less 64 KiB | the stack, growing down; its lowest page is never mapped |
| `PROCESS_PAGES` | `0x7FFF_0000` | `0x8000_0000` | 64 KiB | pages the kernel maps into every process unasked; the current-CPU page is the last |

The bands tile the first 2 GiB with no gap. Above that the only resident is the timebase page on
`x86_64` and `riscv64` (`counter_frequency_protocol::PAGE_VA`), which predates the map.

**A program image may now be 496 MiB. It was 896 KiB.** `ripgrep`, measured at 2.61 MiB by milestone
121, fits with room for a hundred and ninety of it.

## Where a new page goes

Ask in order, and stop at the first yes. The crate's docs carry the same list.

1. Is it the program's code or data? `IMAGE`. A child built by hand from a stub puts its code page
   at `IMAGE_BASE` too.
2. Is it the stack? `STACK`, down from `STACK_TOP_PAGE`.
3. Does the kernel map it into every process without being asked? `PROCESS_PAGES`.
4. Is it the heap? `HEAP`.
5. Is it placed by a loader or a runtime for programs that did not choose the address? `RUNTIME_WINDOWS`,
   with a written siting argument in the protocol crate that owns it.
6. Is it a large window a service contract names for several programs? `SERVICE_WINDOWS`.
7. Otherwise it is a pair page: `PAIR_PAGES`. Two pairs never share an address space, so pairs reuse
   addresses freely.

Then write it with the band's function, so the compiler checks it:

```rust
const CTL_VA: u64 = address_space_map::pair_page(0x60_0000);
```

`pair_page`, `runtime_window` and `service_window` return their argument unchanged and stop the build
if it is outside the band or not page aligned. Every fixed window in `fixtures/`, `components/`, the
kernel's harnesses and the progenitor was brought under one of the three when the map landed, 188 of
them.

## Why these numbers

- **2 GiB is a hard ceiling for the image on `x86_64`.** The target builds with `code-model: small`
  and the static relocation model, which promise LLVM that every symbol fits a sign-extended 32-bit
  immediate. `riscv64` and `aarch64` would accept a higher image; one layout for three architectures
  is the parity rule.
- **The heap and the block channel did not move.** Both were already sited, and the heap's numbers are
  generated into std's PAL. The image band starts at the first address above them.
- **The stack sits directly above the image**, so the one limit on an image is the stack's base, and
  a refusal can say exactly that (below). The guard page at the bottom of `STACK` means a stack at its
  limit faults before it touches a full image.
- **16 MiB of stack band** is twice Linux's default main-thread stack. The deepest stack in the tree is
  std's 32 pages. Address space that nothing maps costs nothing.
- The process pages share the stack's last-level table. `notes/benchmarks/spawn-el0.md` measured
  the current-CPU page at 1,245 ticks per spawn in a table of its own and 741 sharing two levels.
  Beside the stack it shares all three and costs only its leaf.

### What it costs in page tables

Counted, not measured. A program with no pair pages (the supervision tree's children, the
benchmark's stub) needs as many tables as before. They are the root, one upper level, one table for
the second gigabyte, one leaf table for the image, and one for the stack and the current-CPU page.
Before, the image and stack shared a leaf table in the first gigabyte and the current-CPU page had its
own. A program with pair pages pays one more table than it did, because it now touches both
gigabytes. A std program pays one fewer, because its heap was already in the second gigabyte.

## A too-large image says so

`kernel::user::load` checks the image against the band before it maps anything, with
`address_space_map::check_image`, and refuses with `LoadError::Misplaced`. The boot prints it as a
sentence:

```
refused to load a user program: the program image is too large: it ends at 0x7f001000, past the
stack's base at 0x7f000000; an image may be at most 496 MiB
```

It used to be `Unmappable(AlreadyMapped)`, from whichever stack page the image happened to reach
first. An image linked for the old layout at `0x40_0000` is refused as outside the band, naming the
base to relink at. `supervision_protocol`'s loader makes the same check, but it reports every failure
as `Err(())`, so there the check only makes the failure early and clean.

## What changed with it

- `kernel::user::USER_STACK_VA` and `supervision_protocol::CHILD_STACK_VA` are both the map's
  `STACK_TOP_PAGE`. Moving the first alone once broke `authority_tests` at stage 10, because the
  second did not move with it; neither can move alone now.
- `crates/user_mode_runtime/link.ld` links at `0x6000_0000`. A linker script cannot name a Rust
  constant, so the map's host test parses the script's `. =` line and fails if the two differ.
- `helpers/build-ripgrep.sh` and `cryptography_exerciser/build.rs` no longer relink at 16 MiB.
- The screen aperture moved from `0x4000_0000`, the heap band's first page, to `0x5800_0000`.
- Hand-built children in the kernel's tests and in `fixtures/` put their code at `IMAGE_BASE` and
  their stack at `STACK_TOP_PAGE`, so their page tables have a real program's shape.
- `cargo xtask` checks every program it packs into an archive against the image band. The first
  CI run found `mkfs` linked outside the shared script, at lld's default `0x20_0000`.
- The progenitor's job regions grew by the one table counted above: 41 pages, and 98 for a job
  that also builds a directory caretaker.

## BUGS

- Membership, not collision. The band functions check that a page is in its band. They cannot see
  two pair pages one program maps landing on each other.
- Two protocol crates restate their numbers. `std_runtime_protocol` and `counter_frequency_protocol`
  are generated into std's PAL, where no crate can be named, so each pins itself to the map with a
  host test instead of deriving from it.
- The timebase page still sits far above the map, paying three tables of its own in every `x86_64`
  and `riscv64` process. It belongs in `PROCESS_PAGES`; moving it is a std farm rebuild and a
  benchmark re-baseline, proposed in milestone 206's block as a follow-up.
- The builder's scratch cursor has no bound. `supervision_protocol` advances one page per page it
  builds and never unmaps. The progenitor's cursor starts at `0x1000_0000` and its initrd window is
  at `0x2000_0000`. After 256 MiB of built pages, about a hundred spawns of a program `ripgrep`'s
  size, the cursor reaches the archive's window and every later build fails as already mapped.
