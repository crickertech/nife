# Overflow checks: what we build, what they find, what they cost

*Provisional name. Milestone 744 (provisional), a measurement asked for by calef on 2026-10-04
(UTC). It changed no profile. calef chose option A on 2026-10-04, and milestone 749 (provisional)
landed it; see "The ruling, and what landed".*

Rust integer arithmetic panics on overflow or wraps silently depending on `-C overflow-checks`,
which Cargo turns on in `dev` and off in `release`. Neither is undefined behaviour (RFC 560), but an
unmeant wrap is a quiet wrong answer.

## What we built before the ruling

Measured on `main` at `1a145fcaa`. No `[profile.dev]` or `[profile.release]` table exists in the
root `Cargo.toml` (only per-package `opt-level` overrides), `.cargo/config.toml` passes no
`-C overflow-checks`, and nothing in `script/`, `xtask/` or `.github/workflows/` sets `RUSTFLAGS` or
`CARGO_PROFILE_*` to change it. So every build gets Cargo's default for its profile, and the profile
is what decides.

| Build | Command | Profile | Overflow checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kernel and workspace programs, kernel tests, three ISAs | `script/test` (`xtask test`) | dev | on |
| Interactive shell gate, three ISAs | `script/swish-check`, `script/boot-check` | dev | on |
| icount tripwire and bench, three ISAs | `script/icount`, `script/bench --check` | dev | on |
| Host tests, coverage | `cargo test --workspace` | dev (test) | on |
| Kani proofs | `script/verify` | Kani's own | checked by the prover (Kani treats overflow as a failed property) |
| Fuzz targets | `script/fuzz` | release, overridden | on (`fuzz/Cargo.toml`, the one explicit setting) |
| Fast-path footprint gate | `script/fastpath-footprint` | release | off |
| Bench for cross-OS magnitudes | `script/bench --release` (HVF, never in CI) | release | off |
| `swish-check --release` (not in CI) | | release | off |
| What a customer installs | `xtask stick` (always release, calef 2026-10-03), the UEFI loader built around it | release | off |
| `redoxfs_server`, `mkfs` (in every image, in the test boots too) | `redoxfs_server_build`, always `--release` | release (own workspace) | off, even under `script/test` |
| `std_exerciser` and its `std` (in every image, test boots too) | `xtask std-exerciser`, always `--release` | release (own workspace) | off, even under `script/test` |
| `cryptography_exerciser`, `rg` (packed only when a helper ran; not in CI) | `helpers/build-*.sh`, `--release` | release | off |

Three facts fall out of that table.

1. **The premise that checks are off almost everywhere is false.** Every gate that runs the kernel
   runs it with checks on, on all three ISAs, because every gate builds `dev`. The kernel's test
   suite has always been an overflow-checked run.
2. **What ships is the opposite build.** The stick is release, so the kernel a customer boots wraps
   silently where every test of it would have panicked.
3. **Three image programs are never checked anywhere.** The filesystem server and the `std`
   programs build release unconditionally, so even the test boots run them unchecked. The
   filesystem server parses an on-disk format, which is the bug class this flag exists for.

### What an overflow panic does

- Kernel, `kernel/src/panic.rs`: prints `[PANIC] <message and file:line>`, warns if the stack
  canary was smashed, then `arch::halt()` (`wfi` forever). Under `cfg(test)` or
  `feature = "system_tests"` it exits QEMU with a failure status instead. One overflow anywhere in
  the kernel stops the machine, so a checked overflow is a denial of service by construction and a
  wrapped one is whatever the wrong number does next.
- A `no_std` program: `user_mode_runtime::panic_handler!`, from
  milestone 130 (one trap instruction, forty-eight sites), calls `trap()`, a `brk`, `ebreak` or
  `ud2` the kernel turns into a faulting death. No message; the program's supervisor sees a fault.
- A `std` program: `panic = "abort"`, so std's panic hook runs and then `rt::abort()` (the
  nife std port, `patches/std-nife/.../pal/nife/mod.rs`). That std's default hook prints the
  message to stderr before aborting is from memory, not checked here.

## Would it find anything

**History says yes, and it already has, four times.** Every one of these was a real bug that the
dev-profile check (or Kani, which checks the same thing) turned into a loud failure:

| Where | Found by | What release would have done | Record |
|---|---|---|---|
| `argon2` `Params::new`, `p_cost * 8` | host test, dev | wrapped; a later bound check happened to save it | notes/credentials.md |
| compositor `Rect::right`, `x + w` from a client page | host test, dev | wrapped into a wrong clip | notes/compositor-claim-25.md |
| `dtb::Region::end`, `start + size` from the blob | fuzzer (checks on) | handed the frame allocator a quietly wrong memory map | notes/fuzzing.md |
| ACPI DMAR `body[0] + 1` in a `u8` | Kani proof | wrong IOMMU address width | notes/falsification.md |

The `dtb` case is the one to remember: notes/fuzzing.md says in so many words that in release the
wrap "is worse" than the panic.

This run. The dev gates are already checked and `main` is green, so the only code this experiment
newly checks is the three release-only image programs and their `std`. The throwaway branch
`lane/overflow-checks-on` (deleted) set `[profile.release] overflow-checks = true` in the root and
the three standalone workspaces, and ran the full CI gate twice:

| Run | Job | Result | What it was |
|---|---|---|---|
| 37167649858 | `test` | failed | Not an overflow. aarch64's frame ledger kept 26,670 frames against a budget of 26,668; every `std` and `redoxfs_server` test had passed. The job stops at the first leg, so riscv64 and x86_64 never ran. |
| 37167649858, 37167651310 | `clippy` | failed | Not an overflow. The throwaway `Cargo.toml` comment cited this milestone before its block existed, and `script/roadmap` refused it. The experiment's own mistake. |
| 37167649858, 37168626690 | `fastpath-footprint` | failed | Expected: the cost below. |
| 37168626690 (budget +64, throwaway) | everything else | passed | The full kernel suite on all three ISAs, `swish-check` on all three, `boot-check`, host tests, fuzz, coverage. |

**No overflow panicked anywhere.** The filesystem server, `mkfs`, `std_exerciser` and the `std`
under them ran their whole test coverage on three ISAs with checks on and none fired.

One side effect: the deterministic frame ledger read 26,670 on aarch64 and 26,645 on riscv64 with
the checked (larger) programs, two over a budget with a 32-frame margin. Adopting checks for them
means re-deriving `SUITE_PAGE_FRAME_BUDGET` in the same change.

## What it costs

All on the same commit (`1a145fcaa`), checks off against checks on, nothing else changed.

### Release kernel: size and the fast path

`script/fastpath-footprint`, run on patagonia, the stock gate against
`CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_OVERFLOW_CHECKS=true`. Bytes of instructions an IPC round trip can touch:

| ISA | `ipc_call_reply` off | on | growth | `syscall_entry` off | on | growth |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| aarch64 | 7,044 | 7,332 | +4.1% | 1,612 | 1,724 | +6.9% |
| riscv64 | 6,106 | 6,632 | +8.6% | 1,976 | 2,244 | +13.6% |
| x86_64 | 8,227 | 8,927 | +8.5% | 1,797 | 1,797 | 0 |

**The gate fails on all three ISAs with checks on** (its 5% drift bound; CI's footprint job on the
experiment branch failed the same way). Every ISA stays inside its 16 KiB ceiling and none crosses
an L1i line it did not already cross: the worst, x86_64's round trip, goes from 25.1% to 27.2% of
radon's 32 KB L1i. riscv64 pays most because it has no flags register, so each check is a compare
and branch rather than a branch on a flag the add already set.

Whole release kernel, sum of function symbol sizes (`llvm-nm -S`), and the number of call sites to
`core::panicking::panic_const_*_overflow`:

| ISA | code off | code on | growth | overflow sites |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| aarch64 | 264,688 B | 268,936 B | +1.6% | 584 |
| riscv64 | 230,896 B | 251,190 B | +8.8% | 1,020 |
| x86_64 | 270,606 B | 299,673 B | +10.7% | 703 |

`.rodata` grows 8 to 12 KiB on each (one `Location` per site). These are upper bounds on what the
kernel would carry, not what a path executes.

### Userspace in the image

The 104 `components` and `fixtures` programs, built release for each ISA, sum of `.text`:

| ISA | off | on | growth |
|---|---|---|---|
| aarch64 | 1,101,408 B | 1,136,356 B | +3.2% |
| riscv64 | 901,524 B | 951,918 B | +5.6% |
| x86_64 | 1,142,886 B | 1,173,941 B | +2.7% |

The three standalone programs were not size-measured; they need the `nife-dev` toolchain link,
which this lane did not take.

### Instructions on the hot paths (the icount tripwire)

The icount bench cannot run a release kernel: `xtask bench` refuses, because release changes
counts, so it is HVF-only and never gates. The instruction cost was therefore measured the other
way round: throwaway
branch `lane/overflow-checks-off` sets `[profile.dev] overflow-checks = false`, and CI's `bench` job
reports each headline against the committed baselines, which are checks-on dev builds.

CI runs 37167649858 (checks on, the stock dev build) and 37167651310 (checks off), same commit,
ticks per iteration from `script/bench --check` on each ISA. A positive cost is what checks add:

| Benchmark | aarch64 | riscv64 | x86_64 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `null_syscall` | 0.0% | 0.0% | |
| `yield_switch` | +0.4% | +1.1% | +0.4% |
| `ctx_switch` | +0.3% | +1.0% | |
| `ipc_rtt` | +0.3% | 0.0% | -2.6% |
| `call_reply` | +0.4% | 0.0% | +0.4% |
| `relay_rtt` | +0.3% | +0.3% | +0.5% |
| `broker_rtt` | +0.3% | +0.6% | +0.4% |
| `ipc_rtt_el0` | -0.9% | +0.8% | |
| `map_new` | +4.0% | +2.6% | +5.8% |
| `map_el0` | +1.2% | +1.6% | |
| `spawn_reap` | +3.8% | +2.6% | +4.4% |
| `spawn_el0` | +2.4% | +1.6% | |
| `coremark` | +5.6% | +5.5% | +7.2% |

Blank cells are benchmarks that ISA does not run. **The IPC and switch paths cost under 1.1%.** The
paths that do arithmetic on addresses and sizes (`map_*`, `spawn_*`) cost 2 to 6%, and CoreMark, a
userspace integer workload, 5.5 to 7.2%. All of it is inside the bench's 10% tripwire, which is
why the checks-off run passed. riscv64's ticks are coarse (`null_syscall` is 3), so a 0% there means
under one tick. Two rows went down with checks on (aarch64 `ipc_rtt_el0`, x86_64 `ipc_rtt`), which
added instructions alone cannot explain; tick quantisation and code layout can, and they set the
noise floor of this table at about 3%. The checks-off branch turns checks off for the kernel and
the workspace programs together, so an `_el0` row carries both.

Not apples-to-apples: these are opt-level 0 kernels, where every check survives. An optimiser
removes checks it can prove redundant, so the release instruction cost is at most this.

### Cycles on the release build (HVF, patagonia)

`script/bench --release` under HVF, seven runs each interleaved, at `1a145fcaa`: no IPC, switch or
syscall cost above run-to-run noise, CoreMark +2.5% with disjoint ranges, and `ipc_rtt_el0`'s median
+5.5% with overlapping ranges. The fourteen-run repeat under "The ruling, and what landed" replaces
this table; the per-run numbers are in git.

## Prior art

Read from source on 2026-10-04 (UTC) unless marked.

- Rust. The reference: integer operators "will panic when they overflow when compiled in debug
  mode"; Cargo's `dev` profile has `overflow-checks = true`, `release` has `false`. RFC 560 makes
  overflow "a program error (but not undefined behavior)" and lets an implementation check "at any
  time", justifying the release default by "final code will not pay a performance penalty".
- Linux, C. The top-level Makefile builds with `-fno-strict-overflow`, so signed overflow in a
  shipped kernel is defined wrapping. `UBSAN_SIGNED_WRAP` is gone; its successor
  `UBSAN_INTEGER_WRAP` `depends on BROKEN`, "very experimental", and limited to `size_t`. LWN
  (2024-01-26) records that wraparound checking was dropped in 5.12 for false positives and that
  Kees Cook's series adds `add_would_overflow()`/`add_wrap()` and `__signed_wrap` annotations to say
  which wraps are meant; Torvalds objected to the cost in generated code.
- Rust-for-Linux. `CONFIG_RUST_OVERFLOW_CHECKS`, `default y`: "a Rust panic will occur on
  overflow. Note that this will apply to all Rust code, including `core`. If unsure, say Y." That
  the panic ends in `BUG()` is from memory.
- Hubris (Oxide): `-C overflow-checks=y` in every firmware build, because "correctness is
  important, and panicking on integer overflow is better than wrapping and being wrong."
- Android: "Overflow checking is on by default in Android for Rust." Chromium turned it on in
  2022 because "in (simplistic) testing they have negligible performance overhead"; where that flag
  lives today was not found, so its current state is unverified.
- Redox, Tock, Theseus: release profiles do not set it, so off.
- seL4 proves "no arithmetic overflows" in its C; how the proof models word arithmetic was not
  on the page read and is from memory.
- Measured costs elsewhere: Dan Luu measured 28% on bzip2 with C overflow checks, mostly lost
  optimisation rather than branches. No published number for Rust-for-Linux or Hubris was found.

Hubris, Rust-for-Linux and Android's Rust ship with checks on. The kernels that ship them off do not
say why.

## Options, and the ruling

Four were put to calef: A, checks on in every release profile; B, checks only in test and CI,
extended to the three release-only programs; C, A plus fast paths written with explicit
`wrapping_*`/`checked_*`; D, unchanged. The recommendation was A with B's programs and C to follow.
The tested and shipped builds disagreed about what `a + b` means, and every overflow found here was
found by a build that panicked. Not an effort argument: D was the least work.

**calef, 2026-10-04 (UTC): "Yes. Launch a lane for the fast paths."** That is A, B's programs and C
in one change, which is how it had to land: the profile flip alone fails the footprint gate.

## The ruling, and what landed

Milestone 749 (provisional). `overflow-checks = true` in the root `[profile.release]` (kernel,
`uefi_loader`, `stick_maker`, each workspace program) and `std_exerciser`, `redoxfs_server` and
`cryptography_exerciser`, whose profiles also build their `std`. `helpers/build-ripgrep.sh` sets it
by environment, and the probe scripts write it into their manifests. `fuzz/` had it already; `tools/redoxfs_host` builds `dev`.

### The fast paths

Every check that landed in a symbol the footprint gate measures was rewritten, and each says why at
its site, in one of four kinds:

- *Wraps that cannot happen*, by an invariant or a proof: the intrusive FIFO's length (the pop side
  under its Kani proof), the capability table's count (`the_count_is_the_slots`), `cpu::id`'s
  subtraction, the current-CPU page offset, riscv64's two `sepc` steps.
- *A stronger check for a weaker one*: `interrupt_stack::guard` indexes the array, so an id of
  `MAX_CPUS` is refused where the multiply let it through.
- *A check moved to where the value enters*: the PLIC claim register's reach, once in `plic::init`.
- *No arithmetic*: the current-CPU page's direct-map address is computed once, at attach.

`rendezvous_of`'s `phys_to_virt` keeps its check; the band did not need it. Bytes from
`script/fastpath-footprint` on patagonia (checks off on `main`, checks on before the rewrite, after):

| ISA | `ipc_call_reply` | `ipc_send_receive` | `syscall_entry` |
|---|---|---|---|
| aarch64 | 7,044 / 7,332 / 6,912 | 5,692 / 5,956 / 5,612 | 1,612 / 1,724 / 1,640 |
| riscv64 | 6,106 / 6,632 / 6,094 | 4,988 / 5,470 / 5,002 | 1,976 / 2,244 / 2,008 |
| x86_64 | 8,227 / 8,927 / 8,467 | 6,588 / 7,244 / 6,832 | 1,797 / 1,797 / 1,797 |

All inside the 5% band, baselines unchanged; the closest is x86_64's `ipc_send_receive`, +4.4%.

### Frame budget, instructions, cycles

The frame budget, re-derived the usual way: CI read 26,673 on aarch64 with checks on (run
37179021009) against 26,667 on `main`, so `SUITE_PAGE_FRAME_BUDGET` is 26,705.

Instructions (CI's icount bench against a `main` run one merge behind the base): no headline moved
more than 1.8% either way. The dev kernel already carried the checks, and the rewrite removed some.

Cycles (`script/bench --release`, HVF on patagonia, 2026-10-04, fourteen interleaved runs each,
median ns and range, on a busier machine than the first measurement's):

| Benchmark | off | on | median change |
|---|---|---|---|
| `null_syscall` | 30 [29-32] | 30 [29-38] | 0 |
| `ipc_rtt` | 51 [49-146] | 50.5 [49-151] | noise |
| `call_reply` | 71 [68-173] | 70 [68-201] | noise |
| `ipc_rtt_el0` | 437.5 [403-583] | 441 [400-811] | +0.8%, noise |
| `ctx_switch` | 131 [127-154] | 133 [127-334] | noise |
| `map_new` | 526 [483-1244] | 506 [478-766] | noise |
| `spawn_reap` | 2033 [1913-3324] | 2221.5 [1875-10496] | noise |
| `coremark` | 9427 [9209-15513] | 9655 [9285-10245] | **+2.4%**, both halves |

**`ipc_rtt_el0`'s +5.5% was not real.** Fourteen runs put the medians 0.8% apart, and twelve of the
"on" readings fall inside the "off" range. CoreMark's +2.4% reproduced in each batch of seven and
matches the first measurement: that is the price, in userspace integer code.

### What it found

No overflow panicked, in CI's suite on three ISAs or in `cryptography_exerciser` and unmodified `rg`,
run by hand on all three with checks on (2026-10-04). x86_64's OVMF leg skips `rg` for want of a
RedoxFS disk; its PVH leg ran it.

## BUGS

- The HVF cycle numbers are aarch64 on one machine (patagonia); riscv64 and x86_64, where the
  checks cost more bytes, have no release cycle measurement.
- The icount figures are opt-level 0 and overstate the release instruction cost.
- `cryptography_exerciser` and `rg` are built only by hand-run helpers, so CI never runs them with
  checks on; the 2026-10-04 run above is by hand and will not repeat itself.
- `rendezvous_of` and the rest of riscv64's and x86_64's `phys_to_virt` callers still carry an add
  check that on x86_64 refuses only addresses past about 119 TiB, beyond the 64 TiB the direct map
  has room for. The check that matters there is a range check, and nothing makes it.
