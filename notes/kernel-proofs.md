# Proving things about `kernel/src`

Milestone 193. The companion to [verification.md](verification.md), which is about proving the pure
crates; this one is about the 64,818 lines the prover could not see until 2026-08-30, and about the
stubs you take on when you point it at them.

*Name provisional: notes are an interface and their names are calef's call (AGENTS.md). `kernel-proofs`
says what the file is about and matches `verification.md`'s neighbourhood; expect it to change.*

## Why this note exists at all

Milestone 191 asked whether any Kani harness in this tree had ever caught a defect after the day it
was written. None had. The cause was not the harnesses and not the technique: it was one line in
`script/verify`'s own header, which has always been honest about it.

> `cargo kani -p <crate>` never compiles the kernel, the user programs, or xtask.

So every proof in the tree was aimed at pure logic, and every concurrency, hardware-contract and
resource-accounting defect the corpus recorded lived somewhere else. DECISIONS §14 promises a
verified core and the core was the part not being verified.

The distance turned out to be four changes.

## What it took, exactly

`cargo check -p kernel --target aarch64-apple-darwin` failed with three errors before this
milestone, and `cargo kani -p kernel` with two more once those were gone. All five, and the fix for
each:

| what stopped it | why | the fix |
|---|---|---|
| `unwinding panics are not supported without std` | the workspace deliberately does not set `panic = "abort"` (DECISIONS §7) | nothing: Kani passes `-C panic=abort` itself, so this is a `cargo check` problem and not a `cargo kani` one |
| `invalid Mach-O section specifier`, twice | `#[unsafe(link_section = ".interrupt_stacks")]` and `".secondary_stacks"` are ELF section names, and the dev machine's host target is Mach-O | `#[cfg_attr(target_os = "none", ...)]`, because the linker script that gives those sections meaning exists only for the bare-metal build |
| `found duplicate lang item panic_impl` | Kani links `std` into the crate it proves, and `std` already defines the panic handler | `#[cfg(not(kani))]` on `kernel/src/panic.rs`'s handler |
| `Crate kernel contains global ASM, which is not supported by Kani` | eleven `global_asm!` blocks: the boot entry, the vector table and the context switch, on all three architectures | `-Z unstable-options --ignore-global-asm`, in `script/verify`'s `kernel` case |

That is the whole list. **DECISIONS §4 rule 1 is why it is this short**: architecture-specific code
lives under `kernel/src/arch/`, so `asm!` appears outside it at only three sites in two files
(`cpu.rs` once, `user.rs` twice) and the other ~50,000 lines are ordinary Rust that a host compiler
was always going to accept. A tree that had let `asm!` spread would not have had a front door here at
all.

## The stub boundary, enumerated

**A proof with an unexamined stub is worse than no proof, because it reads as coverage.** So this is
the exhaustive list of what a harness in `kernel/src` cannot see, and it is short enough to keep
exhaustive. The same list is in `syscall.rs`'s `mod proofs`, where somebody writing the next harness
will actually meet it.

1. **Global assembly is skipped.** Boot entry, vectors, context switch, three architectures. Nothing
   in a harness reaches it, and nothing could.
2. **`asm!` is an unsupported construct.** Every `asm!` site in `kernel/src/arch/`, plus the three
   above. This is a *hard* boundary: if a
   harness ever calls into that code, Kani reports the unsupported construct instead of proving
   past it.

   **This was written as "all of `kernel/src/arch/`" and that was too strong** (milestone 255,
   2026-09-04). The boundary is `asm!` and MMIO, not the directory: 4,004 of `arch/`'s 16,225 lines
   are in files containing no `asm!` at all, and `arch/aarch64/iommu.rs` is now proved in place. The
   architecture layer is still overwhelmingly unverified, and the timer re-arm drift is still on the
   far side of this line, but "unreachable by construction" was a claim about a directory and the
   truth is a claim about two constructs. (This paragraph named the VisionFive 2 undelivered wake
   until 2026-09-24; BUGS below records why that reading is retracted.)
3. **Two thirds of `kernel/src/arch/` is not compiled at all, and this is a `cfg` rather than a
   construct** (milestone 304, 2026-09-16). `arch/mod.rs` selects its subtree with
   `#[cfg(target_arch = ...)]` and Kani compiles for the **host**, so a run sees exactly one
   architecture's `arch/` and no line of the other two. Unlike items 1 and 2 it is **silent**: an `asm!` site makes Kani
   report an unsupported construct, and a `cfg`-excluded file produces no diagnostic of any kind.
   `script/verify` now proves the `kernel` row on two hosts for this reason; see the table below
   for which architecture each one reaches and for the one that nothing reaches.
4. **The panic handler is absent.** Nothing proved here says anything about what the kernel does
   after a panic.
5. **The link sections are absent.** Under `cfg(kani)` the host target is not `target_os = "none"`,
   so `STACKS` and `SECONDARY_STACKS` are ordinary statics rather than statics in their own regions.
   A harness reasoning about guard-page layout would therefore be reasoning about a fiction. Do not
   write one; the region-size claim is held by
   `the_secondary_stack_region_is_the_size_the_linker_reserved` in a real build instead.
6. **MMIO and fixed physical addresses** are raw pointers to nothing under a model checker. The same
   argument applies: stub the boundary, do not pretend.

   **Measured 2026-09-20, and it is louder than this wording suggests** (the `maintainer/verus-versus-kani`
   lane, `notes/verus.md`). A harness doing `read_volatile` on `0x0800_0000`, QEMU `virt`'s GICv2
   distributor, does not quietly reason about a fiction: CBMC has no object at that address and
   reports `dereference failure: pointer NULL`, `pointer outside object bounds` and
   `invalid integer address`. So this is a hard boundary like item 2 rather than a soft one, which is
   the good direction. Stub it anyway; the point of the item stands.
7. **`script/lint`'s harness-clippy pass excludes `kernel`**, so clippy lints do not fire inside
   these harnesses. That pass's own comment carries the two tooling reasons and what still covers
   them. Practical consequence: **keep kernel harnesses free of `unsafe`.**

## What is proved today

Two properties, both in `kernel/src/syscall.rs`, both about `run_end_va` and the map loops that
guard on it. This is the code milestone 193's block predicted would never become a crate, and it is
right: syscall dispatch is a boundary, not a library.

`run_end_va` computes the last virtual address a `count`-page run starting at `va` covers.

- **`the_run_end_is_exact_and_refuses_exactly_what_does_not_fit`.** For every `va` and every
  `count >= 1`: a `Some(last)` is exactly `va + (count - 1) * PAGE_SIZE` computed without wrapping,
  and a `None` is exactly a run that does not fit in a `u64`. The claim is stated in `u128`, so the
  harness does not repeat the implementation's expression back to itself.
- **`every_page_between_the_checked_ends_is_itself_a_user_page`.** Both mapping paths check `va` and
  the run's last address and then walk `va + k * PAGE_SIZE` for `k` in `0..count` with nothing
  re-checking the pages between. Given the two endpoints pass `is_user_page_va`, every page in the
  run does too, and no page is computed past the checked end. `k` is symbolic rather than iterated,
  so this covers every page of every run with no unwind bound.

### And two in `kernel/src/arch/aarch64/iommu.rs` (milestone 255)

The SMMUv3 driver, aarch64's IOMMU. It has no `asm!` in it at all, and what it computes is which
physical addresses a device may touch, which is what `design/fatal-risks.md` risk 7 rests on. The
word arithmetic was inline in `attach`, tangled with the volatile writes that make that function
unreachable; it is now three functions in the same file, and `attach` is shorter for it. **Nothing
moved out of `arch/`**, which is milestone 193's option A held to and milestone 244's refusal of
option B applied again.

- **`the_smmu_is_handed_exactly_the_tables_the_kernel_built`.** The context descriptor's TTB0 and
  the stream table entry's `S1ContextPtr` are each a physical address split across two 32-bit words,
  and each shares its low word with control bits (V, CONFIG and S1FMT sit under the STE's pointer).
  For every page-frame `ttb` and every 64-byte-aligned `ctxptr` below 2^52, both fields read back
  from the built words at the bit positions Arm IHI 0070 gives them are exactly the input, and the
  control field is what it was written as rather than what an overlapping address bit made it. The
  second half is the worse failure: an address bit landing on CONFIG turns the stream to **bypass**,
  which is translation switched off rather than pointed somewhere wrong.
- **`no_stream_can_reach_another_streams_tables`.** `table_offset` is the whole of the addressing
  for both tables and its `assert!` is the only thing between a device-tree-supplied `StreamID` and
  a raw write. For every pair of ids the bound admits, each entry lies inside the single frame that
  holds the table and no two entries share a byte.

**Both were falsified, and the falsifications are the argument.** Each patch leaves every test in
the tree green. QEMU's `virt` board puts RAM at `0x4000_0000`, so bit 31 of a domain root is clear
and `ttb >> 31` agrees with `ttb >> 32` on this board; and the one PCIe disk's requester id is far
below 64, so raising `STRTAB_LOG2` to 7 writes off the end of a frame that nothing ever addresses.
`script/falsifications --sweep kernel` replays both.

**What this does not cover, said here as well as at the harness.** The register offsets and bit
constants are unproved and unprovable in this tree: a harness asserting the constant it was given is
a tautology, and if Arm IHI 0070 was misread then the code and the proof are wrong together. That is
why `the_iommu_faults_a_dma_that_escapes_the_domain` in `kernel/src/virtio.rs` is not made redundant
by this. And **a property proved of the SMMUv3 is not proved of the other two IOMMUs**:
`riscv64/iommu.rs` writes its device context in 64-bit stores with no split at all, so this property
has no counterpart there, and `x86_64/` is not even compiled under Kani on an aarch64 host.

### And two in `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/irq.rs` (milestone 304)

**The first properties this tree has ever checked on `arch/x86_64/`**, and they exist because of a
runner label rather than because of anything clever: until milestone 304 every Kani job in this
repository ran on an aarch64 host, so `arch/x86_64/` was never compiled. Both are about **numbers
firmware chose**, which is the strongest case here for a bounded model checker: a vector is an index
into the IDT, so getting one wrong does not misroute an interrupt, it runs the page-fault handler.

- **`no_vector_belongs_to_two_bands`.** `MSI_VECTOR_BASE`'s doc claims the three vector bands are
  "disjoint by construction rather than by anybody remembering", the construction being
  `MAX_REDIRECTION_ENTRIES` clamping the entry count. This is that claim, over every entry count an
  eight-bit version register can report and every state the MSI bump counter can be in, asked
  through the two predicates the trap handler actually calls rather than restated from the
  constants.
- **`an_owned_gsi_routes_inside_the_io_apic_band`.** For every GSI `redirection_index` admits, the
  flat map lands inside `GSI_VECTOR_BASE..MSI_VECTOR_BASE`. Milestone 255's
  `no_stream_can_reach_another_streams_tables` one architecture over: a firmware-supplied
  identifier, one bounds check, a write that cannot be taken back.

**The second one found a defect, and the harness carries the finding as an assumption.** Without
`kani::assume(base == 0)` it fails: a second IO APIC owning global interrupts from 200, with the 24
entries every real part has, admits GSI 210, and `gsi_vector(210)` wraps onto **vector 2, the NMI**.
`MAX_REDIRECTION_ENTRIES`' doc says this cannot happen and bounds the wrong quantity. Not fixed
here, because the fix costs `gsi_vector` its `const fn` and its total signature: see `irq.rs`'s
module `BUGS` and
`design/roadmap/proposals/the-gsi-vector-map-wraps-on-a-second-io-apic.md`.

**Falsified twice, on cordoba, and the asymmetry is the honest half.** Raising
`MAX_REDIRECTION_ENTRIES` by one turns both red; loosening `redirection_index`'s bound from
`index < entries` to `index <= entries` turns only the second red, correctly, because the first
never calls the guard. Both are recorded `attested` rather than `replayable`, because
`script/falsifications --sweep` runs a named harness on whatever host it is on and an x86_64 harness
does not exist on an aarch64 one; that script's `BUGS` now records the same fact from the sweep's
side.

## Which architecture the prover actually sees

**One, and it is the host's** (milestone 304). This is stub-list item 3, stated as a table because it
is the thing most often read as more coverage than it is.

| host | `arch/` subtree compiled | harnesses that run |
|---|---|---|
| aarch64 (dev Mac; `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners) | `arch/aarch64/` | 4: two in `syscall.rs`, two in `arch/aarch64/iommu.rs` |
| x86_64 (cordoba; the `ubuntu-24.04` runner) | `arch/x86_64/` | 4: the same two in `syscall.rs`, two in `arch/x86_64/irq.rs` |
| riscv64 | **nothing** | **nothing** |

Six distinct harnesses, not eight: `syscall.rs`'s two are portable and run on both. They pass
identically on both hosts, which is the parity question milestone 304 was sent to answer and is a
clean answer rather than an interesting one.

**riscv64 is unreachable and no one here can fix it.** GitHub offers no riscv64 image; Kani has no
cross-target flag (`cargo kani --help` carries `--target-dir` and nothing else); CBMC needs a
goto-binary for the host it runs on; `radon` is a lab board rather than a runner. So
`arch/riscv64/iommu.rs`'s own property, which the SMMUv3 harnesses explicitly do not cover, can be
written and cannot be run.

**One thing had to change before an x86_64 host could compile the kernel at all**, and it was not
about the code. `core::arch::x86_64::__cpuid` is a *safe* function on the toolchain this tree pins
and was an `unsafe fn` until upstream changed it; **Kani bundles its own rustc**, `kani-0.67.0`
pinning `nightly-2025-11-21`. So four bare `__cpuid` calls in `arch/x86_64/` were four `E0133`s
under the prover and nowhere else. They are wrapped in `isa::cpuid` and `isa::cpuid_count`, whose
`#[allow(unused_unsafe)]` is a labelled exception that comes out when Kani's pin catches up.

### Why these two and not the timer

Milestone 193's block nominates the milestone 6 timer re-arm drift as the first property worth
trying, on the grounds that its property is already proved in `crates/timetable`'s `next_after` and
the timer does not call it. That is still a good observation and a good future lane, but **the
re-arm is in `kernel/src/arch/aarch64/timer.rs` and `kernel/src/arch/riscv64/timer.rs`**, which item
2 above puts out of reach: `rearm` reads `CNTVCT_EL0` and writes `CNTV_CVAL_EL0`, both `asm!` through
`aarch64-cpu`. Proving it means first lifting the arithmetic out of the register accesses, and where
that seam goes is a design question rather than a mechanical one.

`run_end_va` was chosen instead on the criterion that matters most given milestone 191's finding:
**it has a real defect on record.** Milestone 142's review, MAJOR 4, found that the old
implementation checked only the addition in `va.checked_add((count - 1) * PAGE_SIZE)`, leaving the
multiply free to wrap, so a large `count` produced a `last_va` a few pages above `va` and the guard
admitted a run spanning the address space.

## EXAMPLES

Prove just the kernel's harnesses, with a counterexample trace on failure:

```console
$ cargo kani -p kernel -Z unstable-options --ignore-global-asm
...
Complete - 4 successfully verified harnesses, 0 failures, 4 total.
```

One harness on its own:

```console
$ cargo kani -p kernel -Z unstable-options --ignore-global-asm \
      --harness the_run_end_is_exact_and_refuses_exactly_what_does_not_fit
```

The whole suite, kernel included, the way CI runs it:

```console
$ script/verify
```

Just the kernel row, which is what the x86_64 CI job runs and the only row whose coverage depends on
the machine it runs on:

```console
$ script/verify --only kernel
```

**Falsify a new harness before you believe it.** This is the tree's standing discipline for proofs
(verification.md says the same) and milestone 191 is the reason it is not optional. Re-introduce the
historical defect and check that both harnesses go red:

```console
$ # in run_end_va, replace the checked arithmetic with milestone 142's bug:
$ #   va.checked_add((count - 1).wrapping_mul(paging::PAGE_SIZE))
$ cargo kani -p kernel -Z unstable-options --ignore-global-asm --output-format=terse
Verification failed for - syscall::proofs::every_page_between_the_checked_ends_is_itself_a_user_page
Verification failed for - syscall::proofs::the_run_end_is_exact_and_refuses_exactly_what_does_not_fit
Complete - 0 successfully verified harnesses, 2 failures, 2 total.
```

Both catch it. That was run on 2026-08-30 and is the reason these two harnesses are worth their
place rather than an assertion that they are.

## Adding a harness to `kernel/src`

1. Put it beside the code it proves, in a `#[cfg(kani)] mod proofs`, not in a separate file. The
   stub list above is the reason: a reader has to meet the caveats where they meet the harness.
2. Check the call graph against the stub list. If it reaches `asm!` or MMIO, stop; you are proving
   nothing, and Kani will say so rather than lie. **`crate::arch` itself is no longer the boundary**
   (milestones 255 and 304 put harnesses inside two of its three subtrees), but ask which
   architecture you are in: a harness under `arch/<isa>/` runs only on an `<isa>` host, and a
   `riscv64` one runs nowhere. That failure is silent, unlike the `asm!` one.
3. Falsify it. Break the code under it and watch the harness fail, then put the code back.
4. `kernel` is already in `script/verify`'s crate table, so nothing needs adding there. If you add a
   harness to a crate that is *not* in that table, `script/lint`'s "every crate with proof harnesses
   is in the verify table" check will fail; that gate exists because two crates
   (`multicast_dns_protocol`, `jh7110_entropy`) each spent months carrying harnesses nothing ran.

## BUGS

- **`kernel/src/arch/` is very nearly unproved, and the part that is proved is two files.**
  Milestone 255 put two harnesses into `arch/aarch64/iommu.rs` and milestone 304 two into
  `arch/x86_64/irq.rs`; that is 1,279 of 16,225 lines. The corpus's own timer re-arm drift is still
  on the far side of the `asm!` boundary and nothing here touches it. (This entry used to pair it
  with "the VisionFive 2 undelivered wake." That reading is **retracted**,
  `notes/visionfive2.md`'s fifth bench stop, 2026-08-15: it was a completed tour's terminal state,
  not a stranded receiver, and never happened. Found still repeating it here 2026-09-23.)
- **Only one architecture's `arch/` is compiled per run, and riscv64's is compiled by nothing.**
  Narrowed by milestone 304 rather than closed: the `kernel` row is now proved on an x86_64 runner
  as well as the aarch64 ones, so two of the three subtrees are reachable on some machine. The third
  is not, and the section above says why nobody here can change that. **`x86_64/machine.rs` is the
  work this unblocked and did not do**: 836 lines of ACPI parsing over lengths, checksums and counts
  that firmware supplied, now reachable for the first time and still carrying no harness. Its
  parsing half already lives in `crates/machine_discovery`, which has no harnesses and no verify
  row; the half in `machine.rs` reads raw pointers into the direct map, which stub-list item 6 says
  to stub rather than pretend. Finding that seam is a lane of its own.
- **Four harnesses is not coverage of a 64,818-line crate**, and the number to watch is not the count
  but whether the properties are ones a defect would violate. The two here were chosen because a
  defect *did* violate them.
- **`--ignore-global-asm` is a global switch, not a per-item one.** A future `global_asm!` block that
  a harness genuinely needs would be skipped silently rather than refused. The reason it is
  acceptable today is that Kani's `asm!` restriction makes any such harness fail for a second, louder
  reason. **"Nothing detects that" was too strong** (measured 2026-09-20 by the
  `maintainer/verus-versus-kani` lane): every run prints
  `warning: Ignoring global ASM in crate kernel. Verification results may be impacted.` That is
  per-run rather than per-item, so it cannot say *which* block was skipped or whether anyone cared,
  which is the substance of the entry; but the run is not silent about having done it.
- **`user/` and `xtask` are still out of reach**, for exactly the reason the kernel was. `user/`
  holds real parsers over untrusted input and has at least as good a claim on the prover as the
  kernel does. Not attempted here.
- **The `kernel` row's 5 seconds in `script/verify`'s table is a dev-Mac number**, like
  `jh7110_entropy`'s, and the wrong machine for that column. Replace it from the
  first CI log that carries it. Almost all of it is the crate's own compile rather than solver time,
  so it will grow with the harnesses and not with the kernel.
- **The `kernel` row is proved on two hosts and means something different on each, which no single
  number in `script/verify`'s table can say.** Its seconds column is one figure for two jobs, and
  the harness count a reader would infer from "the kernel row passed" is the host's rather than the
  tree's. The tree has six kernel harnesses; neither host runs more than four.
- **The paragraph below was the old statement of this and is kept as the account.** It said the
  `kernel` row *needs* an aarch64 host; since milestone 304 it needs an aarch64 host **and** an
  x86_64 one, and the `aarch64-cpu` fix it names as a contingency had already landed on 2026-08-31,
  which is why the second host cost nothing on that axis.
- **The `kernel` row needed an aarch64 host, and nothing enforced that.** `kernel/Cargo.toml` depends
  on `aarch64-cpu` unconditionally, and `crate::arch::mmu::Format` resolves by the host's
  `target_arch` under Kani, so `cargo kani -p kernel` on an x86_64 box would fail to build and would
  be proving a different `Format` if it did. It works today because **every job in
  `.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`**, which is aarch64 Linux, and because
  the dev machine is Apple Silicon. Milestone 193's block predicted the opposite ("CI is x86_64
  Linux and it very likely will not [compile]"); the premise was checked and is false, and the two
  ELF-style `link_section` names it worried about are valid ELF anyway, so only the Mach-O host ever
  rejected them. If that runner label ever changes, this row breaks, and the fix is putting
  `aarch64-cpu` behind a target `cfg`.
- **This note does not price the rest of the work.** What was measured is that the front door opens.
