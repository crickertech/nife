# The TCB (Thread Control Block)

*(Written during milestone 14 phase B, when "where do TCBs live" became a decision.)*

## What it is

The kernel's bookkeeping record for one thread: our `Thread` struct in `kernel/src/thread.rs`.
Milestone 1 defined a thread as "a stack plus a set of register values"; the TCB is where the
kernel keeps everything needed to *manage* that thread while it is not running. Ours holds: the
id (a generational name, notes/generational-names.md), the state, the `context` pointer naming
where the registers are saved on the thread's own stack, ownership of that stack, the address
space, the capability table (`CapabilityTable`), the IPC mailbox, the intrusive queue link
(notes/intrusive-queues.md), and the `on_cpu`/`wake_pending` switch-out flags. "Spawn allocates
a TCB" means allocating this struct. seL4 uses the same name for the same object.

## The acronym collision, so nobody trips on it

**TCB also means Trusted Computing Base** (DECISIONS §14: "a small, machine-checked trusted
core"), which is unrelated. Both senses appear in this project's documents. In milestone 14 and
scheduler contexts, TCB is the thread struct; in §14 and verification contexts, it is the
trusted core. Expand the term when there is any doubt.

## Where TCBs live (the phase B.2 decision)

Decided at B.2: a **static pool**, a MAX_THREADS-sized array in BSS, a Tid's slot bits naming
its storage directly. That pool was always a scaffold: the B.2 note said "the pool upgrades to
retype-backed storage behind the table when init lands."

**Milestone 19c.2 landed that upgrade, and the static pool is gone.** Every `Thread` is now
**page-resident**: it lives at the start of one page, and the generational table stores a
pointer to it rather than indexing a BSS array. Kernel threads' TCB pages come from the kernel's
own budget (`kmem`, notes/kernel-budget.md); a user process (19c.3) retypes its TCB page from
its own untyped by the same mechanism, the page merely coming from a different budget. A page's
address never changes (direct-mapped, its region pinned), which supplies the pinning the `Box`
and then the pool both provided. The win over the pool: the kernel reserves no per-thread memory
it was not handed, the last corner of milestone 14's no-open-ended-spending thesis. Why this is
now worth doing when B.2 said retype earned nothing: B.2's premise was "the kernel is the only
payer," and 19c is exactly when that expires (init becomes a payer).

On the page-granularity worry the pool decision leaned on: a TCB is sub-page, so page-residency
"wastes" most of a page. That was a real reason to prefer the pool *while the kernel paid*, and
it is not one now, because the page is paid by whoever owns the thread (a user thread's by its
creator's untyped, a kernel thread's by `kmem`, both bounded budgets). Sub-page packing stays
declined for the same reason it was for endpoints (19a): one memory rule for the whole object
family, packing a later placement optimization behind the table, not a slab rebuilt in the
milestone that deleted the slab.
