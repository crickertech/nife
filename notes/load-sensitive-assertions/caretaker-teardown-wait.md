# The caretaker teardown wait, 2026-08-27 and 2026-08-28

*(An appendix of [notes/load-sensitive-assertions.md](../load-sensitive-assertions.md), which holds
the register and the rules. Moved here on 2026-09-24 and tightened; pull request #1211's first
commit has the text verbatim.)*

## The fifth round, 2026-08-27: caretaker teardown joins the family, observed rather than rescoped

(The old note numbered two rounds "fifth". The other is
[the fifth round, 2026-08-17](stack-reuse-and-proxy-detectors.md).)

### `caretaker_teardown_reclaims_a_full_session_worth_of_memory` (`user/login_tests.rs`): fails at roughly 2x oversubscription, passes quiet, passes CI

The bench-regression lane of milestone 142 (a text display good enough that people use it) found
this while gating an unrelated change. It is recorded here as an observation with its evidence.
Nothing has been rescoped, and the mechanism is a hypothesis, not a verdict.

The observation: three failing runs and two passing ones on the same tree. The aarch64 suite shared
this host with a second lane's full suite. The harness's own load line read a one-minute average of
14.5 to 16.2 on 8 cores, 1.9 to 2x oversubscribed. The test failed its `F_TEARDOWN_OK` assertion
("login N's logout ticket did not destroy the caretaker's construction region", `left: 0, right:
16`). It failed on login 6, login 6 again, and on login 8 at a clean checkout of the branch head with
no local changes. The same clean-head code passed the whole test in CI's own QEMU leg the same day.
It passed locally, twice, the moment the competing suite finished (the passing run's load line was
back under 1x by the QEMU phase). The failing iteration moving between 6 and 8 is the tell it shares
with the rest of the family: the code path is fixed, the schedule is not.

The hypothesis, unverified: `MemoryRegion::DESTROY` refuses a region that still holds a live
thread, and `login_test_client`'s teardown role has a bounded patience for that refusal. A
session's worth of threads takes longer to finish exiting on a 2x-oversubscribed host than that
patience allows. That is the shape of the reaper-count and address-space-frames verdicts in
[the first verdicts](global-baselines-and-the-drift-law.md), which is why it is recorded in this
register rather than in the test's own file. Whoever picks this up should start from those two
dispositions.

The three network checks fail in the same runs and recover in the same runs (`inbound`, `multicast`,
`smb`: connection refused or reset for the whole window). So the cluster should be read as one
host-load event, not four independent regressions.

## The disposition, 2026-08-28: the teardown wait is a yield count, and now it is a clock

The section above says nothing has been rescoped and the mechanism is a hypothesis. This is the
verdict. It is also the first one this register has had to write about a user program. Every fix
before it reaches for `smp.rs`'s `wait_for` or `testing::TickBudget`, and a process can call neither.

### A correction this lane owes on its own account

It was briefed from the section above and went looking for it in the note. It found the newest
section to be the 2026-08-22 confirmation run, checked `main` as well, and wrote a paragraph saying
the observation had never been written down anywhere. That was false by about an hour. The
observation was on `milestone/142-terminal-size`, and that branch merged (`ac41c827`, in PR #545)
while this lane was running its loaded runs. Both halves are worth keeping. The claim was checked
against `main` and was right when it was checked. It was still wrong, because a branch is not a
record: AGENTS.md's "nobody reads branches", from the reader's side rather than the writer's. A lane
cannot see another lane's branch, so "I checked and it is not in the tree" means "not yet". The
merge decides.

The one trace on `main` the whole time was in a place a reader meets by accident.
`kernel/src/testing.rs`'s `SUITE_PAGE_FRAME_BUDGET` takes its number from CI rather than from this
laptop, because "this milestone's local host reproduces an unrelated, pre-existing flake in
`caretaker_teardown_reclaims_a_full_session_worth_of_memory` that does not occur in CI". A frame
budget's comment is where that fact had been living.

### The hypothesis held in outline and was wrong about the mechanism

The hypothesis: `DESTROY` refuses a region that still holds a live thread, and a session's worth of
threads can outrun the client's patience under load. It reproduced on the first instrumented run, so
the shape is confirmed. The mechanism is not what the words say. The patience is not too small for
the number of threads: there is only ever one thread in that region. It is denominated in the wrong
thing:

```rust
fn destroy_with_retry(ut: u64) -> bool {
    const ATTEMPTS: usize = 64;
    for _ in 0..ATTEMPTS {
        if destroy_region(ut) == 0 { return true; }
        yield_now();
    }
    false
}
```

What the refusal is waiting on is a timer tick. `sched::reap_region_objects` refuses while the
caretaker is still live and arms the kill of §16 (object revocation) on it
(`region_reap_verdict`'s `RefuseAndArm`). An armed kill lands at that thread's next preemption. So
the wait is one tick period, 10 ms at 100 Hz, and a count of syscalls is not a way to buy one. The
direction is positive ("not yet"). By the first diagnostic it is honest load sensitivity, not a wait
written against something wider than the property.

### The measurement, and the number that settles it

The client was instrumented to report what it spent, in attempts and in counter ticks, and the first
run reproduced the failure. Every logout of that run, in order (aarch64, one-minute load average 9.4
to 10.8 on eight cores, as the harness's own host-load line reported):

| logout | attempts | elapsed | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 23 | 5.97 ms | ok |
| 1 | 36 | 10.79 ms | ok |
| 2 | 2 | 8.60 ms | ok |
| 3 | **64** | **8.26 ms** | **red** |

The failing wait is the shortest one in the table. It gave up after 8.26 ms, having spent its whole
budget, where the logout above it took 10.79 ms and passed. Attempts and elapsed time are not the
same axis at all. A `yield_now` that finds work on this core returns in about 130 us, and one that
finds none parks until the next tick. So sixty-four of the first kind elapse in 8 ms, while two of
the second cover 12 ms. Which kind a logout gets is a scheduling outcome the host decides. That is
"a yield count is not a duration", the second round's own sentence, arriving in a program instead of
in the scheduler.

The A/B below produced a cleaner version of the same fact in a single run. The old form gave up on
logout 6 after 26.6 ms, in a run where logout 3 had legitimately taken 39.3 ms and passed.

That also answers the question the section above left open: why the failing iteration wanders (login
6, login 6, login 8 there; login 3 and login 6 here). Nothing distinguishes one logout from another.
Each draws a fresh answer to "does this client's `yield_now` park or return", ten times per run. A
run goes red when any one of the ten draws badly. Ten draws is also why this test surfaced the
family first: the other login tests log out once or not at all.

The three network checks failing together, which the section above flags as one host-load event, is
confirmed here. Read it as a load gauge rather than as noise. `inbound`, `multicast` and `smb` are
host-side checks that talk to the guest over forwarded ports. They went red in exactly the loaded
runs below, including runs whose kernel suite was entirely green. So a transcript with all three red
is a transcript to read as "this host was saturated".

### The fix, and why its bound is the second-best unit

`fixtures/src/login_test_client.rs`'s `destroy_with_retry` now waits on the property (the region
genuinely coming down) and bounds itself with a clock rather than a count. The ceiling is
`DESTROY_WAIT_SECS`, five seconds of counter time. It is a watchdog rather than a rate: only a run
that is going to fail ever pays it, because the loop returns the moment the region comes down.

The ceiling has an argument rather than a feel, and the argument is the tail, measured here:

| condition | waits | worst single wait |
|---|---|---|
| aarch64, no induced load (one-minute load average 7 to 15) | 30 | 12.8 ms |
| aarch64, six spinners (13 to 29) | 40 | 44.3 ms |
| riscv64, six spinners (27 to 47) | 30 | **126.4 ms** |

Five seconds is 40x the worst of those. Being wrong in the generous direction costs this: a
genuinely wedged caretaker takes ten seconds to report (this ceiling twice, the budget and the
region), inside a 90 s per-test harness ceiling. The alternative is reporting in eight milliseconds
and being wrong.

The unit is wall clock, which is the unit [the migration drain](migration-drain-tick-budget.md)
argues against. That is a limitation rather than a disagreement. Milestone 62 (tests that assert on
time) re-denominated `smp.rs`'s drain in delivered timer ticks, precisely because a counter deadline
keeps running while the guest is descheduled. A process cannot do that. `user_mode_runtime::now` is
the raw counter, and nothing publishes the kernel's per-core tick count to userspace. So what makes
this safe is the margin, not the unit, and the margin would have to be re-measured if the wait ever
grew. Giving a process a delivered-tick reading is an ABI addition, which is calef's call rather
than a lane's. It is written in that function's own BUGS section, so the next reader meets it there
and not only here.

The failure message now carries the observation the wait decided on. The client reports its wait in
the third report word (where every other behaviour puts an identity hint, and `LOGOUT` has no
identity to report). The assertion prints it beside the ceiling. A wait near the ceiling means the
caretaker never died, which is a kernel bug. One far under it means the client stopped waiting
early, which is the defect this ceiling replaced. That is the fifth round's panic-message lesson,
applied before anybody had to read a red run at 2 a.m.

### The injection, because a green run proves nothing about a branch it never took

The fourth round's caveat keeps recurring: twelve green runs said nothing about a branch that was
never exercised. So the giving-up path was proven directly. The wait was pointed at a capability
whose `DESTROY` can never succeed: the caretaker's endpoint rather than its region, a one-word edit,
reverted.

```
assertion `left == right` failed: login 0's logout ticket did not destroy the caretaker's
construction region; the client waited 5000100 us for the refusal to clear, against its own ceiling
of 5000000 us. A number near that ceiling means the caretaker never died, which is a kernel bug and
not this host being slow; a number far under it means the client stopped waiting early, which is
the defect that ceiling replaced.
```

The ceiling fires, it fires at the value the constant names, and the message is the one a reader
needs. (An earlier run of the same injection, at the 2 s ceiling this lane started from, printed
2000037 us against 2000000. The ceiling was raised afterwards, on the riscv64 tail above.)

### The runs, all of them

Reporting only the interesting ones would be the dishonesty this milestone exists to remove. Six
spinners were used rather than the recipe's eight, because other lanes were gating on this laptop,
and the fourth round's choice not to fail somebody else's run still applies. The machine supplied
the rest of the contention itself.

| tree | leg | runs | reached the test | logouts | red at this assertion | worst wait |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| old form (64 attempts) | aarch64 | 5 | 4 | 31 | **2** | 94.4 ms, and truncated by the give-up |
| new form (5 s clock) | aarch64 | 8 | 8 | 80 | 0 | 44.3 ms |
| new form (5 s clock) | riscv64 | 3 | 3 | 30 | 0 | 126.4 ms |

Five of those eleven new-form runs carried a 2 s ceiling rather than the 5 s this lane shipped. The
raise happened after the riscv64 tail was measured. It changes nothing about a run that passes,
since the loop returns when the region comes down and never reaches its bound. The tree as it stands
was then run once through all three architectures at one-minute load averages of 13 to 25 (aarch64
300 passed, riscv64 303, x86_64 189 with this test skipped). The skip is for the reason
`fs_service::NO_FS_SERVER` gives, the vendored RedoxFS `aes` dependency, not anything here.

The two old-form reds were at one-minute load averages of about 10 and about 37. That is the range
this laptop sits in whenever two lanes are gating: 2x to 5x oversubscribed on eight cores, not a
pathological host. Of the runs that did not reach the test, one died at `live_swap_tests.rs:263` and
one at `holding_a_lock_masks_the_timer`. Both are in [the unowned reds](unowned-reds.md).

Eleven green runs do not prove the rate is zero. By the rule of three, 0 failures in 110 waits
bounds it near 3%. This is one host, one QEMU build, one load shape, which is the caveat
[the 2026-08-22 confirmation run](confirmation-run.md) attaches to its own 45 runs.

### Three things found on the way, none of them fixed here

`crates/system_initializer::reclaim` is the same loop, in a shipping program. It makes sixty-four
attempts over the same §16 refusal. Its own comment makes the claim this lane's measurement refutes:
"one preemption is enough" is true, and sixty-four yields is not a way to buy one. It was left alone
deliberately. The two failures are different sizes: a test client that gives up early fails a run,
while that one gives up quietly and strands `DIR_JOB_REGION_PAGES` until the machine stops. And
changing the boot path was not this lane's brief. The measurement is recorded in a BUGS section at
`RECLAIM_ATTEMPTS`, where the next reader of that constant meets it.

It is not alone: there are five of these, and two of them trap. Every one waits on the same refusal,
and none has a clock in it.

| site | on exhaustion |
|---|---|
| `crates/system_initializer::reclaim` (`RECLAIM_ATTEMPTS`) | returns; a stranded region |
| `components/src/login.rs`'s `reclaim` (`RECLAIM_ATTEMPTS`) | returns; a stranded region |
| `components/src/swish.rs`'s `await_screen` (`SCREEN_REAP_ATTEMPTS`) | returns; leaks one job's pool |
| `components/src/job_undertaker.rs`'s `collect` (`MAX_ATTEMPTS`) | **`user_mode_runtime::trap()`** |
| `components/src/timetable.rs`'s `collect` (`REAP_ATTEMPTS`) | **`user_mode_runtime::trap()`** |

That is the reading order's fourth grep, and the first that leaves this repository's kernel: a
bounded retry count in a user program, over a syscall that a timer tick has to clear. The scope
note's 39 sites were all kernel (`wait_for`, `free_frames`, `thread_count`, `used()`), so userspace
was never swept at all. It was proposed as a milestone of its own in this lane's report rather than
taken here. (Minted as milestone 185 (sweep userspace's bounded retry loops onto a clock); not
started as of 2026-09-24.)

Two more kernel sites went red under this lane's load and are nobody's yet. Neither is in the scope
note. `user/live_swap_tests.rs:263`, "reclaiming the operator's budget returned 277 of 224 pages", is
a negative-direction failure against a global count. The first diagnostic points straight at a wait
written against something wider than the property. `arch/aarch64/timer.rs:680`, "the timer is not
ticking at all", killed a run before it reached the suite's userspace half. It is a sibling of the
assertions milestone 62 dispositioned, and it was not one of them. Both are recorded in full in
[the unowned reds](unowned-reds.md).
