# The migration drain and the tick budget, 2026-08-18

## The migration drain, 2026-08-18: a budget denominated in what the guest actually got

[The disposition's own acceptance run](timer-assertion-disposition.md) found a new member of the
family, said what the fix was, and did not take it. The site was `smp.rs`,
`a_migrated_kernel_thread_keeps_its_hart_pointer`, red twice in eighteen loaded runs with
`migration workers never drained (59/60 done)`. This lane took it. The verdict is the predicted one,
though in this register the predicted verdict has been wrong twice. The failure is honest
positive-direction load sensitivity, the assertion wants the right thing, and only its unit was
wrong.

### What it proves, what the budget was, and what the budget is

The claim is one line, re-checked on every turn of the drain: no worker ever read a per-CPU pointer
naming a hart other than the one it was running on. Everything else in the test exists to drive that
check. It keeps more cpu-bound kernel threads alive than there are harts, so that idle harts steal
already-preempted ones.

The drain loop has to end, so it carried a second assertion nobody wrote down as a claim: 60 workers
finish inside two seconds of `timer::now()`. That is a claim about the host. `timer::now()` is the
guest's view of a counter that follows the host clock and advances whether or not the guest is
executing. Under contention the budget is spent in wall clock the guest never received. Each worker
is about 40 ms of it. One worker short of sixty is exactly what that deficit looks like at the
margin.

The budget is now 200 delivered timer ticks (`2 * TICK_HZ`, the same two seconds on a quiet
machine). A descheduled emulator misses deadlines rather than gaining them. So fewer ticks arrive per
second of wall clock, and the budget stretches under precisely the condition that made the old one
wrong. This is the drift twins' move (assert the law, not the rate) spent on a wait. The mechanism
was already in the tree: `sched::tests::within_ticks` had done it for
`a_thread_that_never_yields_is_preempted_anyway` in
[the second round](measurement-windows-and-the-load-recipe.md).

What was shared is the arithmetic, not the loop. That is why this is a `testing::TickBudget` rather
than a second `within_ticks` caller. Those two waits poll differently, and both are right to.
`within_ticks` must not yield, because the thing it waits for is a preemption of the waiting thread.
This drain must yield, because it shares a hart with the workers it is draining. It also checks a
second assertion (`BAD`) on every turn, so it cannot be expressed as a condition handed to somebody
else's loop at all. What the two have in common is the budget's arithmetic and its re-anchoring on
migration, and that is now written once.

### The injections, and the first one was too coarse to reach its own target

Every injection was reverted. The middle row is the useful one.

| injection | what it is | result |
|---|---|---|
| `trap_return` restores the frame's `tp` on an S-mode return, unconditionally | the pre-fix stale-tp bug, exactly (§28 (SMP placement)) | **never reached the target test**: red ~40 tests earlier at `a_finished_thread_is_reaped_and_its_memory_returned`, with a rank-45-over-rank-60 lock-order violation |
| the same, gated on a `no_mangle` flag the migration test arms and nothing else | the defect arranged inside this assertion's own window | **red**, `a migrated kernel thread read a per-CPU pointer for the WRONG hart: a stale tp rode a hart migration`, at the drain loop's own line |
| a wave whose workers stop counting themselves done at five | a drain that genuinely cannot finish | **red**, `migration workers never drained (5/12 done) within 200 delivered ticks` |

The first row is [the fifth round's](stack-reuse-and-proxy-detectors.md) lesson in a new subsystem.
That round found that a whole-region frame injection "is too coarse to test anything downstream of
it, so a leak injection aimed at a late test has to be one frame wide". The same is true one layer
down. A per-CPU pointer that goes stale on every S-mode return corrupts the scheduler from the first
migration onward, and the suite dies of it long before the test written to name it. It is a red run
that says "lock order" rather than "stale tp", which is the diagnosis cost this milestone exists to
remove.

So the useful injection is the narrow one, and narrowing it took a flag in the assembly. Anyone
proving this test again should know it: the honest injection for a whole-machine invariant is the
invariant broken inside one test's window, not the invariant broken.

The third row is the half a budget change most needs and is easiest to skip. Re-denominating a bound
is one edit away from widening one. The difference is visible only if you have watched the new bound
fail. It fails, it fails on the first wave, and it prints the count and the unit.

### What the drain actually costs, measured

Six waves per leg, both ISAs, four full loaded runs, with the drain instrumented to print what it
spent (the instrument was reverted; it is not in the shipped tree). The measurement was taken on
this branch merged with `milestone/62-assertion-disposition`. On `main` at these loads the suite
dies at `ticks_arrive_at_the_configured_rate` before it ever reaches `smp.rs`: 3 of 3 runs failed
there in about 60 s each. That is the sibling lane's assertion and its fix, not this one's. It is
stated so the tree the numbers came from is not a guess.

| leg | worst wave, wall clock | worst wave, delivered ticks | margin on the old budget (2000 ms) | margin on the new (200 ticks) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| aarch64 | 316 ms | 41 | 6.3x | 4.9x |
| riscv64 | **1005 ms** | 30 | **2.0x** | 6.7x |

The riscv64 row is the whole argument, and it is one wave rather than an average. That wave took a
second of wall clock and was charged ten ticks in the run it happened in. At 100 Hz a second is a
hundred tick periods. So the emulator was descheduled through roughly nine tenths of it, and the
guest executed for about a tenth of the second the old budget was spending. Two more of those and
the old bound is gone, which is what `59/60 done` was. The tick bound does not move, because the
same starvation that stretches the wall clock is what stops the ticks arriving.

The instrument also caught the hazard the budget type is built around, without being asked to. Four
of the 48 wave measurements printed a wrapped tick delta (`18446744073709551587`, which is -29). The
test thread was stolen onto another hart between the two reads, and `ticks()` is per core
(§11 (per-CPU run queues)). So the subtraction compared two unrelated counters. That is the second
round's `ticks_on` finding arriving in a print statement. It is exactly why `TickBudget` re-anchors
on a change of core rather than subtracting across one. A naive tick budget would have had the bug
it was written to avoid, in 8% of its samples.

### BUGS

- Under load this test loses coverage quietly rather than going red. That is the cost of the fix,
  not a defect it removes. Each worker's lifetime (`life`) is still `frequency() / 25`, a span of
  counter time. A worker whose vCPU is descheduled through most of its 40 ms burns the span without
  executing much. It is preempted fewer times, acquires a saved frame less often, and drives less of
  the migration the test exists to provoke. The failure direction is safe: the test passes having
  proven less, it does not fail having proven nothing. That is why this is recorded rather than
  fixed here. It is the "an assertion whose sensitivity is set by its neighbours" shape
  [the fifth round](stack-reuse-and-proxy-detectors.md) found in the reaper test, arriving through
  the host instead of an upstream test. Denominating `life` in delivered ticks too is the obvious fix
  and is not obviously right. It would stretch the workers and the drain under load, and the
  harness's 90 s per-test ceiling has to hold their product, where today only one factor grows.
  Whoever takes it should measure against the table above rather than reason about it.
- A `TickBudget` that re-anchors on every check never expires, by construction: a thread that
  changed core is given its budget back. Nothing in the tree can make that happen (a steal moves a
  thread far less often than once per poll). The type is deliberately not the last line of defence:
  the harness's per-test wall-clock ceiling fails the run whatever the ticks say. The alternative,
  subtracting across a migration, compares two unrelated per-core counters. That is the defect
  `ticks_on` was added for in the second round.
