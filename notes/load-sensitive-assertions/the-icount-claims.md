# The icount claims: the sixth round, 2026-08-17

*(An appendix of [notes/load-sensitive-assertions.md](../load-sensitive-assertions.md), which holds
the register and the rules. Moved here on 2026-09-24 and tightened; pull request #1211's first
commit has the text verbatim.)*

## The sixth round, 2026-08-17: the instrument, and the two claims it was owed

The five rounds before this re-aimed everything that could be re-aimed. What they could not re-aim,
they deferred to the same place every time, in six separate paragraphs across the old note and the
roadmap block: the icount instrument, recommended and not built. This round built it. It is
`script/icount`, a boot mode rather than a `#[test_case]`, and notes/instruction-clock.md is its note.

### What was actually unaskable, and why no margin was ever going to do

Both remaining claims fail on the same sentence, which the old note stated twice: *from inside the
guest, a slow handler and a descheduled emulator are the same observation.* That is not a
sensitivity problem, so it has no sensitivity fix. Widening hides the defect (§61 (a lint is adopted
on evidence), and the block forbids it by name). Deleting the assertion is what round one already
refused.

The third option is to change the unit. Under `-icount shift=0,sleep=off` virtual time advances by
exactly one nanosecond per guest instruction retired, and by nothing else. So a claim denominated in
instructions has no host term in it at all. Both claims are now stated that way:

| claim | aarch64 | riscv64 | bound |
|---|---|---|---|
| deadline to handler observing it | 1,008 instructions | 300-400 | 2,000 / 1,500 |
| deadline to next one armed (the whole handler) | 1,056 | 800-900 | 2,500 / 2,500 |
| ticks missed over 64 sampled | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The aarch64 numbers are identical across all 64 ticks, minimum equal to maximum. The measurement has
no variance, so a bound on it is a statement about this kernel and nothing else. The riscv64 pair
differ by one counter tick, because that ISA's `rdtime` reads in steps of 100 instructions where
aarch64's counter reads in steps of 16.

### The injection, which is the only part of this that proves anything

The claim that matters is riscv64's, because it is the one milestone 78 (the load-sensitive
assertions) was left holding. SBI's `set_timer` is write-only, so `DEADLINE` is our own array, and
reading it back proves only that the kernel remembers what it meant to write. The block names the
exact residual: *"an implementation that maintains `DEADLINE` correctly and arms SBI with something
else"*.

So that implementation was built and run, twice. Each was a single line in `rearm`, with the grid
store left untouched beside it. Both were reverted.

| injection | `script/icount --arch riscv64` | the riscv64 leg of `script/test` |
|---|---|---|
| `sbi_set_timer(now + interval())`: re-anchor every tick | **red**, arrival 420,400 instructions against a bound of 1,500 | **red**, `the_handler_keeps_up_when_no_lock_is_held` |
| `sbi_set_timer(next + interval() / 4)`: a fixed offset, no drift, no misses, 100 Hz still exactly delivered | **red**, arrival 2,500,400 on every one of 64 ticks | **red**, `ticks_arrive_at_the_configured_rate` |

The prediction was that the suite would miss them, and it did not. What the suite cannot do is say
what is wrong. The first injection fails as *"the timer handler is taking longer than a whole tick
period, with no lock held... Late by less than one interval means the handler itself is slow, which
is this kernel's bug"*. That is false, and it is the assertion that broke #204, #210 and #215 in one
afternoon. The second fails as *"no miss-free measurement window in eight tries: either the host is
too contended to observe the grid, or the handler is slower than a whole tick period"*. Its first
clause is an invitation to re-run.

The icount message names the actual defect: *"either the trap path grew, or the timer was armed with
something other than the deadline the kernel recorded"*, on a number with no host term in it.

So what the instrument buys is diagnostic certainty rather than detection, which is the milestone's
own thesis. The block's cost line is that every red check here needs a human to decide "known or
real". On 2026-08-03 that judgement was made six times and was wrong twice. Both injections produce
exactly that judgement call on the test path, and none of it on the instrument.

A third injection asked what the instrument can see, rather than whether it fires: exactly 200
instructions added to the aarch64 `tick`. Arrival went 1,008 -> 1,216 and the handler 1,056 ->
1,264, both +208 on every one of 64 ticks. The eight-instruction residual (the loop's operand setup)
is smaller than one counter tick. That is the resolution measured. It is what lets the instrument
answer the pricing question of milestone 106 (a wait that ends on either the interrupt or the
deadline) on aarch64.

### What the instrument cost, and a correction it forced

The block stated the cost as *"icount is slower and changes what the suite measures"*. The first
half had never been measured, and it is wrong. The same bench boot took 2.47-2.61 s under
`-icount shift=0,sleep=off` and 2.62-2.80 s without it, three runs each, on the same binary.
`sleep=off` fast-forwards virtual time through idling, which covers icount's per-instruction
overhead.

The two real reasons are different and better. Every vCPU shares one virtual clock, so the
instrument is `-smp 1`. A suite run there would not fail; it would silently stop proving every
cross-core property it exists for. And a clock-bound wait stops costing host time and starts costing
instructions, at roughly five to one. The first reason is the same fact that keeps the placement
probe on the wall clock, arriving from the other side.

### What this round did not do

The other sites in the scope note were still not audited. Five rounds have now said this. The
reading order (three greps: a global count as a baseline, a loop with no clock, a frame count
standing in for a mechanism) is the accumulated answer, and nobody has run it across the remaining
files.

Only the timer is instrumented. `tick_trace` is three relaxed counters and one call site, not a
framework. Any other path wanting an instruction-denominated claim needs its own. That is
deliberate: the block asked for two claims, not for infrastructure.

Correction (2026-08-18): claims 1 to 3 above turned out to be blind to the drift defect, and a
fourth claim was added. See [the timer disposition](timer-assertion-disposition.md).
