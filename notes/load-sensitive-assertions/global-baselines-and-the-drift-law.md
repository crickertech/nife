# Global baselines and the drift law: the first verdicts, 2026-08-03

*(An appendix of [notes/load-sensitive-assertions.md](../load-sensitive-assertions.md), which holds
the register and the rules. Moved there verbatim on 2026-09-24; "this page" and "above" in the text
below meant the single note it came from.)*

*(Milestone 78. `kernel/src/sched.rs`, `kernel/src/user/tests.rs`, the timer drift twins in
`kernel/src/arch/riscv64/timer.rs` and `kernel/src/arch/aarch64/timer.rs`, `kernel/src/smp.rs`,
and the frame-hygiene assertion already removed from `kernel/src/user/live_swap_tests.rs`.)*

On 2026-08-03 five distinct assertions had failed pull requests that changed no executable code.
The roadmap block (design/roadmap.md, milestone 78) holds the evidence table; this note records
what was done about each and why, because the verdicts are per assertion and the arguments are the
deliverable.

## The diagnostic that sorts the family

**A slow machine produces a deficit, never a surplus.** Host contention deschedules the guest's
vCPUs, so work the test is waiting on happens late or not yet. That can only make a count *lower*
than a wait expected: fewer ticks delivered, a thread not yet run, frames not yet returned. So the
direction of a failure is the diagnosis:

- A failure in the **positive** direction ("not yet") is honest load sensitivity. The fix, if any,
  is to wait on the property itself with the watchdog as backstop, which is `smp.rs`'s documented
  `wait_for` argument.
- A failure in the **negative** direction (fewer threads than the baseline, more free frames than
  at the start) is not a timeout at all. The assertion was written against something wider than the
  property under test, and state arriving from *outside* the measured window tripped it: a
  neighbouring test's teardown landing late. `notes/riscv-parity-scope.md` named this shape ("a
  wait written against something wider than the property") and the BUGS section of
  `notes/live-replacement.md` is the completed analysis of one instance.

The second kind cannot be fixed by margins. Widening a bound that fires on a negative discrepancy
only hides the defect, which is DECISIONS §61's reasoning about the dropped lints, applied to
assertions.


## The verdicts

### Reaper count (`sched.rs`, `a_finished_thread_is_reaped_and_its_memory_returned`): rescoped

Failed as "finished threads were never reaped, left: 5, right: 6". The count was *below* its
baseline: eight reaped threads cannot produce that, but one baseline-counted thread exiting
mid-test does. The test sampled `thread_count()` at the top and asserted the table returned to it,
so its baseline was a number the rest of the system moves on its own.

Now each batch keeps the eight `Tid`s it spawned and waits for `thread_present` to go false on
each. That is the property the test is responsible for ("the threads this batch created were
reaped"), and it is immune to neighbours by construction: a generational `Tid` resolving to
nothing means *this* thread is gone, whatever else the table is doing. Third appearance of this
exact fix; `reclaim_frees_a_started_then_exited_childs_regions` got it first (see
riscv-parity-scope.md) and `thread_present`'s doc comment already argued it.

The frame half of the test also changed direction: the second batch's cost is asserted as
`used() <= before` (waited on, clock-bounded) rather than `==`. A leak, the milestone-6 bug the
test guards, leaves `used` *above* `before` forever, so the wait times out and fails exactly as
before. Equality additionally demanded that no other test free a frame during the window, which is
the neighbour exposure again, in the frame allocator instead of the thread table.

### Address-space frames (`user/tests.rs`, `a_dead_user_thread_frees_its_whole_address_space`): rescoped

The recorded failure is "-19 frames did not come back", on CI (milestone 71's lane, and again on
PR #50's build+test job on 2026-08-03) and once on a quiet aarch64 dev machine. Negative: `used()`
settled 19 frames *below* the baseline, so the wait for equality could never succeed. The frames
arrived from outside the measured window; the test's own settle loop (two agreeing samples before
taking the baseline) already rules out its own in-flight frees, which is how we know the source is
a neighbour.

Same two changes as the reaper test: the reap waits are per-`Tid` (`thread_present` on the outlaw
just spawned, replacing `thread_count() <= baseline`), and the final assertion waits for
`used() <= before`. Leak sensitivity is unchanged: every frame an outlaw's address space keeps
holds `used()` above `before` forever.

### Frame hygiene (`user/live_swap_tests.rs`): already removed, nothing to do

Removed 2026-08-03 in PR #46 with the completed analysis in `notes/live-replacement.md`'s BUGS
section; the tree confirms it gone, replaced by a comment saying why. The removal is not a
counterexample to "deletion is not the fix": the property the test is responsible for (the budget
reclaim returns exactly `SWAPPER_BUDGET_PAGES`) was already asserted twelve lines above, so the
global count added only the neighbour exposure. Milestone 78's postscript records the same.

### Timer drift (`ticks_arrive_at_the_configured_rate`, both ISAs): re-aimed at the re-arm law

The old assertion compared delivered ticks to elapsed counter time, one period of slack each way.
`script/test` passes no `-icount`, so the guest counter follows host time: a host that deschedules
the vCPU for a few periods coalesces ticks into exactly the deficit the re-arm-from-`now` defect
produced, and it failed under load on `rv64`, the control model. No margin separates "our re-arm
is late" from "the emulator was not running"; widening changes how often you notice, not what is
measured.

The milestone named only the riscv64 site, but the aarch64 twin supplied its own evidence during
this lane's first gate run (2026-08-03): "timer drift: 22 ticks in 25 periods" at
`arch/aarch64/timer.rs`, on an otherwise green suite, while the host compiled the std farm beside
QEMU. A deficit, the coalescing signature, on the ISA the milestone had no drift evidence for.
Both twins got the same fix, which parity requires anyway: a test that measures the wrong thing on
one ISA measures it on both.

The property the test was written for (re-arming relative to `now` compounds lateness: TVAL on
aarch64, `now() + interval` on riscv64) is the **grid law**. The grid is state the kernel owns on
both ISAs: `CNTV_CVAL_EL0` on aarch64, readable back out of the hardware, and the software
`DEADLINE` array on riscv64, kept because SBI's `set_timer` is write-only. So both tests now
assert the law directly: over a window in which `MISSED_TICKS` did not move, the deadline advanced
by exactly one interval per delivered tick. The defect fails this on the first tick, because each
re-arm overshoots the grid by the handler latency. A descheduled emulator cannot fail it: a
deschedule long enough to slip the grid increments `MISSED_TICKS` (the re-anchor safety valve, and
correct behaviour), and the window is retried. A small `deadline()` accessor was added beside
`missed_ticks()` on each ISA. One wall-clock bound survives because contention cannot falsify it:
descheduling only drops ticks, so *more* ticks than elapsed periods still fails, which is
`rearm`'s spin-forever failure mode.

What moved out of scope rather than being weakened: the end-to-end claim that SBI actually fired
at the software grid's deadlines. Under `-icount shift=0,sleep=off` virtual time is a
deterministic function of instructions executed, so the icount instrument (`script/bench`) is
where that claim is checkable without the host as a confound. Recommended, not built here; see the
milestone report. Until then the residual gap is an implementation that maintains `DEADLINE`
correctly but arms SBI with something else, which no wall-clock margin could distinguish from load
either.

### Placement probe (`smp.rs`, `work_can_be_placed_on_every_core`): left alone, and that was wrong

***Superseded on 2026-08-04. The argument below is kept because it is the argument that failed, and
because the way it failed is the useful part. The verdict that replaced it is "the second round"
below.***


Checked against the same question and it already passes. The wait (`wait_for(done)`, 60 s,
subordinate to the 90 s watchdog) is on exactly the property under test, not a proxy: `done` is
"each core's probe has marked its own core". Its failure direction is purely positive ("has not
happened yet"), so load produces late passes and honest timeouts, never a wrong measurement, and
the file's own comment block carries the argument for the budget. Moving it to the icount
instrument is not an option even in principle: the subject is genuinely cross-core wall clock, and
the icount bench boots `-smp 1` *because* icount's shared virtual clock makes multi-hart timing
fictional (notes/benchmarks.md). A cross-core delivery test cannot run on a one-core instrument.

### Round-robin fairness (`sched.rs`, `threads_round_robin`): rescoped

Failed once ("thread {i} never ran") and passed on re-run. The window was 300 yields, and a yield
count is not a duration: §28 scatters the three threads across cores, and on a contended host the
test core burns 300 cheap yields before a starved vCPU has run its thread at all. That is the
exact defect `smp.rs` documented and fixed in its own waits on 2026-07-30.

The test now waits on the property (every counter above zero), clock-bounded by the module's
`wait_for`, and asserts the wait succeeded. It also waits for its three threads to be reaped
before returning, so its own teardown is not the late-landing state a later test's accounting
finds in flight; this test was a candidate supplier for the reaper test's baseline drift, three
tests upstream of it in the same file.

## Postscript: a fast machine finds the same family (milestone 81, 2026-08-04)

The day after this landed, the aarch64 suite was run on the physical Apple Silicon core under
Hypervisor.framework for the first time (notes/hvf-leg.md), and **every** failure it produced was
this family, found from the **opposite direction**: five of them, one per run, in `sched.rs`
(three), `user/reap_tests.rs` and `user/supervision_tests.rs`. Four were yield counts standing in
for a wait (one `yield_now()`, then 100, then 4000, then 2000). The fifth,
`a_thread_that_never_yields_is_preempted_anyway`, was a vacuity guard racing a scheduling order.

The diagnostic above needs one word added to stay right. "A slow machine produces a deficit" is
true, but the deficit's cause is that **a yield count is not a duration**, and that is symmetric: a
loaded host burns cheap yields while another vCPU is descheduled, and a native host burns them in
nanoseconds while another core has not been dispatched at all. Both arrive as "the thing I was
waiting for has not happened yet", both are positive-direction failures, and both take the same
fix, which is to wait on the property with the clock as the bound. So the checklist for reading any
of the remaining 34 sites does not change; only the reason to expect a hit does.

The timer verdicts came through untouched, which is the stronger result: none of the re-aimed
assertions failed on a machine where guest time *is* host time and there is no icount instrument.
Aiming a test at the re-arm law instead of at elapsed wall clock made it accelerator-independent,
which is a property this note could not have claimed the day it was written.
