# Somebody else's crate: what crates.io does against the nife `std`

*(Milestone 64, measurement phase, 2026-08-04. Milestone 27 built a `std` platform layer on the
native ABI (notes/std.md) and claimed it widened real workloads to "most of crates.io that stays off
fs and threads". This note is the attempt to find out whether the qualifier is doing as much work as
it sounds like. Fifty crates were taken off crates.io and built against the patched `std`; this is
what happened and why.)*

**The short answer: the qualifier was pessimistic, and the table was measuring the wrong thing.**
`std::fs` answering `Unsupported` for 32 of 54 functions is not what stops crates from building.
**39 of 50 probes built with no change at all**, including `regex`, `serde_json`, `tokio`'s
current-thread runtime, `rayon`, `clap`, `chrono` and `walkdir`. Of the 11 that failed, **eight
failed on one crate**, and it is not part of `std`.

> **The split is 43/7 today, and it was 39/11 before `entropy_backend` landed** (re-derived
> 2026-08-18, milestone 64's third pass, by `script/crate-probes`, which is now the measurement
> rather than the recipe below). Both numbers are one command apart and both are real: bare
> `script/crate-probes` gives 43 built and 7 failed, and `script/crate-probes --no-backend` runs
> the same fifty without this tree's `getrandom` answer.
>
> The four crates between them are `rand`, `uuid`, `gix-object` and `gix-actor`, which is exactly
> class A's remainder, and the second run was checked against those four rather than assumed: all
> four still stop at `getrandom`'s `compile_error!` without the backend. **So 39 "built with no

> of those, still true and no longer the interesting one. `entropy_backend` is eleven lines and two
> lines of consuming config; calling that "a change" and 43 crates "not building" was the reading
> that kept the number down.
>
> **The number before that was 35/15, and it was wrong for thirteen days** (corrected 2026-08-17).
> The headline **double-counted the four crates that appear in two failure classes at once**:
> `zip` and `ring` are in class A *and* class C; `gix-config` and `gix` are in class A *and* class
> B. Summing the class headings gives 8 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 15, and the distinct crates behind them are
> eleven. The tables below were right all along; only the sentence over them was wrong, which is why
> nothing caught it. Three hand re-derivations of one measurement produced two wrong headlines,
> which is why `script/crate-probes` exists: a measurement a reader cannot re-run is a claim.

**The long answer has a sting in it, and it is the block's own BUGS entry made concrete:** a crate
that compiles is not a crate that works. `tempfile` builds and links, and every one of its
operations returns "operation not supported on this platform" at runtime, because it has an explicit
fallback arm for platforms it does not know. Nothing in a green build says so. See
[What compiles and still does nothing](#what-compiles-and-still-does-nothing).

## How to reproduce this

```sh
script/crate-probes                  # all fifty: the table and the split
script/crate-probes regex tokio      # two of them
script/crate-probes --no-backend     # the same fifty without entropy_backend
script/crate-probes --keep           # leave the generated probe crates and their build logs
```

**PROVISIONAL NAME** (milestone 64, 2026-08-18): script names are calef's and this one is not
ratified.

It takes the account-wide `nife-dev` link (it calls `cargo xtask std-src`) and it needs the network,
so it is not a CI gate and `script/test` does not run it. It builds for aarch64 only, deliberately:
the PAL speaks the capability ABI rather than an ISA, so a second target would re-measure the same
thing at twice the cost, and the parity that matters is `std_exerciser`'s, which `script/test` runs
on both.

**A failing probe is rebuilt for the host**, and reports `BODY` rather than `FAIL` if the host build
fails too. That is the harness saying "my own call site is wrong, ignore this row", which is the
check fifty hand-written `main`s could not give anyone.

### What the harness is doing, which was this recipe

One throwaway crate per probe, built against the linked `nife-dev` toolchain:

```sh
cargo xtask std-src                      # build/refresh the patched-std farm, link nife-dev
mkdir -p /tmp/probe/src && cd /tmp/probe
cat > Cargo.toml <<'EOF'
[package]
name = "probe"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
[workspace]
[dependencies]
regex = "1"
[profile.release]
panic = "abort"
EOF
echo 'fn main() { println!("{}", regex::Regex::new("^a+$").unwrap().is_match("aaa")); }' > src/main.rs

RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=nife-dev cargo build --release \
    -Zjson-target-spec \
    -Zbuild-std=core,alloc,std,panic_abort \
    -Zbuild-std-features=compiler-builtins-mem \
    --target /path/to/nife/targets/aarch64-unknown-nife.json
```

**Build a `[[bin]]`, not a `[lib]`, and this is not a detail.** A library target is never linked, so
a crate whose only blocker is a missing C library passes. `diesel` with the `sqlite` feature compiles
clean and then fails at `rust-lld: error: unable to find library -lsqlite3`. The first pass of this
measurement used libraries and recorded `diesel` as a pass.

**And the `main` must CALL the crate**, which is the same rule one notch further in and which the
2026-08-17 re-derivation found by tripping over it. A `[[bin]]` whose body is `fn main() {}` declares
the dependency, compiles it, and still does not link it, so `diesel` passed again until the probe was
given `SqliteConnection::establish(":memory:")` to call, at which point `-lsqlite3` came back exactly
as recorded. The rule that covers both: **a probe proves nothing the linker was not asked to do.**

Set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to one shared directory across probes so build-std compiles the patched `std`
once (about 10 seconds) instead of once per crate.

## What happened, by crate

Fifty crates, resolved versions as of 2026-08-04, built for `aarch64-unknown-nife`.

### Built with no change (39)

| crate | version | why it was probed |

| `hashbrown` | 0.15.5 | the floor |
| `nom` | 8.0.0 | parser |
| `regex` | 1.13.1 | parser, heavy generics |
| `httparse` | 1.10.1 | wire format |
| `semver` | 1.0.28 | parser |
| `url` | 2.5.8 | parser, 36-crate closure |

| `miniz_oxide` | 0.8.9 | compression |
| `log` | 0.4.33 | ubiquitous facade |
| `anyhow` | 1.0.104 | ubiquitous errors |
| `thiserror` | 2.0.19 | ubiquitous errors |
| `once_cell` | 1.21.4 | sync primitive |
| `bytes` | 1.12.1 | buffers |
| `chrono` | 0.4.45 | wall-clock time |
| `time` | 0.3.55 | wall-clock time |
| `tempfile` | 3.27.0 | fs, and see the sting below |
| `walkdir` | 2.5.0 | fs traversal |
| `fs-err` | 3.x | fs, names every call it makes |
| `ignore` | 0.4.33 | fs plus threads |
| `crossbeam-channel` | 0.5.16 | threads |
| `rayon` | 1.12.0 | threads |
| `num_cpus` | 1.17.0 | reports parallelism |
| `mio` | 1.2.2 | (with no features; see `rocket`) |

| `clap` | 4.6.5 | ubiquitous CLI |
| `tracing` | 0.1.44 | ubiquitous observability |
| `gix-hash` | 0.20.1 | milestone 99 leaf |

Twelve of these were rebuilt as **executables** that call the crate for real (`serde_json` round
trip, `regex` match, `flate2` gzip round trip, `walkdir` over `.`, `chrono::Utc::now`, `clap` parse,
a `tokio` current-thread `block_on`, `csv` records, `tempfile::NamedTempFile::new`,
`fs_err::read_to_string`, `rayon` parallel sum). All twelve linked. **Whether they work is a
different question**, answered below and not by this measurement.

### Failed, and why (11 crates, in four classes)

Every failure is one of four classes. The class matters much more than the crate, which is why the
classes are the headings; **four crates are in two classes at once**, and adding the class headings
up is what produced the wrong 15 above.

| crate | classes |
|---|---|
| `rand`, `uuid`, `gix-object`, `gix-actor` | A only |
| `zip`, `ring` | A, then C |
| `gix-config`, `gix` | A, then B |
| `tar` | B |
| `diesel` | C |
| `rocket` | D |

#### Class A: `getrandom` has no `nife` backend (8 of 11), **closed 2026-08-17**

`rand`, `uuid`, `zip`, `gix-object`, `gix-actor`, `gix-config`, `gix`, `ring` all die on the same
`compile_error!`:

```
error: target is not supported. You may need to define a custom backend see:
       https://docs.rs/getrandom/0.3.4/#custom-backend
```

`getrandom` selects a backend on `target_os`, and there is no `nife` arm. This is not a `std` gap
at all: `std::random::SystemRng` works (milestone 56, slot 6). It is one crate in the ecosystem that
predates us.

**It is also the cheapest thing on this list to fix, and that was measured rather than assumed.**
`getrandom` 0.3 and 0.4 both document a custom backend: build with
`RUSTFLAGS='--cfg getrandom_backend="custom"'` and define one function. With a stub backend that
fills from `std::random::SystemRng`, six of the eight went from failing to building:

| crate | round 1 | with a custom `getrandom` backend |
|---|---|---|
| `rand` 0.9.5 | FAIL | **PASS** |
| `uuid` 1.24.0 | FAIL | **PASS** |
| `gix-object` 0.51.1 | FAIL | **PASS** |
| `gix-actor` 0.36.1 | FAIL | **PASS** |
| `gix-features` 0.45 | FAIL | **PASS** |
| `gix-hash` 0.20.1 | (passed) | **PASS** |
| `zip` 5.1.1 | FAIL | FAIL (class C: `zstd-sys`) |
| `gix-config` 0.48.0 | FAIL | FAIL (class B: `gix-sec`) |
| `gix` 0.74.1 | FAIL | FAIL (class B: `gix-sec`) |
| `ring` 0.17.14 | FAIL | FAIL (class C: C sources) |

The backend used for the probe:

```rust
#![feature(random)]
use std::random::{Rng, SystemRng};

#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
unsafe extern "Rust" fn __getrandom_v03_custom(
    dest: *mut u8,
    len: usize,
) -> Result<(), getrandom::Error> {
    let buf = unsafe { core::slice::from_raw_parts_mut(dest, len) };
    SystemRng.fill_bytes(buf);
    Ok(())
}
```

Note the symbol is `__getrandom_v03_custom` for **both** 0.3 and 0.4; `getrandom` 0.4.3's
`backends/custom.rs` still declares the v03 name. `getrandom` 0.2, which `ring` pulls, uses a
different mechanism (the `register_custom_getrandom!` macro), so a fix has to cover two shapes.

**The right fix is probably not the custom hook**, because the hook is a `RUSTFLAGS` setting that
every consumer has to remember and that a workspace cannot express per-dependency. `getrandom` 0.4
carries a `hermit.rs` backend selected by `target_os = "hermit"`, which is exactly the shape this
project's `std` already took from Hermit. An upstream arm, or a patch under `patches/`, is a
decision for whoever picks this up.

##### What was decided, and where the paragraph above was wrong

**`entropy_backend` is the answer** (milestone 64, 2026-08-17), and it is the custom hook
after all. The objection above is half right: the flag is a `RUSTFLAGS` setting, and a consumer that
forgets it gets the same `compile_error!`. But **a workspace states it once, in its own
`.cargo/config.toml`**, and per-workspace is the correct granularity anyway, because whether an
entropy source exists is a property of the target rather than of any one dependency. "Cannot express
per-dependency" was true and was not the requirement.

What tipped it was the other side of the ledger. A `[patch.crates-io]` fork needs no flag at the call
site, which is genuinely nicer, and costs a maintained fork of a crate this very note recorded as
**mid-transition across 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 inside one dependency graph**. §46's rule is that we vendor
where correctness is won by exposure; a hook the upstream crate designed for this case is neither
that nor code we would otherwise write, and it is eleven lines that upstream cannot break without
also breaking Hermit's.

**The upstream arm is still the right long-term fix and is a smaller diff than the hook.** It is a
pull request against `getrandom`, not a change to this tree.

Three things about the recipe, and the third cost an hour:

1. Depend on `entropy_backend`.
2. `rustflags = ["--cfg", "getrandom_backend=\"custom\""]` in the consuming workspace's
   `.cargo/config.toml`.
3. **`use entropy_backend as _;` in the binary.** An rlib nothing references is not linked, so
   without this the build reaches `rust-lld: error: undefined symbol: __getrandom_v03_custom`. Two of
   the eight probes linked without it because they happened to call `getrandom` on a path the linker
   kept; six did not. Same shape as a `no_std` panic handler: a crate that exists to define a symbol
   has to be pulled in on purpose.

Re-measured with it, on 2026-08-17:

| crate | with `entropy_backend` |
|---|---|
| `rand` 0.9 | **PASS** |
| `uuid` 1 | **PASS** |
| `gix-object` 0.51 | **PASS** |
| `gix-actor` 0.36 | **PASS** |
| `gix-config` 0.48 | FAIL, class B (`gix-sec`) |
| `gix` 0.74 | FAIL, class B (the `errno` crate now, not `gix-sec`) |
| `zip` 5 | FAIL, class C (`zstd-sys`) |
| `ring` 0.17 | FAIL, `getrandom` **0.2**, whose hook is the `register_custom_getrandom!` macro |

**Four of eight, which is exactly what the 2026-08-04 stub reached**, and the point is the other
four: not one of them still fails on `getrandom`'s dispatch. Class A is closed and what is left
behind it is classes B and C, which are different work.

#### Class B: the crate falls through to `unix` (3 of 11)

`tar` (via `filetime` 0.2.29) and `gix-config`/`gix` (via `gix-sec` 0.12.2) both do a
`cfg_if`-shaped dispatch whose **last arm assumes unix**:

```
error[E0433]: cannot find `unix` in `os`
  --> gix-sec-0.12.2/src/identity.rs:36:26
   |
36 |             use std::os::unix::fs::MetadataExt;
error[E0425]: cannot find function `geteuid` in crate `libc`
```

This is the class that says something about us rather than about them. There is no
`std::os::nife`, `libc` has no `nife` module, and a crate whose platform ladder ends in "else
it is unix" cannot compile here. The three crates that hit it are asking for a **uid** and a
**file mtime set**, neither of which this system has in the form they want.

Contrast `tempfile`, which has an explicit `other.rs` arm and therefore compiles. **The distinction
between the 35 and this class is entirely whether the crate author wrote a fallback**, and nothing
about how hard the crate is.

#### Class C: a C library or C sources (3 of 11)

- `ring` 0.17.14: builds C and assembly, and `cc` cannot find `assert.h` for this target.
  `fatal error: 'assert.h' file not found`.
- `zip` 5.1.1 (via `zstd-sys`): same shape, a C build script.
- `diesel` 2.3.11 with `sqlite`: **compiles** and fails at link,
  `rust-lld: error: unable to find library -lsqlite3`.

These are jobs for the C seam (notes/c-seam.md), not for the `std` PAL. They are also the only class
where "make it build" and "make it work" are the same task.

#### Class D: a socket/fd model that does not exist (1 of 11)

`rocket` 0.5.1 fails in `socket2` 0.6.5 and then `mio` 1.2.2:

```
error: Socket2 doesn't support the compile target
error[E0432]: unresolved import `crate::sys::IoSourceState`
```

`mio` with **no** features compiles (its `sys` module is empty), which is why it appears in the pass
list; the moment anything asks for the reactor it does not. This is the same shape as class B, one
level up: a readiness-based IO model wants file descriptors and a poller, and neither exists here.

## What compiles and still does nothing

`tempfile` 3.27.0 selects its platform like this:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(any(unix, target_os = "redox", target_os = "wasi"), path = "unix.rs")]
#[cfg_attr(windows, path = "windows.rs")]
#[cfg_attr(not(any(unix, target_os = "redox", target_os = "wasi", windows)), path = "other.rs")]
mod platform;
```

`other.rs` is six functions, and every one of them is:

```rust
Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, "operation not supported on this platform"))
```

So `tempfile` builds, links, and returns an error from `NamedTempFile::new()`. That matters far
beyond `tempfile`, because **gitoxide's atomicity story runs through it**: `gix-lock`'s commit calls
`self.inner.persist(&resource_path)`, which is `gix-tempfile`, which is `tempfile::persist`, which
on nife is `not_supported()`. A `gix` that built cleanly would fail to write a single ref.

> **That paragraph was wrong about which failure came first, and the correction is worse than the
> claim** (2026-08-18, milestone 64's third pass). Until that day `NamedTempFile::new()` did not
> return an error: it **aborted the process**. `tempfile::env::temp_dir()` delegates straight to
> `std::env::temp_dir`, nife had no `sys/paths` backend, and the shared fallback's `temp_dir()` is

> conclusion above, which is the point worth keeping. `temp_dir` now answers, `other.rs` now gets

> always described.**

The lesson for milestone 99 and 66 is a sequencing one. **Do not read a passing build as a working
crate**, and do not order the work by what fails to compile: `tempfile` never appears on a build
failure list and is on the critical path for git.

## The prioritised gap list

This is the deliverable milestones 99 and 66 consume. It is **not** the order the milestone 27 table
suggests, because that table counts functions and this counts demand.

The method: for each probe, take `cargo tree -e normal --target aarch64-unknown-nife.json` (normal
edges only, so `cc`, `autocfg`, `vcpkg` and every proc-macro crate are excluded, since those run on
the **host** and can call anything they like), then grep every package's `src/` for call sites of the
std APIs the PAL refuses. The "probes" column is how many of the 50 dependency closures contain at
least one call site.

**Six rows in this table were stale until 2026-09-05** (milestone 259's notes sweep), all in the
same direction: `Unsupported` where milestone 64 had since bound the call. The table's own
annotations are what made it obvious, because five of the six already carried a **verb exists**
note, which is a gap list saying out loud that it is one binding away and then not being reread
when the binding landed. The PAL's own header (`sys/fs/nife.rs`) had recorded all six under "Also
bound since milestone 64" and nothing propagated it here. Nothing gates this; the only mechanism is
somebody reading the PAL and this page together.

| rank | gap | PAL today | probes | packages | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `getrandom` backend | **CLOSED** 2026-08-17 | 8 failed outright | `rand`, `uuid`, `ring`, all of `gix` | not a std gap; the `entropy_backend` workspace crate (named by calef, 2026-08-18). This cell said `patches/getrandom-nife`, which has never existed under that name |
| 2 | `std::os::unix` fallthrough | absent, **declined** | 21 | 34 | mostly benign (behind `cfg(unix)`); fatal in `filetime`, `gix-sec`. See below |
| 3 | `thread::spawn` | `Unsupported`, **decided** | 20 | 33 | `rayon`, `crossbeam`, `tokio`, `diesel`. The fork was resolved by DECISIONS §105 (2026-08-22): declined for want of a customer, not for want of a mechanism. See below, and notes/thread-spawn-fork.md |
| 4 | `env::var` | **CLOSED** 2026-08-17 | 16 | 24 | `chrono` (TZ), `clap`, `gix`, `figment`; `vars()` used to **panic** |
| 5 | `fs::create_dir(_all)` | **CLOSED**, milestone 64 | 11 | 17 | bound on `MKDIR`. `create_dir_all` also needed rank 19a |
| 6 | `available_parallelism` | `Ok(1)` | 11 | 7 | already answers honestly |
| 7 | `fs::read_link` | `Unsupported` | 10 | 10 | no symlinks in the contract |
| 8 | `File::set_len` | **CLOSED** 2026-08-17 | 10 | 9 | `TRUNCATE` existed all along; only the size word was missing |
| 9 | `fs::symlink_metadata` | **already bound** | 9 | 13 | the row was stale: std routes it to `lstat`, which this PAL binds |
| 10 | `std::os::fd` | absent | 9 | 12 | `mio`, `memmap2`, `is-terminal` |
| 11 | `fs::read_dir` | **CLOSED**, milestone 64 | 8 | 13 | bound on `OPENDIR` and `READDIR` |
| 12 | `fs::remove_file` | **CLOSED**, milestone 64 | 7 | 12 | bound on `UNLINK` |
| 13 | `fs::remove_dir(_all)` | **CLOSED**, milestone 64, with `remove_dir_all` at milestone 122 | 7 | 8 | bound on `RMDIR`; `remove_dir_all` needed no verb once nested paths resolved |
| 14 | `fs::hard_link` | `Unsupported` | 7 | 4 | no verb |
| 15 | `Permissions` | `readonly` is `false` | 7 | 8 | authority is a capability, not a mode bit |
| 16 | `env::temp_dir` | **CLOSED** 2026-08-18 | 11 | 9 | it was a `panic!`, not a refusal; re-counted from 7 |
| 16a | `env::split_paths` | **CLOSED** 2026-08-18 | 8 | 4 | also a `panic!`; no row existed, and no namespace in it |
| 16b | `process::id` | **CLOSED** 2026-08-18 | 5 | 5 | also a `panic!`; `gix-tempfile`'s fork check |
| 17 | `process::Command` | no PAL at all | 6 | 10 | `gix-command`, `gix-credentials` |
| 18 | `env::current_dir` | `Unsupported`, **declined** | 6 | 5 | refuses honestly; it is the namespace question |
| 19 | `Metadata::modified` | `Unsupported` | 5 | 7 | the server keeps an mtime and §43 gave us a clock to read it against, so the only missing piece is a **wire-format change** to `FSTAT`'s reply, which two programs have to agree on and is not a lane's to make |
| 19a | `Path::is_dir` on a directory | was always `false` | (not counted) | | closed with the five above; `create_dir_all` needed it |
| 20 | `fs::set_permissions` | `Unsupported` | 4 | 3 | |
| 21 | `TcpListener` | **CLOSED** 2026-08-18 | 4 | 11 | the LISTEN verb landed at milestone 107; the reason column was stale for a fortnight |

| 23 | `Metadata::created` | `Unsupported` | 3 | 3 | |
| 24 | `set_nonblocking` | `Unsupported` | 3 | 4 | contract is blocking-only |

| 26 | `fs::copy` | **CLOSED** 2026-08-17 | 2 | 2 | needs no verb: an open, a read/write loop, two closes |
| 27 | `fs::canonicalize` | `Unsupported` | 2 | 1 | |
| 28 | `File::set_times` | `Unsupported` | 2 | 1 | same shape as rank 19: no verb sets an mtime, wire-format, wants a decision |

| 30 | `File::lock`/`try_lock` | `Unsupported` | 2 | 1 | `gix-tempfile` |
| 31 | read/write timeouts | `Unsupported` | 1 | 1 | |
| 32 | `Metadata::accessed` | `Unsupported` | 0 | 0 | **nobody asked for it** |

### The second pass, 2026-08-17: what closed, what was declined, and why

Milestone 64's first pass took the five bindings below. The second worked the ranked list from the
top and stopped where the reason to stop was a decision rather than an effort.

**Closed:** rank 1 (`getrandom`, above), rank 4 (`env`), rank 8 (`File::set_len`), rank 26
(`fs::copy`). Rank 9 turned out to need nothing: `fs::symlink_metadata` routes to `sys::fs::lstat`,
which this PAL has bound since milestone 27, so the row was recording a refusal that was not there.

**Rank 4 is the one worth reading, because it is the sting in a second place.** `env::var` was
recorded as "no PAL at all", which sounded like the harmless kind of gap: `getenv` falling through to
`sys::env::unsupported` answers `None`, and `None` is what a Unix box with the variable unset answers
too. But the same fallback's `env()` is `panic!("not supported on this platform")`, so
**`std::env::vars()` aborted the process**, and so did `Command::envs`, a logger dumping its
configuration, anything that filters the environment rather than asking for one name. Like
`tempfile`, it compiled perfectly. Unlike `tempfile`, the fix was ours.

The backend (`patches/std-nife/overlay/std/src/sys/env/nife.rs`) is a **process-local table, empty at
start**: nothing endows a nife process with variables, `set_var` works because that is what `set_var`
means everywhere, and `vars()` returns an empty iterator, which is the one answer here that is never
a lie. Milestone 47's namespace is where a *seeded* environment would come from, and the shape does
not change when it arrives.

**Declined, and each for a reason rather than for time:**

- **Rank 2, `std::os::unix`.** The three crates behind it want a **uid** (`gix-sec`) and a **file
  mtime set** (`filetime`), and this system has neither in the form they ask for. A `std::os::nife`
  that answered `geteuid()` would be inventing an identity nothing issues, and a `MetadataExt` over
  a contract with no mode bits would be a Unix fiction over a capability refusal, which is exactly
  what the `InvalidFilename`-not-`PermissionDenied` choice in `sys/fs/nife.rs` exists to avoid. §42's
  rule is to declare what you offer; the honest answer here is that these crates cannot build, and
  the note's own observation stands: *the distinction between the passes and this class is entirely
  whether the crate author wrote a fallback.*
- **Rank 3, `thread::spawn`.** Not declined on the merits: it is a **design fork** and the roadmap
  block already says so in its own BUGS. The kernel has everything the spawn needs (retype a TCB,
  CONFIGURE it into this address space, START it); what has never been decided is *what a `std`
  thread is* against the budget model, and a PAL that guessed would ship the answer as an
  implementation detail. It also has no build failures behind it at all: all four of `rayon`,
  `crossbeam-channel`, `tokio` and `ignore` compile and link today.
- **Ranks 7, 10, 14, 15, 20, 23, 29 and 30** (`read_link`, `std::os::fd`, `hard_link`, `Permissions`,
  `set_permissions`, `Metadata::created`, `File::try_clone`, `File::lock`). Each refuses because
  nothing in §27 backs it, and inventing a backing is the failure mode. `try_lock` is the one that
  will hurt: `gix-tempfile` wants it.
- **Rank 19, `Metadata::modified`.** The nearest miss on the list. The FS server keeps an mtime and
  §43 gave us a clock to read it against, so the only missing piece is a **field in `FSTAT`'s
  reply**, which makes it a wire-format change, the expensive and irreversible kind, and not a
  lane's to make. It wants a `DECISIONS` section and calef.
- **Rank 28, `File::set_times`, is the same shape as rank 19 and was never named as a decision by an
  earlier pass** (found on milestone 64's next lane, 2026-08-22, while checking the list for anything
  still genuinely buildable). Setting an mtime needs a verb no less than reading one does; there is
  no `SET_TIME` (or equivalent) in `fs_proto`'s verb table today. It is a second wire-format row
  behind the same open decision, not a second question.
- **Ranks 16, 18 and 27** (`env::temp_dir`, `env::current_dir`, `fs::canonicalize`) and everything
  else that needs to resolve a path against something. These are the `File::open` resolution fork,
  which the roadmap block reserves to be answered jointly with milestone 47's namespace half rather
  than twice. Nothing here routed around it.
- **`remove_dir_all`** keeps the existing refusal rather than gaining a recursion. `readdir` shows a
  PAL *can* hold a capability per level, so the mechanism is not the obstacle; the recorded reasoning
  (the loop belongs where each step can be checked against that level's capability, in `user/src/rm.rs`)
  is a decision this lane had no evidence to overturn.

### The third pass, 2026-08-18: the gap list cannot see a `panic!`

The second pass worked the ranked list from the top. The third asked a different question, because
the second pass's own best finding had come from asking it by accident: **what do the neighbouring
functions do?** `env::var` answered `None` honestly while `env::vars()` in the same fallback was a
`panic!`, and only one of the two was on this list.

Run against every module nife falls through rather than binds, that question found three more, and
every one of them **kills the program**:

| call | what it actually was | probes | packages |
|---|---|---|---|
| `std::env::temp_dir()` | `panic!("no filesystem on this platform")` | 11 | 9 |
| `std::env::split_paths()` | `panic!("unsupported")` | 8 | 4 |
| `std::process::id()` | `panic!("no pids on this platform")` | 5 | 5 |

**None of them could ever have appeared on the ranked list**, and that is the finding rather than
the three functions. This list is built from PAL functions that answer `Unsupported`; a function
that aborts never answers anything, so it is invisible to the method that produced every other row
here. `env::temp_dir` did have a row, at rank 16, and it read *"no PAL at all ... needs a namespace
answer, not a PAL one"*, which is how a fatal defect got filed as a design question. Its demand was
also undercounted by four probes.

**What closed, and each stops where the signature stops.** The rule the third pass followed, stated
so the next lane can apply it rather than re-derive it: **fix the ones that abort, leave the ones
that refuse.**

- **`env::temp_dir`** (`patches/std-nife/overlay/std/src/sys/paths/nife.rs`) answers `TMPDIR` if the
  program set one, otherwise `.`. `PathBuf` has no error channel, so *something* had to be named,
  and `.` is not a new decision: `sys/fs/nife.rs`'s `one_name` already says *"./motd is motd: the
  current directory IS the granted one."* A process holds one directory and that is the only place a
  temporary file can go. `/tmp` lost because it names a filesystem root this system does not have,
  so every path built on it would be refused with `InvalidFilename`, turning an abort into a
  guaranteed failure rather than into working code. `TMPDIR` is first for parity and because it is
  the seam milestone 47's namespace arrives through, with no change to the file.
- **`env::split_paths` and `env::join_paths`** are pure string work over a separator with no
  platform in them at all, which is what makes the old `panic!` indefensible rather than merely
  unimplemented. Round-tripped in `std_exerciser`, because a splitter that agrees with nothing is
  worth less than no splitter.
- **`process::id`** (`sys/process/nife.rs`) answers `0`. There is no process identifier on this
  system to report, the four-call syscall surface issues none, and `u32` cannot say so; `0` is the
  one number no Unix assigns to a user process. **The call sites make that the right answer rather
  than the least wrong one:** every reachable use in these fifty closures is a *fork* check
  (`gix-tempfile`'s `forksafe.rs` and its registry compare an owning pid so cleanup runs only in the
  creating process), nife has no `fork`, and a constant is what makes the comparison match.

**Declined, and the line is the same one:** `current_dir`, `current_exe`, `chdir` and `home_dir` all
*can* refuse in their own signatures and do. Each needs a namespace to resolve against, which is
milestone 47's unbuilt half and the `File::open` fork this milestone reserves. `std_exerciser` now
asserts those refusals as well as the two answers, so a later lane cannot quietly turn one into a
fabrication.

Nothing about the fifty-crate split moved: all three were runtime behaviour, and every probe that
built before builds now.

### The fourth pass, 2026-08-18: the reading became a check, and it found a fifth

The third pass ended by saying its method was *"a sweep somebody has to run rather than a gate, and
nothing in the tree runs it."* The fourth built the gate, and the gate immediately found something
the sweep could not have.

**`std::process::exit()` was a trap instruction.** `sys/exit.rs`'s `_ =>` arm is
`crate::intrinsics::abort()`, so a nife program calling `std::process::exit(0)` compiled perfectly
and then executed `brk`; the kernel takes that as a fault, prints it, and reports `EVENT_FAULT` to
the process's supervisor. **A clean exit arrived as a crash**, which is how almost every CLI-shaped
program ends.

**Why the third pass's method could not reach it, and this is the finding rather than the function.**
That method was "read every module the PAL falls through and ask what its neighbours do". It works
on `sys/<module>/mod.rs` dispatchers, which is what `env`, `paths` and `process` are. `sys/exit.rs`
is not one: it is a single file whose `cfg_select!` lives *inside* `pub fn exit`, so there is no
module to read and no neighbours to compare. Two passes of careful reading walked past it, and a
third would have too.

It also hid behind a second thing worth recording: **the two ways a Rust program ends took different
exits, and only one was wired.** Returning from `main` reaches `_start`, which calls the PAL's
`rt::exit` directly; `std::process::exit` is the *only* caller of `sys::exit::exit` anywhere in std.
Every std test in this tree ended the first way, so the broken path never ran.

**The check is `cargo xtask std-aborts`** (provisional name), documented with its worked examples and
its limits in notes/std.md. It asks cargo's own dep-info which `library/std/src/sys/**` sources
rustc compiled for the nife targets and greps exactly those for process-ending bodies, comparing the
result against a list that carries a reason per entry. It is rung two of AGENTS.md's ladder where
this note's BUGS section had rung four, and it runs inside `script/test`.

Nothing about the fifty-crate split moved: this was runtime behaviour, and every probe that built
before builds now. What moved is the count of process-ending calls that a green build hides, which
is now zero as far as a mechanism can see, and the mechanism's own blind spot is written down.

### Five of these were bindings, not verbs, and milestone 64 bound them

Ranks 5, 11, 12, 13 and 25 (`create_dir`, `read_dir`, `remove_file`, `remove_dir`, `rename`) were
each backed by a verb the FS server **already implemented**: `redoxfs_server/src/bin/redoxfs_server.rs` has
dispatched `MKDIR`, `OPENDIR`, `READDIR`, `UNLINK`, `RMDIR` and `RENAME` since milestones 47 and 48.
Nothing was missing from the contract and nothing was missing from the server; the client side in
`patches/std-nife/overlay/std/src/sys/fs/nife.rs` simply still refused, and its own comments
still said the verbs did not exist.

**All five are bound now**, and the `std_exerciser` demo walks them under a real directory
capability on both ISAs. See notes/std.md for the behaviours (what `read_dir(".")` means with no
global namespace, why the listing is drained rather than streamed, and why `remove_file` refuses a
directory).

**A sixth came with them and is not in the table above**, because the census had no row for it:
`Path::is_dir()` was `false` for every directory that exists, since `OPEN` refuses a directory and
`stat` propagated the refusal. That made `std::fs::create_dir_all` non-idempotent, which is the
call every crate reaches for rather than `create_dir`. It costs no extra message: the `EISDIR` the
server already sends *is* the answer. Nothing in a gap list built from `Unsupported` counts would
have found it, because `stat` never returned `Unsupported`; it returned the wrong thing.

Milestone 47's block had already said this for `rename`, `unlink` and `rmdir` ("now a binding gap
rather than a missing verb"). The measurement added two, `read_dir` and `create_dir`, and put
`create_dir` above all of them by demand.

**A refusal outlived its reason by two milestones and nothing caught it**, which is the finding
worth more than the five functions. A refusal that looks correct reads exactly like a refusal that
is correct, and the comment explaining it is written once and then believed. The thing that found it
was not a review; it was asking fifty crates what they wanted.

**And binding them turned up a bug that only a narrowed capability would have shown.** `OPENDIR` and
`MKDIR` take the rights the caller wants on the child in the request's second word, and the server
answers `EPERM` if the intersection with the parent's rights comes up **short of what was asked**
(§47's monotonicity is the intersection; the refusal is the server telling the truth about it). The
first version of this binding asked for `dir::ALL`, which works perfectly through the full-rights
grant every test uses and fails through every narrowed one. A PAL cannot know what its own
capability carries, so it has to ask for the minimum the operation needs: `ENUMERATE` for a listing,
and nothing at all for `create_dir`, which closes the handle it gets back. Caught by reading the
server rather than by a test, and there is still no test that would catch it (a std program spawned
with a narrowed directory capability does not exist yet; that wants a lane).

## BUGS

- **The runtime half is still not measured, for somebody else's crate.** Everything in the tables
  here is compile and link; no probe has ever been booted, so no line in them is evidence that a
  *crate* works, and `tempfile` is proof that the distinction is real rather than pedantic.
  What the second pass added is runtime evidence for **the PAL surfaces it closed** (`env`,
  `set_len`, `copy` are asserted by `std_exerciser` under a real directory capability on both ISAs),
  which is a different claim. Booting a crates.io crate under a stated endowment remains the missing
  half and the milestone's own acceptance criterion. It needs a crates.io dependency in a program
  this tree builds, which is a §46 decision rather than a lane's.
- **A gap list built from `Unsupported` counts cannot see a `panic!`**, and this note went two
  passes without noticing. Three std calls aborted a nife process while compiling perfectly
  (`env::vars`, then `env::temp_dir`, `env::split_paths` and `process::id`), and the ranked list
  below could not have contained any of them, because a function that aborts never returns the
  refusal the census greps for. The method that found them is not a list at all: read every module
  the PAL falls through instead of binding, and read what its *neighbours* do.

  **This is now a gate, `cargo xtask std-aborts`** (milestone 64's fourth pass), and building it
  found a fifth that the reading could not have: `std::process::exit` was `intrinsics::abort()`,
  in a file that is not a module dispatcher at all. The gate's own blind spot is that it covers
  `sys/` only; see notes/std.md, "What still ends a nife process", for why that boundary and what
  it costs.
- **The census counts call sites, not reachable calls.** A `fs::read_dir` inside a `#[cfg(windows)]`
  block counts. The over-count is roughly uniform across rows, so the *ordering* is trustworthy and
  the absolute numbers are not. The precise version (make each `unsupported()` a distinct undefined
  symbol and let the linker report reachability) needs a farm rebuild per probe and was not worth it
  to reorder a list that would not reorder.
- **`fs::rename` is undercounted, badly.** It sits at rank 25 with two probes, and gitoxide renames
  constantly; it just does it through `tempfile::persist` rather than by naming `fs::rename`. Any
  row here can be wrong in the same direction whenever a crate wraps the call. Treat the ranks as a
  starting order, not a budget.
- **Fifty crates is not crates.io.** They were chosen to span categories and to include milestone
  99's and 66's own leaves, which is a deliberate bias toward the things this project is about to
  need. A random sample would look different and would be less useful.
- **Feature flags change the answer.** `flate2` was probed with `rust_backend`; its default C
  backend would land in class C. `mio` was probed with no features and passes; with any it does not.
  `clap` was probed with `std` only. Where a crate has a pure-Rust option, the probe took it, and
  that is a choice this note is making on the reader's behalf.
- **One version of one nightly.** The pinned toolchain of 2026-08-04 and the crate versions resolved
  that day. `getrandom` in particular is mid-transition across 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 in one dependency
  graph.

## What this says about milestone 99 (gitoxide) and milestone 66 (Vaultwarden)

**Milestone 99's decision holds, and the measurement strengthens it.** The block says gitoxide's
gaps "are this project's own roadmap rather than a compatibility project". That is what was found:
`gix`'s blockers are a `getrandom` backend, `gix-sec`'s uid lookup, and `tempfile`'s persist, plus
the five fs bindings above. Every one of them is either PAL surface this tree wants anyway or a
small patch under `patches/`. Nothing in gitoxide's tree wants `fork`, and nothing wants a C library.

Three things the block does not currently say, which the measurement adds:

1. **`getrandom` is the first task, not an incidental.** Nothing in `gix` builds without it.
2. **`tempfile` is the second**, and it is invisible to a build-failure list. `gix-lock` cannot
   commit a ref until `tempfile::persist` works, which means `fs::rename` matters far more than its
   rank-25 position says.
3. **`gix-command` and `gix-credentials` call `process::Command`**, for which there is no PAL at
   all. Whether the staged `git init`/`commit`/`log` path reaches them is unknown; if it does, it is
   a design fork (this kernel spawns by capability) rather than a porting task, exactly as the block
   says for C git.

**Milestone 66 is further away than milestone 99, and the measurement says by how much.** Rocket
fails at `socket2` before any Vaultwarden code is reached, `diesel` needs `libsqlite3`, and `ring`
needs a C toolchain for this target. Those are three separate subsystems (a readiness IO model, the
C seam at library scale, and a socket contract with `listen`/`accept`), and none of them is a `std`
gap that widening the PAL would close.
