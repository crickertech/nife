# The `script/` entry points

Every command you need to work on this repo lives in `script/`, one short file each, with the
same names GitHub's [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all)
pattern uses. The whole idea is muscle memory: clone any repo that follows the pattern, run
`script/setup`, then `script/test`, and you are working. You do not have to learn that this one
uses `cargo xtask` and that one uses `make` and the next uses `npm`.

## The commands

| script | what it does |
|---|---|
| `script/bootstrap` | Install every dependency: the pinned Rust toolchain (via rustup, from `rust-toolchain.toml`) and QEMU. Idempotent: it checks first and installs only what is missing. |
| `script/setup` | First run after a clone: `bootstrap`, then build. |
| `script/update` | After pulling new code: `bootstrap` (the pinned toolchain can change), then rebuild. |
| `script/decisions` | Index `design/decisions/`; `--check` enforces the numbering, the status vocabulary, that each decision's Status line agrees with its index row, and that every `§N` cited anywhere in the tree resolves. Gated in `script/lint`. |
| `script/test` | Host-logic crates, then the kernel under QEMU on **both** ISAs. The gate. |
| `script/verify` | The machine-checked proofs (Kani) over the pure-logic crates. Not in `bootstrap`: Kani pulls its own toolchain and a CBMC backend, so it is installed only where it is used. |
| `script/bench` | icount microbenchmarks; `--check` fails on >10% drift from `bench/baseline-aarch64.txt`, `--save` rewrites it, `--real` runs under HVF for magnitudes, `--extra-features <name>` (with `--real` only) builds an extra kernel feature alongside `bench` (E3's padded-fastpath latency comparison, milestone 134). |
| `script/icount` | The instruction-count instrument (milestone 78): boots a `--features icount` kernel under `-icount shift=0,sleep=off` on both ISAs and asserts the two timing claims a wall clock cannot make, because a slow handler and a descheduled emulator look identical from inside the guest. `--arch` narrows it to one leg. Not in `test` or `gates`; see notes/instruction-clock.md for why, and CI runs it beside `bench --check`. |
| `script/roadmap` | Index the milestones; `--check` validates the status vocabulary and catches a block with no row, or a milestone cited in prose the table does not carry. Gated in `lint`. |
| `script/journeys` | A third instance of `script/roadmap`/`script/decisions`'s pattern, one level up: reports progress against the end-to-end user journeys in `design/journeys/`, computed fresh every run from the roadmap and decisions indices rather than hand-maintained (`design/journeys/README.md` explains why). No arguments lists every journey with a one-line rollup; a journey's slug prints its full step-by-step detail; `--check` validates that every cited milestone and decision resolves. Not yet gated in `lint`, since a journey's steps are a human's editorial claim about what a story needs, not a fact `--check` can be wrong about the way `script/roadmap`'s row-link check can. |
| `script/citations` | The third citation gate, and the only one that reads the target: a `§N (gloss)` or `milestone N (gloss)` must match that record's own title or quote its body, and an attributed block quote must still exist in the file it names. The other two prove a citation resolves to *some* entry; this proves it resolves to the right one. `--check` gates it in `lint`. See notes/citations.md. |
| `script/catch-up [<since>]` | What changed since you last looked: milestone status transitions, milestones newly minted, decisions landed or revised, what is waiting on calef, what is ready to start, and the notes that carry the why. `<since>` is a date (`2026-08-01`) or any git rev; the default is seven days, which is a trip. A **derived view**, never a maintained one, for the reason `notes/session-handoff.md` demonstrates: a hand-written "current state" document rots, and this one is recomputed from the roadmap, the decisions and git every time it runs. Reports what it could not read and why, since the structures it reads are young enough that an old window genuinely cannot be answered in full. |
| `script/apropos <word>` | **Search every document in this repository and say where each one lives** (milestone 40): 512 pages and five megabytes, every note, decision, roadmap block and repository-root document, plus every crate's and program's own module header. It is the guest's `apropos` builtin pointed at a checkout instead of at the six pages the filesystem image installs, and it is deliberately the **same** index and the same reader (`manual::index::build`, `manual::index::search`), so a defect in the layout shows up in both places. What differs is what a result names: at the nife prompt it names a page in the store you can open there, and here it names a path in this repository. It exists because of milestone 117's finding rather than for tidiness: three strangers reached neither `notes/net.md` nor `notes/capabilities.md` nor any `design/decisions/` file by following the tree, and none found `crates/abi/src/lib.rs`. Whole words only, no stemming, sixteen results, ranked by occurrence count; the header of the script carries the rest of its `BUGS`. **The name is provisional.** See [manual.md](manual.md). |
| `script/names` | Who named this, when, and what was refused. Reads the `Name:` block every crate, program and `script/` entry point carries in its own header, so the table is computed rather than maintained. Each block is `ratified` (calef ruled), `recorded` (the tree argues the name and cites where, but nobody put it to him) or `unrecorded` (nothing says why). `--unratified` is the worklist, the last two states ordered by exposure: programs, then crates, then `script/`, and within a tier the unrecorded first. `--refused` lists every refused name and what holds the refusal, which is the query a proposer makes; `--unrecorded` is the narrower slice where research is still owed; `<name>` answers for one name, from the refusals as well as from the tree; `--check` fails the build on a name with no block and **never on a name that is merely unratified**, and is gated in `lint`. **The name of this script is provisional**, as is `--unratified`. See [naming.md](naming.md). |
| `script/rule-violations` | The violation ledger (milestone 118): totals the strikes recorded in `notes/rule-violations.md` against each documented rule and reports which have reached three. Cannot see a violation happen; it only totals what a table says somebody reported. `--check` fails (non-zero) when an `open` rule reaches the threshold, naming what to do (move the rule up the ladder, or mark it `resolved`) and whose call that is (calef's or the integrator's, never a lane's). **Not wired into `script/lint` or CI**: doing so today would fail the shared gate over an already-crossed threshold that is not a lane's decision to resolve. **Name provisional.** See [rule-violations.md](rule-violations.md). |
| `script/audits` | Is an audit due? Reads `design/audit-reports/README.md` and counts the tree: milestones built, components, the `crates/abi` constant surface, and the external packages in every committed lockfile. §74's triggers are in the index rather than in the script, so milestone 93 adds documentation sweeps by adding a row. `--due` is the tripwire and exits non-zero when one is overdue, in its own weekly workflow so a due audit never blocks a merge; `--check` is the structural half (the index's two tables agree, every report resolves, every finding carries a disposition) and is gated in `lint`; `--baseline` prints the counts for a new row; `--worklist` ranks documents by how much of the code they cite has moved since they were last edited, which is how a documentation sweep picks its scope (milestone 93, a heuristic with no exit status rather than a signal). It never runs an audit: **red means run the audit**, not "an automation ran it for you". **Name provisional.** See [design/audit-reports/README.md](../design/audit-reports/README.md) and [documentation-audit.md](documentation-audit.md). |
| `script/stranger-test` | Hand this repository to a process that has never seen it, and record what it could not work out (milestone 117). Clones at a commit **inside** the stranger's working directory rather than as it, which is the whole isolation: project instructions load from ancestors and never from descendants, so no `AGENTS.md` arrives at turn zero while the file is still in its tree to be opened. Withholds the answer key, keeps its own artifacts in a sibling directory with no run number in any path element, scopes `pkill` and `killall` to this clone's QEMU, **probes the isolation rather than assuming it**, tells the stranger it is being measured, debriefs it, and puts the account-wide `nife-dev` link back where it found it. `--prepare-only` builds the tree and stops; `--smoke` exercises the pipeline with a trivial task and is not a measurement. **The run is never in CI and never can be**: it spawns a `claude` process, spends real budget, needs the toolchain and both QEMUs, and ends in a debrief a person scores. What is in CI is the cadence, calef's monthly decision of 2026-08-18 made mechanical: `--due` exits non-zero when a run is owed and lives in its own weekly workflow so a due run never blocks a merge, and `--check` (the cadence sentence appears once, the run headings are numbered without a gap and in date order) is gated in `lint`. Both read the interval and the last run's date out of the note, so the schedule and the record cannot disagree; neither runs the test, and **red means run it**. **Name provisional.** See [stranger-test.md](stranger-test.md). |
| `script/initboot` | Boot straight into userspace init, skipping the milestone tour. |
| `script/board-console` | Read a real board's serial console (milestone 216): open the port at 115200 8N1, log every byte to a file, recognise how far the boot got from the markers `notes/visionfive2.md`'s runbook records, and stop on a deadline. A different exit status for each way a session ends, so a bench script can tell a hang from a refusal. Reads and never writes; does not touch power. **Name provisional.** See notes/board-console.md. |
| `script/board-image` | Build the VisionFive 2 microSD payload (milestone 16a): the riscv64 kernel as a flat Image (the RISC-V boot header verified at offset 0x38), an `extlinux.conf`, and the printed copy commands. It writes under `target/board/` and runs nothing destructive; putting bytes on a card is the bench's decision. **Name provisional.** See notes/visionfive2.md. |
| `script/qemu-check` | Is the QEMU on PATH the one `.qemu-version` pins, and does it carry the devices the suite needs? **Fails** on a missing device (that would gut a test silently), **warns** on a version mismatch (Homebrew cannot install an arbitrary older QEMU, and an unfollowable rule is worse than none). Called by `bootstrap` and by `ci-qemu`. |
| `script/ci-qemu` | CI only, Linux only: build the pinned QEMU into a cacheable prefix, because Ubuntu 24.04's 8.2 has no `riscv-iommu-pci` and apt cannot go newer. |
| `script/drift [nightly-YYYY-MM-DD]` | Does a toolchain still build us? Bare-metal build plus the host-logic tests. With no argument it checks the pin, which makes it a fast health check; given a nightly it checks that one, which is what the daily `toolchain drift` workflow does with the newest. |
| `script/toolchain-bump [YYYY-MM-DD]` | Raise the pinned nightly, with evidence: install, rebuild the std farm from scratch, run every gate. Restores the old pin if anything fails, because a half-applied toolchain bump is worse than none. Run it when the daily `toolchain drift` workflow goes red. |
| `script/test` | Run the suite: the host-logic crates in milliseconds, then the kernel under QEMU. The fast inner loop; assumes `setup` has run. `--arch aarch64\|riscv64` runs one ISA leg instead of both (the default is still both, so the parity gate cannot be weakened by forgetting it); `--cpu <model>` picks the emulated CPU (notes/cpu-models.md); `--hvf` runs the aarch64 kernel leg on the physical Apple Silicon core instead of under TCG (aarch64 only, `-cpu host` mandatory, and it skips the host-logic crates because no accelerator exists on that path; notes/hvf-leg.md); `--test <substring>` runs only the kernel tests whose path contains it (milestone 210, see below). |
| `script/cpu-matrix` | Run the riscv64 suite against every QEMU CPU model in the matrix (`rv64`, `sifive-u54`, `rva22s64`, `rva23s64`, `thead-c906`), because the default `rv64` is QEMU's maximalist model and the board is an RV64GC U74. A CI gate. Preflights that `-cpu` is enforced rather than merely advertised, then runs every model without stopping at the first failure. See notes/cpu-models.md. |
| `script/repeat-under-load [-n runs] [-s spinners] [-- <script/test args>]` | Run the suite N times with one busy-loop spinner per core, and record what the load actually was: elapsed seconds per run, the one-minute load average sampled every ten seconds (minimum, mean, peak), and how many QEMU processes were up, so a neighbouring lane gating on the same laptop is separable from the contention the script manufactures. Milestone 62's acceptance instrument, and the answer to that block's own BUGS line: a flake that fires one run in six is indistinguishable from a fixed one until you have run it many times, so the evidence is a repeat count under load rather than a green run. **Load causes false failures, not false passes**, which is what makes a green result here conclusive and a red one a lead; the failure text says so, and says not to widen the bound. `-s 0` is the quiet control. Not a gate and never in CI: it costs hours by construction. **Name provisional.** See notes/load-sensitive-assertions.md. |
| `script/runner-container [-n runs] [--arch A] [--build-only] [--shell]` | Boot the suite over and over inside an approximation of the CI runner, because `inbound check (riscv64)` has gone red three times on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` and never once on macOS. An ubuntu 24.04 aarch64 container, running **native** on an aarch64 laptop so nothing is emulated but the guest, with the emulator built by `script/ci-qemu` from `.qemu-version`'s pin rather than apt-installed, provisioning by `script/bootstrap`, and the core count narrowed by affinity rather than by a CFS quota (a quota throttles without changing what `nproc` says, which is not the runner's shape). The loop is `script/repeat-under-load -s 0`: no induced load, because both CI observations had a load average near 1 and spinners would be manufacturing a different bug. The tree is mounted **read-only** and cloned inside, so a fifty-boot run cannot write into a lane's worktree and cannot take the account-global `nife-dev` link; QEMU cannot leak, because the emulators die with the container. Not a gate and never in CI. **Name provisional.** See notes/net.md's inbound BUGS section for what fifty boots found and what the container does not carry. |
| `script/ci-build` | What CI runs: `bootstrap` (a CI runner starts bare), then the tests. |
| `script/soak` | Run milestone 219's sustained multicore workload under QEMU and judge it exactly as a board is judged: boot `--features soak`, where the tour ends in a pool of user-mode IPC workers and a five-second heartbeat instead of `arch::halt()`, and feed the console to the same `board_console` recogniser and policy `script/board-console` points at a real port. Same exit statuses (0 beat throughout, 1 announced a failure, 2 went quiet, 3 QEMU exited early or the workload never started, 4 build or arguments). `--arch aarch64|riscv64|x86_64`, `--for <duration>`, `--smp <n>`. **A clean run is a number to compare against, not evidence that the concurrency is correct**, and the script says so on every green run. **Name provisional.** See notes/soak.md. |
| `script/server` | Boot the OS in QEMU (the milestone tour, then the shell). An OS is the thing you *start*, so it is `server`. |
| `script/console` | Boot straight to the interactive shell at EL0. For this project the console is literally a shell running as an unprivileged process. |
| `script/shell-check` | `console`'s gating twin: boot `--features shell` on both ISAs, type eleven lines at the prompt, and check what came back (the pipe and both redirection operators, `wc gate.txt` against `wc < gate.txt`, and the wall clock). The only thing in the tree that runs a **real** init (`system_initializer` on riscv64, `hello`'s `init_boot` role on aarch64, both of which are `crates/system_initializer` since milestone 96); every other shell test has the kernel play init. Not in `script/test`, because it builds a second kernel and boots it twice. `--arch aarch64\|riscv64` for one leg. |
| `script/fmt` | Format the tree with the pinned rustfmt; `--check` reports instead of writing (the CI gate). |
| `script/gates` | Run every gate a pull request must pass, cheapest first: `script/fmt --check`, `script/lint`, `script/test`, then (milestone 81) `script/test --hvf`, the aarch64 suite again on the physical Apple Silicon core. One command instead of three, because on 2026-08-03 a change was pushed having run two of them and the third failed in CI. The HVF leg lives here rather than in a workflow because GitHub's hosted macOS arm64 runners are VMs without nested virtualization, so HVF does not exist there; when the host cannot supply it the leg **skips loudly**, naming the reason and saying that nothing in the run touched a physical core, so a Linux transcript cannot be read as silicon coverage. It costs about 16 s (measured; notes/hvf-leg.md). Deliberately NOT the whole CI surface: Kani, the CPU matrix, fuzzing, coverage, the bench tripwire and the supply-chain audit stay in CI, since a wrapper that took an hour is one nobody would run. Never writes; use `script/fmt` to format. |
| `script/lint` | Run clippy across the workspace with warnings denied (a CI gate), on both ISAs and in each boot-mode feature build, plus the non-clippy checks that share its job: broken intra-doc links, conflict markers, the roadmap status vocabulary, relative markdown links plus the notes/README.md index, DECISIONS numbering, that every `script/` has an entry here, that no file carries a module-wide `#![allow(dead_code)]` (DECISIONS §38), and the naming conventions a machine can check (no `-d` names, none of the rejected Unix vocabulary, one spelling for contract crates, a recognised branch prefix; notes/naming.md). Milestone 68 added three more: **dependency direction** (nothing under `crates/` may depend on a binary, which would still build while leaving the host tests and Kani), **unused dependencies** via `cargo-machete` (DECISIONS §46), and **spelling** via `typos`. Milestone 94 added one more: a **`TODO`/`FIXME` marker in code names the milestone that owns it** (`TODO(milestone N):`, and the block has to exist), because a marker with no home is identified work resting where nobody will look for it. Markdown is exempt, since prose explaining the convention has to spell the shape it forbids, and a note may quote a marker that was resolved milestones ago. Milestone 113 added a fourteenth clippy configuration: the **proof harnesses**, compiled with `--cfg kani` against the shim in `scripts/kani-lint-shim/`, because `cfg(kani)` is set by the model checker and by nothing else and so those modules had never been linted at all (26 warnings on the first run; notes/unsafe-obligations.md). Lint SELECTION is not here: it lives in `Cargo.toml`'s `[workspace.lints]`, with `clippy.toml` and `_typos.toml` holding the two allowlists. See DECISIONS §61 for why three candidate lints were measured and dropped. |
| `script/coverage` | Coverage for the host-logic crates, gated on an 80%-per-file line floor (a CI gate). Installs cargo-llvm-cov on first run. |
| `script/vendor-verify` | Prove each `vendor/*.pin` tree is the published tarball (sha256) plus exactly its divergence patch, byte for byte. `--write-patch` regenerates the patch after a deliberate change. Needs network on a cold cache. |
| `script/vendor-watch` | Ask what upstream has done since each `vendor/*.pin` was taken: newer crates.io releases, and upstream git commits since the pinned sha, merge commits dropped. **Both**, because releases here are months apart and a correctness fix can sit on master long before it is published. `--write` regenerates `vendor/upstream-status.md` and raises the pin when a newer release exists, which makes `vendor-verify` fail and turns the upgrade into a visible red check; it deliberately does not try to re-apply the divergence patch. Exit codes are the answer rather than a verdict: 0 current, 1 behind, 2 transiently unreachable, 3 permanently unreachable (a 404, meaning the watch itself is broken). The monthly `vendor watch` workflow runs it and opens one pull request on a fixed branch. Needs network. Name **provisional**. |
| `script/supply-chain` | The milestone-42 gate (a CI gate): cargo-deny (advisories, licences, bans, duplicates, sources) over each workspace against `deny.toml`, then `vendor-verify`. Needs network; installs the cargo-deny pinned in `.cargo-deny-version` if the installed one differs, because 0.19 and 0.20 spell `--config` differently and default it to different directories. |
| `script/fuzz` | Coverage-guided fuzzing (cargo-fuzz/libFuzzer) over the parsers that read bytes we did not write: `dtb_walk`, `elf_parse`, `gpt_table`, `nifefs_roundtrip` (a CI gate). `--time N` sets the per-target budget (default 60s, `0` runs until stopped), `--list` explains each target, and a bare target name runs one. Installs the cargo-fuzz pinned in `.cargo-fuzz-version` on absence or mismatch. See notes/fuzzing.md. |
| `script/undefined-behavior-check` | The host-logic tests again, under Miri's interpreter: aliasing, pointer provenance, uninitialized reads, leaks, the rules no other gate checks. Weekly in CI plus on demand; not in `test` or `gates`, because the interpreter is minutes where the host tests are milliseconds. The exhaustive suites sample themselves under `cfg(miri)`, so "Miri-clean" means the sampled paths. Extra args go to `cargo miri test` (`script/undefined-behavior-check -p gpt`). See notes/undefined-behavior.md. |
| `script/interleaving-check` | The hand-rolled atomic protocols under loom, which searches **every** thread interleaving and every reordering the C11 model permits (milestone 80). The one gate that can falsify CLAUDE.md's fourth rule: Kani's harnesses are single-threaded, Miri runs one interleaving, and QEMU's TCG explores almost none of the orderings aarch64 and riscv64 allow. Covers `crates/steal_request` (the work-steal handshake) and `crates/clock_proto` (the clock page's seqlock, where it found a real torn read on its first run). `loom` is a `[target.'cfg(loom)'.dependencies]` entry, so no ordinary build resolves or compiles it. Under a second warm; extra args go to `cargo test`. Not in `test` or `gates`; see the note for why. See notes/interleaving.md. |
| `script/stack-frame-check` | What one kernel function's stack frame costs, from `-Z emit-stack-sizes`, gated at **4096 bytes, the guard page** (this row said "a third of the smallest kernel stack, 5461 bytes" until 2026-08-16, and that was the ceiling the gate shipped with for one day before its own header corrected it: a frame larger than the guard page can step clean over it, so the guard page is the number and any fraction of the stack is not). The complement of milestone 84's watermark: that says how deep the suite *went* and cannot say which function is expensive, which is the question an overflow poses. Written after `sched::reap_region_objects` carried a 6816-byte frame, of which 4096 was one `[u64; MAX_ENDPOINTS]` scratch array, against 4712 bytes of measured headroom; it compiled without a warning and was found only because a milestone's CI faulted one run in five. Gates both ISAs (§19). `--arch` narrows, `--report` prints the deepest 40 and gates nothing. Needs no emulator, so it works from a machine with no QEMU. A CI job, not in `gates`: it builds the kernel test binary twice, which is more than `gates` promises. See notes/stack-high-water.md. |
| `script/stack-depth-check` | How deep a kernel **thread stack** can get, by walking the call graph: direct calls out of the disassembly, `-Z emit-stack-sizes` frames hung on the resulting graph, longest path from the entry points a thread stack starts at (`thread_entry`, `user_thread_entry`, the arch trap dispatcher). The third instrument, and the one both older notes named as the gap without building: a frame size is not a chain and a watermark sees only what the suite ran. It also checks the claim `stack-frame-check`'s exception table makes by hand, that a given oversized frame cannot reach a thread stack. Fails when the worst chain does not fit in 24576 bytes (`thread::STACK_PAGES`, which said 16384 here for a day after #225 raised it), when the interrupt-stack chain does not fit 16384, when a context switch is **reachable** from the interrupt-stack entry point, or when any frame over the guard page is reachable; warns past 18432, the watermark's own thread row. `--arch` narrows, `--report` prints each chain and gates nothing. The switch-reachability check is milestone 124's, and it is the strong half of the rule that nothing on a per-CPU interrupt stack may context-switch away from it: a violation would corrupt a stack rather than fault, so it is checked statically every build instead of waited for. On 2026-08-16, after that milestone, it read 13456 bytes worst case on aarch64 and 13008 on riscv64, of which the handler leaves 3728 and 3552 on the thread and 3984 and 3888 on the interrupt stack. It is a lower bound rather than an upper one: indirect calls and assembly (which carries no `.stack_sizes` entry at all) are invisible to it. Runs in the `stack-frame-check` CI job, sharing its build. Name **provisional**. See notes/stack.md. |
| `script/fastpath-footprint` | An upper bound on the **IPC fastpath's instruction footprint**, which is the quantity Liedtke's *On micro-Kernel Construction* (SOSP 1995) identified as the real cost of Mach's IPC: a kernel that touches a lot of memory per IPC evicts the *application's* working set, so the bill arrives as capacity misses spread through the workload rather than as time in the kernel. Two numbers, because they are two quantities: `ipc_fastpath` is the transitive closure of non-cold calls from the IPC and switch roots, and `syscall_entry` is the trap vector, the exception dispatcher and `syscall::dispatch` summed flat, since one syscall traverses one path through a decoder but the decoder's own bytes are on every syscall. Uses the same disassembly call-graph walk `script/stack-depth-check` does and inherits its blind spot, that indirect calls are invisible. Gated at **5%** growth against `bench/fastpath-<arch>.txt`, tighter than the icount tripwire's 10% because a symbol size moves only when the code moves. Whole symbol sizes, so a cold tail inside a hot function counts and the number is an upper bound. Excludes the teardown family reached through `finish_switch`'s reap branch, which no IPC takes and which put 11.2 KiB on a 5.6 KiB figure before it was excluded. **It is not a cache measurement**: nothing in this tree models a cache yet, so it gates the quantity and not the harm. Both ISAs (§19). `--arch` narrows, `--save` re-records, `--features <name>` builds an extra kernel feature in and reports without gating or saving (E3's footprint-perturbation experiment, milestone 134). A CI job, not in `gates`: it builds two release kernels. See notes/benchmarks.md. |
| `script/image-permissions` | The three shipped kernel images obey W^X: no `PT_LOAD` in `kernel`'s ELF is both writable and executable, on aarch64, riscv64 and x86_64 (§19). Built because `crates/elf` refuses such a segment and `paging::Flags` cannot construct such a page, so W^X was enforced on every ELF this system **loads** and on nothing about the ELF this system **is**; the x86_64 image carried an RWX boot segment from the port until milestone 208, through every other gate in the tree, because nothing had ever parsed it. It reads `p_type` and `p_flags` at the offsets ELF64 fixes rather than calling `Elf::parse`, and the reason is not laziness: that parser binds its accepted `e_machine` at compile time, so a host tool built once can accept exactly one of the three kernels and a gate covering one architecture would fail §19 on the day it was written. It reports every violation rather than the first. `--no-build` checks what is already built. Seconds warm; runs in `script/gates` and in a CI job of its own, though not yet a required one. Name **provisional**. |
| `script/crate-probes` | Build fifty crates.io crates against the patched `std` and report the split (milestone 64's measurement, which milestones 99 and 66 consume through notes/crates-io-on-nife.md). Each probe is a `[[bin]]` whose `main` calls the crate, because a library target is never linked and an unreferenced dependency is compiled and never linked; both rules were learned by recording `diesel` as a pass twice. A probe that fails is rebuilt for the host and reports `BODY` instead of `FAIL` when the host fails too, so a wrong call site in this script cannot be read as a nife result. `--no-backend` drops `entropy_backend`, which is the difference between 43 built and 39. Needs network and takes the account-wide `nife-dev` link, so it is not a CI gate and `script/test` does not run it; aarch64 only, since the PAL speaks the capability ABI rather than an ISA. Name **provisional**. See notes/crates-io-on-nife.md. |
| `script/mutation` | Mutation testing (cargo-mutants) over the host crates: would any test notice if this line were wrong? A report, not a gate; the weekly `mutation testing` workflow runs it four-way sharded and publishes the per-crate table against `.cargo/mutants-baseline.txt`. `--shard k/n` splits the run, `-p CRATE` narrows it, `--report` summarizes finished output, `--save-baseline` rewrites the baseline. Exclusions (with reasons) in `.cargo/mutants.toml`; installs the cargo-mutants pinned in `.cargo-mutants-version` on absence or mismatch. See notes/mutation-testing.md. |
| `script/falsifications` | **Can each Kani harness be made to fail?** `script/mutation` asks that of the tests; this asks it of the proofs, which is not the same question, and DECISIONS §134 is why it is written down rather than remembered. Every harness carries a `Falsification:` block above `#[kani::proof]` in one of three states: `replayable <path>` (a patch at `crates/<crate>/falsifications/<module.path>.<harness_fn_name>.patch`, which is Kani's own fully qualified harness name with the separators changed, so the sweep filters with `--exact`), `attested <date>` (a person watched it fail, and nothing can re-check that), or `unfalsified`. Bare, it prints the table and the ratio; `--unfalsified` is the worklist, `--check` is the form gate `lint` runs (presence of a *state*, never `replayable`, exactly the line `script/names --check` draws), `--sweep [crate...]` applies each patch and requires that one harness to go red, and `--affected-since <base>` sweeps only what a diff can reach. A report weekly (`falsification sweep`), a gate per pull request through `verify.yml`, since a patch a commit staled is a defect in that commit. Refuses to sweep a dirty tree. See notes/falsification.md. |
`fmt`, `lint`, `coverage`, `supply-chain`, `fuzz`, `miri`, and `mutants` are not part of the canonical
set; they exist so the CI format, clippy, coverage, supply-chain, fuzz, miri, and weekly mutation
jobs are one-liners. `coverage` measures only the pure-logic host crates(`abi`, `capability`, `nifefs`, `dtb`, `elf`, `frames`, `paging`, `pci`, ...): the kernel and user
crates run under QEMU, out of reach of host instrumentation, which is the same reason DECISIONS.md
§7 keeps the testable logic in host crates in the first place. It installs its own tool rather than
leaning on `bootstrap`, so the CI test job (which runs `bootstrap`) never compiles a coverage tool
it does not use.

## They are thin wrappers, on purpose

The scripts do almost nothing themselves. `script/test` is `cargo xtask test`; `script/server`
is `cargo xtask run`; `script/console` is `cargo xtask shell`. **`cargo xtask` is still the
engine** and still the place the real build logic lives (and it exposes more than the scripts do:
`gdb`, `objdump`, `image`, `std-aborts`). The scripts add a normalized interface on top, and nothing was
duplicated to get it. If you prefer typing `cargo xtask …`, it all still works.

## Two things that are deliberately the way they are

**`script/` (singular) vs `scripts/` (plural).** The normalized entry points are in `script/`,
GitHub's convention. The older `scripts/` (plural) holds `qemu-runner-aarch64.sh` and `qemu-bounded.sh`,
which are internal plumbing that cargo and the scripts call, not things you run by hand. Two
directories an `s` apart is a little awkward, but each follows its own convention, and keeping the
runner where cargo already expects it (`.cargo/config.toml` points at `scripts/qemu-runner-aarch64.sh`)
was cheaper than moving it.

**One thing in `scripts/` is not internal plumbing, and it is worth naming so the rule above is not
misread.** `scripts/qemu-uefi-x86_64.sh` (milestone 87) boots the x86_64 kernel under OVMF, the real
UEFI firmware, from a staged EFI system partition. It is run by hand as well as by
`cargo xtask uefi-boot`, and it lives beside the runners rather than in `script/` because it is a
QEMU invocation of exactly their kind: it is not a cargo `runner` only because this boot path has no
`-kernel` argument for cargo to pass it. See notes/x86-uefi-boot.md.

**`bootstrap` installs system packages.** Running `script/bootstrap` will `brew install qemu` on
macOS or `apt-get install` on Linux if QEMU is missing. That is the pattern's intent: a fresh
clone should be one command from working, but it is also why `script/test` does *not* call
`bootstrap` every time: re-checking a package manager on every inner-loop test run is a poor
trade. `setup`/`update` do the heavy dependency work; `test` stays fast; `ci-build` provisions
because CI has nothing to start with.

## Counted claims, one of `script/lint`'s checks

Milestone 125 added a check that does not fit the table above, because what it gates is the prose
rather than the code. A number carrying a `<!--count:NAME-->` marker is re-derived from the tree on
every build, and `script/lint` fails on a mismatch, naming both values and the line. Three registry
entries so far (`kani-harnesses`, `harness-crates`, `sh-scripts`); an unmarked number stays
unchecked, which is the ratchet working as designed. See [counted-claims.md](counted-claims.md) for
how to add one, and for the honest limits.

**This section is prose and not a row in that table on purpose**, and the reason is worth knowing
before you edit either. `script/lint`'s row is the longest line in the repository's markdown at
1927 bytes <!--count:longest-markdown-line-->, and `manual`'s renderer sizes `LINE_MAX` at 2048
against exactly that measurement. Extending
that row by a sentence overflows the buffer, and the way you find out is a `manual` render test
failing while pointing at text three hundred lines further down the file.

## CI leverages them

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs seven jobs whose actual work is a script: the test job runs
`script/ci-build`, the format job runs `script/fmt --check`, the clippy job runs `script/lint`, the verify
job runs `script/verify`, the bench job runs `script/bench --check` on both ISAs, the coverage job
runs `script/coverage`, and the supply-chain job runs `script/supply-chain`. So CI executes the same
commands a developer does, and one place (these files) defines what "test", "lint", "verify", and
"supply chain" mean.

## The versioned hooks

`.githooks/` holds hooks the repository owns, wired by `script/setup` with
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. One line rather than copying files into `.git/hooks`,
because that directory is neither versioned nor shared, and a lane's worktree shares the main
checkout's `.git`: setting `core.hooksPath` covers every worktree at once, which is the case
that motivated the first hook.

- **`pre-push`** runs `script/fmt --check` (~0.7 s) and refuses the push if rustfmt would change
  a file, because CI's `rustfmt` is a required check and learning about a wrapped line from a
  runner ten minutes later is the slowest possible way to learn it. Every lane on 2026-08-15 and
  -16 paid that tax at least once. `git push --no-verify` bypasses it, deliberately: pushing a
  work-in-progress branch for safekeeping is a legitimate reason, and the hook is a courtesy to
  the queue rather than a rule about what may exist on a branch.

An existing clone installs it by rerunning `script/setup`, or by hand with the config line above.

### BUGS

- **The hook is opt-in per clone.** A contributor who never runs `script/setup` never has it, and
  nothing detects that; the gate in CI stays the authority, which is the correct direction for
  this to be wrong in.
- **It checks the whole tree, not the pushed range.** Cheap enough at this size that the
  precision is not worth the complexity, and a tree that is unformatted anywhere fails CI anyway.

## Running one kernel test (`script/test --test`)

Milestone 210. A host crate's test is a function a harness calls, so `cargo test <name>` has always
worked there. A kernel test is not: it runs inside a booted kernel under QEMU, the runner is
`kernel/src/testing.rs`'s `runner`, and until this flag existed that runner took no filter at all.
So the only way to see one kernel test was to run all 312 of them.

```
script/test --arch aarch64 --test frames_are_zeroed
```

The substring is matched against the test's full path (`core::any::type_name` of the
`#[test_case]` function), which is the same shape `cargo test <name>` matches, so a module name
selects a module's worth and a full path selects exactly one.

### What it costs, measured

The block that minted this guessed that "the boot is most of the four minutes", which would have
made the flag worth much less than it sounds. It is not. Timed on patagonia, aarch64,
`cargo xtask test --arch aarch64`:

| | |
|---|---|
| QEMU start to `running 312 tests` (objcopy, QEMU, the whole kernel boot) | **0.50 s** |
| the 312 tests themselves | **53.1 s** |
| the whole `--arch aarch64` run, host crates and builds included | **174 s** |
| the same run with `--test <one test>`, warm | **8.6 s** |

So the boot is about **1%** of the QEMU leg, not most of it, and the flag is worth more than the
block expected rather than less. What is left in the 8.6 s is the fixture work `test` does before
any leg (the userspace archive, the `std` exerciser, and five disk images), not the boot.

### How the filter reaches the kernel, and why it is compile-time

`kernel/build.rs` bakes `NIFE_TEST_FILTER` into the test binary as a `rustc-env`, and `runner`
reads it as a `const`. That is not the obvious design (a boot argument is), and the reason is
parity: a runtime channel means the boot protocol, and there are three of them. aarch64 and riscv64
arrive with a device tree whose `/chosen/bootargs` this kernel does not parse; x86_64 arrives
through PVH with no device tree at all. One `env!` is identical on all three and needs no parsing.
The price is a kernel relink, measured at about 2.3 s, when the filter *changes*.

### What the flag turns off, and why

A filtered run is not the suite, so three things that assert what unselected tests would have
written are suppressed rather than allowed to fail for an unrelated reason:

- **the host-logic crates** do not run at all (they already have `cargo test <name>`, and running
  their 72 s to reach one kernel test would keep most of the cost the flag removes);
- **the post-run RedoxFS, crash and blank image checks** are skipped, the same guard `--arch
  x86_64` already has: they would open a stale image from a previous run and report a true fact
  about a leftover file as a false one about this run;
- **the scanout, inbound and multicast referees** still run (the scanout referee is also what
  presses keys over QEMU's monitor, which the keyboard test needs) but their verdicts become
  advisory, and the run says so on a line of its own.

### EXAMPLES

```
$ script/test --arch aarch64 --test the_asid_width_supports_the_allocator
--- test filter: the_asid_width_supports_the_allocator (kernel legs only; the host crates have `cargo test`) ---
--- kernel tests, aarch64 (QEMU) ---

running 1 of 312 tests (filter: the_asid_width_supports_the_allocator)

test kernel::arch::aarch64::isa::tests::the_asid_width_supports_the_allocator ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed
```

A filter that matches nothing fails the run, rather than reporting a green `0 passed`:

```
$ script/test --arch aarch64 --test no_such_test_anywhere
running 0 of 312 tests (filter: no_such_test_anywhere)
no test matches the filter `no_such_test_anywhere`
  (a test only this architecture lacks? `--test` runs every leg; add `--arch`)
```

### BUGS

- **`--test` selects tests, not architectures, and that is deliberate** (DECISIONS §19). A filter
  naming an architecture-specific test and no `--arch` runs all three legs and fails on the two
  that do not have it. Failing is the honest outcome, because the alternative (skipping a leg with
  no matches) makes a typo indistinguishable from a green run; the message names the fix.
- **A filtered run proves nothing about the whole-suite instruments.** The frame ledger's
  kept-frames ceiling, the thread peak and the stack high-water are all totals over 312 tests, so a
  one-test run's readings sit far under them and cannot fail. Read a green filtered run as "this
  test passes", never as "the suite would".
- **Tests are not independent, and running one alone can fail honestly.** A test that only passes
  because an earlier one wired a service will fail on its own. That is a true finding about the
  test rather than a defect in the flag, and it is worth reading as one.
- **The fixture work is not filtered.** The 8.6 s above is almost entirely archive and image
  building that happens whether or not the selected test needs a disk. Filtering that too would
  need `test` to know which fixtures a given test wants, which nothing records.
