# The `script/` entry points

Every command you need to work on this repo lives in `script/`, one short file each, with the
same names GitHub's [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all)
pattern uses. The whole idea is muscle memory: clone any repo that follows the pattern, run
`script/setup`, then `script/test`, and you are working. You do not have to learn that this one
uses `cargo xtask` and that one uses `make` and the next uses `npm`.

## The commands

One table per group. Each links to an appendix holding the full row: flags, gates and history.

### Build, test and gate

Full rows, with every flag and the history behind each: [build-test-and-gate.md](scripts/build-test-and-gate.md).

| script | what it does |
|---|---|
| `script/bootstrap` | Install the pinned toolchain and QEMU. Idempotent. |
| `script/setup` | First run after a clone: `bootstrap`, then build. |
| `script/update` | After a pull: `bootstrap`, then rebuild. |
| `script/claim <branch-name>` | Cut a lane's branch and worktree, and make the draft pull request claim. |
| `script/test` | The suite: host-logic crates, then the kernel under QEMU. The gate. `--arch`, `--cpu`, `--hvf`, `--test` narrow it. |
| `script/verify` | The Kani proofs over the pure-logic crates. |
| `script/bench` | icount microbenchmarks; `--check` fails on drift from the baseline. |
| `script/icount` | Boot a `--features icount` kernel and assert the two timing claims a wall clock cannot make. |
| `script/fmt` | Format with the pinned rustfmt; `--check` is the CI gate. |
| `script/lint` | Clippy on every ISA and feature build, plus the non-clippy checks sharing its job. |
| `script/coverage` | Host-crate coverage, gated at 80% per file. |
| `script/ci-build` | The one list of checks a pull request must pass. CI runs its rows. |
| `script/preflight-queue` | Replay the merge queue locally before a group build does. |
| `script/qemu-check` | Is the QEMU on PATH the pinned one, with the devices the suite needs? |
| `script/ci-qemu` | Build the pinned QEMU on Linux, where apt cannot. |
| `script/drift` | Does a toolchain still build us? |
| `script/toolchain-bump` | Raise the pinned nightly, with every gate as evidence. |
| `script/server` | Boot the OS in QEMU: the milestone tour, then the shell. |
| `script/console` | Boot straight to the interactive shell at EL0. |

### The tree's records and indexes

Full rows, with every flag and the history behind each: [records-and-indexes.md](scripts/records-and-indexes.md).

| script | what it does |
|---|---|
| `script/decisions` | Index `design/decisions/`; `--check` is gated in `lint`. |

| `script/journeys` | Progress against the end-to-end user journeys. |
| `script/citations` | Does each `§N` or `milestone N` gloss match what it cites? `--ratchet` gates added lines. |
| `script/fatal-risks` | Does `design/fatal-risks.md` agree with the records it cites? |
| `script/catch-up` | What changed since you last looked. |
| `script/apropos <word>` | Search every document in the repository. |
| `script/names` | Who named this, when, and what was refused. |
| `script/metrics` | The weekly measures behind `notes/project-metrics.md`. |

| `script/effort` | Machine effort spent per ISO week. |
| `script/stranger-test` | Hand the repository to a fresh process and record what it could not work out. |

### Boards and boot checks

Full rows, with every flag and the history behind each: [boards-and-boot-checks.md](scripts/boards-and-boot-checks.md).

| script | what it does |
|---|---|
| `script/board-console` | Read a real board's serial console and say how far the boot got. |
| `script/board-image` | Build the VisionFive 2 microSD payload. |

|---|---|
| `script/vendor-verify` | Each `vendor/*.pin` tree is the published tarball plus its patch. |
| `script/vendor-watch` | What upstream has done since each pin. |

`fmt`, `lint`, `coverage`, `supply-chain`, `fuzz`, `miri`, and `mutants` are not part of the canonical
set; they exist so the CI format, clippy, coverage, supply-chain, fuzz, miri, and weekly mutation
jobs are one-liners. `coverage` measures only the pure-logic host crates(`abi`, `capability`, `nifefs`, `device_tree_blob`, `elf`, `frames`, `paging`, `pci`, ...): the kernel and user
crates run under QEMU, out of reach of host instrumentation, which is the same reason DECISIONS
§7 keeps the testable logic in host crates in the first place. It installs its own tool rather than
leaning on `bootstrap`, so the CI test job (which runs `bootstrap`) never compiles a coverage tool
it does not use.

## They are thin wrappers, on purpose

The scripts do almost nothing themselves. `script/test` is `cargo xtask test`; `script/server`
is `cargo xtask run`; `script/console` is `cargo xtask shell`. `cargo xtask` is still the
engine and still the place the real build logic lives (and it exposes more than the scripts do:
`gdb`, `objdump`, `image`, `std-aborts`). The scripts add a normalized interface on top, and nothing was
duplicated to get it. If you prefer typing `cargo xtask …`, it all still works.

## `script/` and `helpers/`

`script/` is the front door. `helpers/` is the drawer behind it: cargo runners, `qemu-bounded.sh`,
and modules the scripts import. You do not run those by hand. `bootstrap` installs system packages,
and on Linux it also builds the pinned QEMU. [helpers-and-bootstrap.md](scripts/helpers-and-bootstrap.md)
has the reasons, the exceptions and the 2026-09-23 rename from `scripts/`.

## A piped gate reports the pipe's status, not the gate's

`script/lint | tail -30; echo $?` prints `tail`'s exit code. So does `| grep`, `| head`, and
every other filter somebody reaches for to make a long gate readable. The gate can fail and the
shell will say `0`.

This is not theoretical and it is not rare. A rename lane on 2026-09-18 read exit 0 from a piped
`script/lint` while clippy was failing on a `doc_markdown` error that lane's own edit had
introduced; it was caught only by re-running the command unpiped. The maintainer session briefing
that lane had been using the same shape earlier the same night.

It is the worst kind of defect this tree can have in a gate, because it fails in the safe-looking
direction: a red gate reporting green is indistinguishable from a green one, and the whole point of
`script/lint` is that a person does not have to read it.

Write it as a redirect, and read `$?` before anything else touches it:

```console
$ script/lint > /tmp/lint.txt 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"
exit=0
$ grep -iE "^error|PROBLEM" /tmp/lint.txt      # now filter, having already read the status
```

`set -o pipefail` fixes it inside a script and is what `script/` entry points use; it is not on
by default in an interactive shell or in most one-liners, which is exactly where this bites.

Nothing gates this, and nothing plausibly could: a shell pipeline is not something the repository
can inspect. It is rung four, recorded where somebody about to run a gate is already reading.

## CI leverages them

Every job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` names one check out of `script/ci-build`'s table
(milestone 286): the format job runs `script/ci-build fmt`, the clippy job `script/ci-build lint`,
the test job `script/ci-build test swish-check`, the bench job `script/ci-build bench` and
`script/ci-build icount`, and so on down the file. So CI executes the same commands a developer
does, out of the same list, and adding a job without adding its row is the defect that list exists
to prevent. `verify.yml` is the exception and says so: Kani is sharded across jobs with its own
scope predicate, and the table does not claim it.

Before that milestone the set was written down twice, here and in `script/gates`, and nothing
compared them. All three of the places that explained the difference were stale by 2026-09-13:
`ci.yml` said `script/icount` was not in the local set (it had been since milestone 62), this file
listed four stages where the script ran six, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the pull request template
both said "five".

## The versioned hooks

`.githooks/` holds hooks the repository owns, wired by `script/setup` with
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. One line rather than copying files into `.git/hooks`,
because that directory is neither versioned nor shared, and a lane's worktree shares the main
checkout's `.git`: setting `core.hooksPath` covers every worktree at once, which is the case
that motivated the first hook.

- `pre-push` runs `script/fmt --check` (~0.7 s) and refuses the push if rustfmt would change
  a file, because CI's `rustfmt` is a required check and learning about a wrapped line from a
  runner ten minutes later is the slowest possible way to learn it. Every lane on 2026-08-15 and
  -16 paid that tax at least once. `git push --no-verify` bypasses it, deliberately: pushing a
  work-in-progress branch for safekeeping is a legitimate reason, and the hook is a courtesy to
  the queue rather than a rule about what may exist on a branch.

An existing clone installs it by rerunning `script/setup`, or by hand with the config line above.

### BUGS

- The hook is opt-in per clone. A contributor who never runs `script/setup` never has it, and
  nothing detects that; the gate in CI stays the authority, which is the correct direction for
  this to be wrong in.
- It checks the whole tree, not the pushed range. Cheap enough at this size that the
  precision is not worth the complexity, and a tree that is unformatted anywhere fails CI anyway.

## Running one kernel test (`script/test --test`)

Milestone 210. A host crate's test is a function a harness calls, so `cargo test <name>` has always
worked there. A kernel test is not: it runs inside a booted kernel under QEMU, the runner is
`kernel/src/testing.rs`'s `runner`, and until this flag existed that runner took no filter at all.
So the only way to see one kernel test was to run all 312 of them.

```
script/test --arch aarch64 --test frames_are_zeroed
```

The substring is matched against the test's full path (`core::any::type_name` of the
`#[test_case]` function), which is the same shape `cargo test <name>` matches, so a module name
selects a module's worth and a full path selects exactly one.

### What it costs, measured

The block that minted this guessed that "the boot is most of the four minutes", which would have
made the flag worth much less than it sounds. It is not. Timed on patagonia, aarch64,
`cargo xtask test --arch aarch64`:

| | |
|---|---|
| QEMU start to `running 312 tests` (objcopy, QEMU, the whole kernel boot) | **0.50 s** |
| the 312 tests themselves | **53.1 s** |
| the whole `--arch aarch64` run, host crates and builds included | **174 s** |
| the same run with `--test <one test>`, warm | **8.6 s** |

So the boot is about 1% of the QEMU leg, not most of it, and the flag is worth more than the
block expected rather than less. What is left in the 8.6 s is the fixture work `test` does before
any leg (the userspace archive, the `std` exerciser, and five disk images), not the boot.

How the filter reaches the kernel, and what a filtered run switches off, are in
[one-kernel-test.md](scripts/one-kernel-test.md).

### EXAMPLES

```
$ script/test --arch aarch64 --test the_asid_width_supports_the_allocator
--- test filter: the_asid_width_supports_the_allocator (kernel legs only; the host crates have `cargo test`) ---
--- kernel tests, aarch64 (QEMU) ---

running 1 of 312 tests (filter: the_asid_width_supports_the_allocator)

test kernel::arch::aarch64::isa::tests::the_asid_width_supports_the_allocator ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed
```

A filter that matches nothing fails the run, rather than reporting a green `0 passed`:

```
$ script/test --arch aarch64 --test no_such_test_anywhere
running 0 of 312 tests (filter: no_such_test_anywhere)
no test matches the filter `no_such_test_anywhere`
  (a test only this architecture lacks? `--test` runs every leg; add `--arch`)
```

### BUGS

- `--test` selects tests, not architectures, and that is deliberate, per DECISIONS §19
  (architectural parity is a tenet). A filter naming an architecture-specific test and no `--arch`
  runs all three legs and fails on the two that do not have it. Failing is the honest outcome,
  because the alternative (skipping a leg with no matches) makes a typo indistinguishable from a
  green run; the message names the fix.
- A filtered run proves nothing about the whole-suite instruments. The frame ledger's
  kept-frames ceiling, the thread peak and the stack high-water are all totals over 312 tests, so a
  one-test run's readings sit far under them and cannot fail. Read a green filtered run as "this
  test passes", never as "the suite would".
- Tests are not independent, and running one alone can fail honestly. A test that only passes
  because an earlier one wired a service will fail on its own. That is a true finding about the
  test rather than a defect in the flag, and it is worth reading as one.
- The fixture work is not filtered. The 8.6 s above is almost entirely archive and image
  building that happens whether or not the selected test needs a disk. Filtering that too would
  need `test` to know which fixtures a given test wants, which nothing records.
