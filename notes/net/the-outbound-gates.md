# The network stack: what the outbound gates prove, and three fixes they forced

*An appendix to [`notes/net.md`](../net.md), which is the page to read. This file holds what phase
B's gates prove, the ephemeral-port fix, the RX-poll lost wakeup, and the UDP gate's move off the
host resolver. It exists to verify or challenge the main page, and a reader who only needs to use
the socket contract should not have to open it. Moved from the main page on 2026-09-25 (UTC),
verbatim apart from links that had to follow it. The directory `notes/net/` and this file's stem are
provisional names, minted by the lane that split the file; naming is calef's.*

*Records cited below: milestone 27 (Rust `std` on the native ABI) and milestone 107 (the socket
contract learns to accept).*

## What the gate proves, and what it does not

Both tests are deterministic and zero-host-setup, run over both the mmio and the PCI-behind-IOMMU
transports, on aarch64 and riscv64:

- **UDP, `a_client_resolves_dns_through_the_socket_contract`.** A real DNS A-query for `example.com`
  to slirp's built-in resolver (10.0.2.3:53); the client verifies the reply is a response (QR bit) to
  its own transaction id. Proves UDP send and receive through the whole path (client, net_stack, smoltcp,
  confined NIC). It relies on the test host being able to resolve DNS, which slirp forwards; a host
  with no resolver would make this time out.
- **TCP, `a_client_echoes_over_tcp_through_the_socket_contract`.** A full round trip against a slirp
  `guestfwd` echo peer: the runners add `guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.9:7777-cmd:/bin/cat` to each NIC's
  `-netdev user`, so a guest connection to 10.0.2.9:7777 is piped to a fresh `/bin/cat`. The client
  does OPEN_TCP, CONNECT (the three-way handshake completes against a real peer), SEND a payload,
  RECV the echo and check it byte for byte, then CLOSE (the FIN). No host port is bound and nothing
  outlives QEMU, so the whole round trip, handshake through bidirectional data to teardown, is in the
  committed gate with zero host setup. Verified against QEMU 11.0.2.

**Not proven by the gate, when this was written:** inbound connections. A `LISTEN`/`accept` verb
plus a QEMU `hostfwd` (host port -> guest) is the way to test the guest accepting a connection, and
that is future work; the contract has no listen verb yet. The concurrency model on the [main page](../net.md) is the other
limit: one synchronous exchange at a time, no overlapping connections.

**Milestone 107 built exactly that**, and the paragraph above is kept as the record of the gap
rather than edited away. See "The inbound half" on the [main page](../net.md) and in [the-inbound-half.md](the-inbound-half.md) for the verbs, the two design questions they
raised, and what the gate proves now. The concurrency sentence still stands, with one qualification
the accept work earned: a single listener now serves connections one after another without dropping
the next, which is not the same as serving two at once.

This binds milestone 27's `std::net` PAL, replacing its `Unsupported`. Scope discipline held: TCP,
UDP, DHCP, no sockets-API mimicry beyond what the PAL needs.

## Ephemeral ports must be independent of the socket id (a fix the PAL found)

The first version of net_stack derived a socket's local port from its socket id (`LOCAL_PORT_BASE + sid`).
That is wrong, and the `std::net` PAL flushed it out: a program that opens a TCP socket, closes it,
and opens another reuses the same socket id, so it reused the exact local port. Reconnecting to the
same peer on an identical 4-tuple whose slirp flow had not yet cleared makes the SYN go unanswered,
and net_stack stalled in its bounded connect poll forever. Bisection confirmed it: a fresh id connects, a
reused id hangs.

The fix is what any real stack does: net_stack allocates ephemeral local ports from a private range with a
**rotating allocator** independent of the socket id (`components/src/net_stack.rs`, `PortAllocator`). Each open
advances the cursor, so a just-closed connection's port is not handed out again until the whole range
has cycled, and a port a live socket still holds is skipped outright. Socket-id reuse is then safe:
the reopened socket gets a new local port, a new 4-tuple, and a new slirp flow.

The regression is `a_reopened_socket_id_connects_again_over_tcp` (both ISAs): open a TCP socket,
connect to the guestfwd echo peer, close, reopen the *same* id, and connect again; the client reports
OK only if both connects complete. Before the fix the second connect hangs the way the PAL saw.

## The RX poll must honor smoltcp's timers, not just the interrupt (a riscv-SMP lost-wakeup)

`std_net` hung on riscv under the 4-hart boot, watchdog-killed with every core idle and every thread
blocked, while the same test passed on aarch64 and the lighter DHCP and TCP-echo tests passed on
riscv in the same run. The shape said lost wakeup; the cause was subtler than a dropped interrupt.

The old server loop blocked on the NIC interrupt between polls: `poll; if done break; WAIT; ack`. That
is fine until an exchange depends on one of smoltcp's *own* timers. smoltcp drives TCP retransmits,
delayed ACKs, and DNS timeouts from its clock, which only advances when we call `poll`. If a segment's
ACK is dropped, the peer goes quiet waiting for our retransmit, and our retransmit is a timer event
that only fires on the next `poll`, which we are not doing because we are blocked on an interrupt the
peer will never send. net_stack waits for the peer, the peer waits for net_stack, both idle. Instrumenting the
PLIC at the hang showed the truth: **no source pending, the net source still enabled**. Not a masked
line, not a lost IRQ; the device was simply idle, because both ends were waiting on the same stalled
timer. aarch64 happened never to drop a segment (different servicing latency), so it never armed the
retransmit path; the riscv SMP scatter, which moves the driver and its wakes across harts, was slow
enough to drop one and expose the hole. It was not the IRQ affinity: forcing every source back to the
boot hart's PLIC context still hung, which ruled the PLIC out.

The fix (`wait_for_nic`, `components/src/net_stack.rs`) asks smoltcp when it next needs to run. With **no** timer
pending (`poll_delay` is `None`), it blocks on the interrupt, the common case, 0% CPU until a frame
arrives, and correct because with nothing of our own outstanding we are purely waiting on the peer,
whose retransmit will wake us. With a timer **pending**, it does not block: it yields and lets the
loop re-`poll`, so the timer fires and the retransmit goes out. The busy interval is confined to the
short retransmit window rather than the whole exchange. Both the DHCP bring-up loop and the
service loop use it. `std_net` then completes on both ISAs at the 4-hart/4-core boot.

The honest caveat: yielding across a retransmit window spins a hart until the timer is due (bounded by
the exchange, and by a 15 s per-call backstop well under the 60 s watchdog). The clean version is a
*timed* wait, a `WAIT` that returns on either the interrupt or a deadline, so the server sleeps
through the backoff instead of spinning. That is a small kernel-surface addition (an `Irq::WAIT`
timeout, or a timer notification) and is left as the follow-up; the yield-poll is correct and needs no
new syscall.

## The UDP gate must not depend on the host's resolver (a testing-hygiene defect, fixed)

The UDP socket-contract test queried `10.0.2.3:53` and called it "slirp's built-in resolver". That
description was wrong, and the error was not cosmetic: **10.0.2.3 is not a resolver.** libslirp
implements no DNS server. It NATs anything sent to its guest-visible nameserver address to the
*host's* configured nameserver, which it looks up with `get_dns_addr_libresolv`. So every run of that
"zero host setup" gate sent a real query out of the machine to whatever resolver the developer's
laptop happened to be using, and passed only if that resolver answered in time.

It was measured, not argued. A temporary instrument in the client sent the same `example.com` query
40 times in one boot and reported what came back:

- **1 of 40 queries got no answer** (2.5%), with a 15 s wait per query, so it is loss and not slowness.
- The answer's `ANCOUNT` was 2 and its first A record was `0x6814179a` = `104.20.23.154`, byte for
  byte what `dig @192.168.8.1 example.com` returned on the host at that moment. libslirp carries no
  zone data for `example.com` and cannot invent Cloudflare's rotating addresses, so this is direct
  proof that the host's resolver answered the guest's query.
- The same host resolver, probed directly with `dig +tries=1 +time=2`, dropped 1 of 30.

Two DNS queries ran per suite (mmio and PCIe), so a suite failed a few percent of the time from
nothing but a dropped packet on somebody's LAN, which matches the roughly one-in-three seen across a
handful of runs once network conditions were worse. UDP has no retransmit of its own and the client
sent exactly once, so a single lost datagram was a failed gate.

**The fix keeps the coverage and removes the dependency.** The gating UDP test now talks to slirp's
**own TFTP server** (`tftp=` on the netdev, at the gateway `10.0.2.2:69`), which libslirp answers
itself. The client sends a read request for a fixture the runners plant and asserts the reply is
`DATA`, block 1, with the fixture's exact bytes. This is the UDP twin of the guestfwd `/bin/cat` echo
peer the TCP gate already used: QEMU provides the service, nothing leaves the emulator, and no packet
can be dropped by a third party.

What the gate proves now: a client holding only a `Stack` endpoint and a shared frame can open a UDP
socket by id, send a datagram to an address of its choosing, and read the reply back through the same
frame, over both the mmio and PCIe transports, on both ISAs. That is the whole client-to-net_stack-to-
smoltcp-to-confined-NIC path, which is what the test was ever really for.

What it no longer proves, deliberately: that DNS resolution works, or that the guest can reach
anything outside the emulator. That case did not get deleted; it became **non-gating**. The client
still sends a real query (now with three attempts, which is ordinary resolver behaviour rather than a
widened timeout) and reports a distinct `NO_ANSWER` when the host never replies, which the kernel test
prints and skips. A reply that arrives but is *not* a valid answer to our transaction still fails the
suite, because that would be our defect rather than the network's. So a broken host resolver, or an
offline laptop, now skips a check instead of failing a build, and a broken socket contract still fails
loudly.

The PCIe DNS variant is gone, not lost: UDP over the PCIe transport is now covered by the TFTP gate's
PCIe twin, deterministically.
