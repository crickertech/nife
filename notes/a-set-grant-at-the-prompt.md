# A set grant at the prompt: how a matched pattern reaches the progenitor

**Status: PROPOSED, not decided.** Written 2026-09-26 (UTC) by milestone 47 (navigation and
naming)'s lane `milestone/47-navigation`. It answers the item milestone 47's block and milestone 109
(`xargs`) both carry: "the shell cannot ask the progenitor to mint a per-batch caretaker." It is a
change to `spawnproto`, which the shell and the progenitor both read, so it is an architect's call.
Nothing here is built. The file name is provisional.

## The premise, checked, and it is wider than the record says

The record says `xargs <program>` stops after batch one. The cause reaches further. At the real
prompt, any pattern that matches more than one name is refused before anything spawns, with or
without `xargs`:

- `components/src/swish.rs`, `dir_grant`: `g.names.only()` is `None` for a set, and the shell answers
  "a set of names is delivered by a nameset caretaker, and the progenitor builds the subtree one;
  name a single file".
- `crates/grant_plan/src/spawnproto.rs`: `DIR_BIT` announces two more `SEND`s carrying the caretaker's
  and the child's three start words. A single name fits in two words. A set does not, and no bit
  says one follows.
- The set caretaker exists and is proven (`components/src/fs_nameset_caretaker.rs`,
  `kernel/src/user/glob_grant_tests.rs`), but only a kernel test harness wires it. The progenitor
  builds `fs_subtree_caretaker` and nothing else.

So `rm *.txt` over two files is refused at a keyboard today, and `xargs rm` stops at batch one for
the same reason: every batch is a set.

## What the caretaker needs that a subtree grant does not

`fs_nameset_caretaker` starts with the directory's name and rights in its three start words (the
subtree caretaker's shape) plus a read-only frame at `SET_VA` holding the encoded set
(`filesystem_protocol::nameset`, `BYTES` = 137 for eight names of up to sixteen bytes). It copies the
set into a local at startup and never reads the frame again.

The progenitor must therefore receive up to 137 bytes of set per spawn, and build that frame.

## The options

| | What travels | Cost | Where it fails |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Leave it** | Nothing | Zero | A pattern at the prompt designates one name or is refused. `xargs <program>` never runs a batch |
| **2. The set as data words** (`SET_BIT`, provisional): with `DIR_BIT`, up to six more `SEND`s of three words (24 bytes each) carry the encoded set | The progenitor decodes and checks the encoding (`nameset::count`), writes it into a frame retyped from the caretaker's region, maps it read-only at `SET_VA`. One transient slot for the frame, freed after the build, as `build_child` already does for segments | The shell cannot change the set after sending it. `DIR_BIT`'s own "the protocol carries data, not capabilities" precedent, and the one this block's environment pricing (2026-08-18) already costed |
| **3. The set as a frame the shell owns** (§219 (how the shell names an installed program to the spawner) option D's shape): one `SEND_CAP` of a frame the shell wrote | One page from the shell's budget per spawn, one transient slot in the progenitor | The shell keeps write access, so the progenitor must copy before mapping or the caretaker's startup copy races the shell. That copy makes it option 2 with a page in the middle |
| **4. Batches of one**, no wire change: `xargs` plans one name per batch, delivered by the subtree caretaker that already works | One spawn per name. Unix's `xargs -n 1` | Works today for `xargs rm`. Does nothing for a plain `rm *.txt`, and it is a stopgap: if options 2 and 4 cost the same, 2 wins. It is recommended only as effort, and says so |

Recommendation: option 2, because the carrier is data the progenitor checks rather than a page
somebody else can still write. It keeps the progenitor's slot arithmetic where it is: no permanent
slot, one transient.

## Costs that must be measured, not asserted

- The progenitor's capability table. `kernel::cap::CAPABILITY_TABLE_PEAK_MEASURED` is 23 of 24,
  and its doc says the next addition should buy a slot back. Option 2 adds one *transient* slot on a
  directory-granted spawn. Whether that spawn path's peak is below the login block's peak is
  unmeasured; `script/swish-check` fails loudly on this, as it did twice before.
- Shared-page audit finding 1 becomes reachable. `notes/shared-page-audit.md` records that one
  FS frame is shared read-write by every client and that the set caretaker checks a name, then the
  FS server reads it again from that frame. It is unreachable today because "the shell is the only
  holder". A prompt-built set caretaker running beside another writer of that frame (a `>` file
  caretaker in the same pipeline, say) makes the window live. The fix, a frame per client channel,
  is that note's proposal A, never minted until this lane filed it as
  `design/roadmap/proposals/a-frame-per-filesystem-client-channel.md`. Option 2 should wait for it
  or land with it.
- The progenitor must carry `fs_nameset_caretaker`'s ELF, parsed from the measured archive as
  `care_elf` is. Its cost in the progenitor's own pages is unmeasured.

## What this does not decide

The eight-name bound (`MAX_NAMES`), which stays a stack decision in the shell; `mv *.txt dir/`, which
a set capability cannot express by design (`notes/glob-grant.md`); and the provisional name
`SET_BIT`.
