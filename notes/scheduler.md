# The scheduler: per-core run queues, two-choice placement, message-shaped stealing

This is the working note for DECISIONS §28 (SMP placement) as built. The decision record is the
authority on *why*; this is *how it fits together* and the caveats worth rereading.

## The shape

Each core owns one run queue, single-owner, touched only by that core with interrupts masked
(`cpu::PerCpu::with_runq`). No core takes another core's run-queue lock, ever. The only cross-core
structure is a per-core migration **inbox** (a real lock) plus the reschedule SGI that pokes a core
to drain it. That is the whole concurrency surface: run queues are private, the inbox is the one
shared thing, and it is small.

Two relaxed atomics mirror a core's load so another core can read it without touching the queue:
`runq_len` (updated in `with_runq`) and `inbox_len` (updated under the inbox lock). `runnable()` is
their sum. Stale reads are fine and expected; every placement and steal decision tolerates being a
beat out of date (the gossip lesson).

## Placement: the power of two choices

`spawn` -> `pick_spawn_target`: a per-core xorshift PRNG picks two online cores, the lighter by
`runnable()` wins, the thread is carried there by `spawn_on` (local push, or remote via the inbox +
SGI). Near-optimal balancing that reads at most two remote counters no matter the core count. The
PRNG is seeded per core from a fixed constant, so a given boot makes the same choices and the
icount benches stay reproducible. One online core: a no-op.

## Stealing: pull, by message

An idle core's `run_idle` calls `try_initiate_steal`: pick the most-loaded *other* core by run-queue
depth alone (never its inbox, which is work already in flight to it), CAS a one-slot steal request,
and poke it with the reschedule SGI. The victim's `serve_steal_request`, at its next scheduler
entry, hands back one queued thread through the requester's inbox. Pull beats push under
uncertainty, and no shared run-queue lock ever appears. Cost: a steal lands a tick late, bounded.

## Wakes: local for a rendezvous, load-aware for a device interrupt (§28.2, as amended)

An IPC rendezvous wakes its partner on the **waker's** core: the message is in registers, the cache
is warm, and a serial pipeline (net_stack<->std) stays co-located and fast. `wake` does this, and every
IPC path, supervision, and revocation uses it.

A **device interrupt** is different: it carries no locality, and pinning the woken driver to the
IRQ-handling core re-concentrates a pipeline or drops it on a busy core. So `irq_notify` wakes
**load-aware** through `wake_load_aware` / `pick_wake_target`: the least-loaded core, ties won by
the current core so a driver taking a completion interrupt every request (the block server at a
RedoxFS mount) is not migrated each time. The device-line **affinity** that spreads which core takes
each IRQ in the first place is the companion mechanism, in notes/interrupts.md.

## The undelivered-wake gate (boot 8, VisionFive 2)

A wake is not a favor, it is the second half of a delivery, and since 2026-08-14 the scheduler
enforces that. Every genuine wake of a thread parked in IPC happens in the same `SCHED` critical
section that gave the parked operation something to return: a rendezvous stages the mailbox, an
interrupt counts a signal, a reply fills the reply words, revocation flags the abort. Each of
those sites sets the handshake's `ipc_served` (or `ipc_aborted`; both on
`wake_handshake::Handshake`, embedded in `Thread`) before calling `wake`, and `wake` /
`wake_load_aware` **refuse** to make a waiting thread Ready when neither flag is set, recording
`refuse:tid` on the per-core event ring. The parked thread stays parked and still linked on its
endpoint's wait queue, and the real counterparty completes the rendezvous normally later.

The gate turns that transition into a refused no-op plus a ring event, whoever the caller is; the
recv tails carry a `debug_assert` tripwire ("resumed with nothing delivered") for the state the
gate makes unreachable, and every `ipc_served` setter records a `serve:tid/site` ring event so a
bench dump names who completed a rendezvous instead of leaving it to inference.

**The failure it was built against was misread, and that correction is the important part of this
section.** It was built from the VisionFive 2's boot 8 (notes/visionfive2.md, fourth bench stop),
read at the time as the boot thread, parked in `ipc_recv`, taking a `wake:0x0` on a boot where no
sender to its endpoint existed. The boot-8 lane's **fifth** bench stop (2026-08-15) re-read those
dumps and overturned it: the wake was the worker's real send, and the dump state read as a
stranded receiver was the terminal state of a completed tour. **So the gate has never fired on a
field failure, and `refuse:` has never appeared on a board ring.**

It stays anyway, and the reason is not sunk cost. The transition it forbids really would complete a
rendezvous off a stale mailbox while the TCB stayed linked on its endpoint queue, and the loom
harness below proves that as a property of the protocol rather than as a story about one boot. What
changes is the claim: this is hardening against a reachable state, not a repair of a field failure,
and anything that cites it as the latter is now wrong.

Recorded here on 2026-08-15, ahead of the lane that found it, because `crates/wake_handshake` and
this section both asserted the original reading as fact while that lane sat blocked on a merge
conflict. The fifth stop's full write-up is notes/visionfive2.md's fifth bench stop, landed with
the same change that added the `serve:` witnesses.

Two companions from the same boot, kept for the same hardening reason: `ipc_reply`, the one wake
site addressed by a tid rather than through an endpoint pop, delivers only to a thread whose
`wait_on` says it awaits a reply (anything else would clobber a parked receiver's mailbox and
double-enqueue its one intrusive link), and `schedule()` refuses to switch into its own current
thread (the shape a spuriously queued current produces), because that restores an
already-consumed context and time-travels the thread onto a reused stack. Guarded by
`a_wake_without_delivery_cannot_complete_a_parked_recv` and
`a_reply_to_a_thread_parked_as_a_receiver_is_dropped`, which inject through the real `wake` path.

**The protocol is a crate now, and loom searches it** (2026-08-14, the retrofit the fourth bench
stop's audit asked for). The whole block/wake state machine (`state`, `on_cpu`, `wake_pending`,
`wait_on`, `ipc_served`, `ipc_aborted`, and the gate, deferral and finish-switch transitions over
them) lives in `crates/wake_handshake`, embedded in `Thread` and **called** by `sched.rs` rather
than mirrored, so the model-checked code and the shipped code are the same code. Each of the
protocol's three hazards (wake-before-switch-out, the steal edge of the same window, and the
undelivered wake) is a loom harness that holds with the current semantics and a `#[should_panic]`
reconstruction that fails with the historical ones. Two of the three are races observed on the
machine; the third is the undelivered wake, which the section above records as reachable but never
witnessed, so "three recorded races" overstated it and this says hazards instead. See
notes/interleaving.md
for the model's honest limits.

**BUGS.** The gate protects threads whose `wait_on` is set, which is every IPC block site today; a
future block path that forgets to set `wait_on` opts itself out silently. A kernel-thread caller
of `ipc_recv` still cannot tell an abort from a message unless it checks `take_ipc_aborted`
itself; the gate guarantees *something* was delivered, not which thing. And the blocking
`ipc_send` resume path carries no tripwire assert, deliberately: it takes no lock after
`schedule()` today, and adding one on the IPC hot path to double-check an invariant the gate
already holds was judged not worth the cycles the bench tripwire watches.

## The costs migration made real

Turning on any migration at all strips the accidental cover off same-core assumptions. Two bit us
and are now fixed and tested:

- **RISC-V `tp` (the per-hart pointer) is thread-frame state.** A kernel thread preempted on one
  hart and resumed on another used to come back reading the wrong hart's per-CPU block. Fixed in
  `arch/riscv64/trap.s`; the full story and the regression test are in notes/riscv-port.md. aarch64
  is immune (its pointer is a system register the frame never carries). This is the concrete face of
  rule 4 (assume weak ordering) and rule 1 (arch state lives in arch).

- **The hang watchdog counts progress, not test starts.** A slow-but-live workload (std_net spends
  about 300 s in net_stack's userspace smoltcp poll, CPU-bound, no wakes or output for stretches over a
  minute) must not read as a deadlock. The watchdog credits a completed wake, a line of output, OR
  any core running a non-idle thread; only a real lost wakeup, every thread blocked and every core on
  its idle thread, stalls it. See `kernel/src/testing.rs`.

- **And because that alone traded a flake for a silent hang, there is also a per-test wall-clock
  ceiling.** See the section below: the progress heartbeat is blind to a livelock that keeps doing
  IPC, which is a real failure we hit, not a theoretical one.

## The two hang watchdogs, and what each one cannot see

The harness asks two independent questions, and either failing fails the run. They exist because there
are two ways a test never finishes, and no single instrument sees both.

| | **No-progress heartbeat** | **Per-test wall-clock ceiling** |
|---|---|---|
| Question | Is anything happening at all? | Has this test taken longer than allowed? |
| Catches | Deadlock, lost wakeup | Any non-terminating test, livelock included |
| Window | ~60 s of total silence | The test's budget (90 s default) |
| Blind to | Any loop that keeps doing IPC | Nothing that fails to terminate, but slow to react |
| Scope | Anywhere, including before tests start | Only while a test is running |

**Why the ceiling had to be added.** The heartbeat credits a completed rendezvous as progress. The
RedoxFS repeat-write livelock spins in an allocator commit *while still serving blk IPC*, so every
rendezvous reset the heartbeat: a failure that had been a loud 60 s trip became an infinite silent
hang at about 400% CPU with no watchdog fire. A livelock that makes progress is indistinguishable from
healthy work to a progress-only instrument. Turning a loud failure into a silent one is worse than the
flake the heartbeat fixed, so both mechanisms are live now.

**Why budgets are per test.** std_net honestly runs 300 to 344 s, so one global ceiling would sit near
700 s and let a two-second unit test spin for eleven minutes before failing. The default is a tight
90 s; a test that is honestly slower declares its cost in `SLOW_TESTS` in `testing.rs`, with the
reason. Keep entries near 2x measured, so host load does not make them flaky.

**The honest limit.** Neither mechanism can tell a livelock from slow-but-correct work while it is
running. Only the budget, a human declaration of expected cost, separates them. That is why a new
`SLOW_TESTS` entry deserves a sentence about *why* the test is slow, not just a number.

**Proving it.** The `watchdog_probe` feature adds a test that loops forever doing a full rendezvous
each pass, so the heartbeat sees a healthy kernel and only the ceiling stops it. It is expected to
fail, so it is not in the normal suite:

```text
scripts/qemu-bounded.sh 200 cargo test -p kernel \
    --features watchdog_probe --target aarch64-unknown-none-softfloat
```

**The outermost backstop.** `scripts/qemu-bounded.sh` still guards the case where the kernel wedges so
hard the timer IRQ stops. It did not fire for the RedoxFS livelock only because that run invoked
`cargo` directly instead of the wrapper: **a bypassable backstop is not a backstop**, which is exactly
why the ceiling lives in the kernel, where nothing can route around it.

## CLOSED: the lost wakeup on `reclaim_frees_a_started_then_exited_childs_regions`

**A refused region reclaim killed the child the test was waiting for.** One line of test code, no
kernel defect, and not a RISC-V defect either: reproduced on aarch64 the moment the window was
widened. Milestone 72, 2026-08-03.

### What it was

The test opened by probing the refusal:

```rust
crate::sched::start_tcb(tid, [0; 3]).expect("start");
// "Ready but not yet run ... The refusal leaves the region untouched."
assert!(crate::sched::reclaim_region(tcb_region).is_err());
let got = crate::sched::ipc_recv(report)[0];   // waits for the child's SEND
```

That comment was true when it was written and stopped being true when DECISIONS §16 was amended.
A refused reclaim is **not** passive any more: `reap_region_objects` sets `killed = true` on every
live thread in the region and *then* returns `Err`, so the owner's retry can tear a runaway down.
§24's `^C` escalation is built on exactly that. So the probe marked the child `killed`, and
`schedule()` converts a killed thread to a corpse at its next preemption:

```rust
if t.killed && t.state == State::Running { t.state = State::Finished; }
```

From there it is a plain race between the child's nine instructions and its own core's next timer
tick. Win it and the child SENDs, the test passes, and the armed kill is harmless because the child
was about to exit anyway. Lose it and the child is reaped **without ever sending**, `ipc_recv`
blocks forever, every core falls to idle, and the 60 s heartbeat fires.

Why host load moved it from "never seen locally" to one run in four is not measured here, but the
likely mechanism is that a vCPU thread the host deschedules comes back with its guest timer deadline
already past, so the tick lands at the first instruction it executes rather than ten milliseconds of
guest work later. The window is wall clock, not instruction count, and an oversubscribed host is
what turns those into different numbers.

### How it was proved, since a one-in-four race is not evidence

**Widen the window instead of waiting for it** (the method milestone 71 used on the frame fault).
A call-free three-instruction delay loop in front of `REPORT_STUB`, sized to span several ticks:

```text
riscv64   lui t0, 0x4000 ; addi t0, t0, -1 ; bne t0, x0, -4
aarch64   mov x5, #0x4000000 ; subs x5, x5, #1 ; b.ne -4
```

With the probe in place that hangs the watchdog on the **first run and every run**, on both ISAs.
With the probe removed the same widened child passes. Temporary prints in the two suspect lines
caught the whole chain in order:

```text
[M72] child tid=0xe00000065 started
[M72] ARM kill tid=0xe00000065 state=Running
[M72] reclaim(tcb_region) -> Err(())
[M72] CONVERT killed->Finished tid=0xe00000065
WATCHDOG: no progress for ~60 s. Every core idle, every thread blocked: a lost-wakeup hang.
```

The forced dump matched the four wild occurrences exactly: **101 threads, 109 endpoints**, every
thread `wake_pending=false on_cpu=false`, all four inboxes empty. Same fingerprint, same hang.

### The fix, and what it costs

The probe is deleted. Nothing else changed. The refusal's own behaviour is proved by
`user::force_kill_tests::destroy_force_kills_a_runaway_and_reclaims_its_region`, which points the
destructive call at a runaway that is *meant* to die, and that is the only subject it can honestly
be pointed at. `reclaim_region` now carries a `BUGS` section saying so where a caller meets it.

**Confirmed under the original recipe**: four host burners, the riscv64 leg twenty times,
**0 watchdog hangs**. Three of the twenty failed on something else, and all three are the
bounded-yield-under-contention class this file already documents further down
(`a_thread_that_never_yields_is_preempted_anyway`, `a_blocked_waiter_wakes_with_an_error_when_its_endpoint_is_revoked`,
and the sibling at `sched.rs:2709`). They fail in 23 s with a named assertion, not at 60 s with a
dump, so the two are never confusable once you look. A 15% rate for that class under four burners is
worth someone's attention on its own; it is not this.

**The local aarch64 rate is not measurable with this recipe, and that is worth knowing before
someone tries.** Ten pre-fix aarch64 runs under the same four burners gave **0 hangs**, which sounds
like "rarer on aarch64" and is not evidence of anything: **five of the ten died earlier in the boot**
on the bounded-yield contention flakes, before the suite ever reached this test. The aarch64 leg is
much more prone to those under burners than riscv64 is (5 in 10 against 3 in 20), so the burners
break the instrument before they exercise it. The aarch64 evidence that counts is the widened-window
control and the wild CI hit, neither of which needs a rate.

**The fix is not a rate reduction, which is the thing to check it against.** Deleting the probe means
the child is never marked `killed`, so the conversion that reaped it has no input and cannot happen
on any machine at any speed. That distinction matters because the observed *rates* vary wildly and
say nothing about whether the cure works: never seen locally at first, one in four under four
burners, and **three consecutive failures on one CI pull request** (#29, docs-only) on the shared
runners. All three numbers are what the mechanism predicts, because the loser of the race is decided
by how much wall clock the guest gets between the child being switched in and its `ecall`, and a
two-core shared runner emulating four harts gives it very little. A hot rate is evidence the window
is wide there, not evidence of a second bug.

**Occurrences:**

| When | Where | ISA |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-03 | CI, `rva23s64` (PR #20) | riscv64 |
| 2026-08-03 | CI, PR #21, which changed two markdown files and **zero lines of code** | riscv64 |
| 2026-08-03 | CI, `thead-c906` (PR #23, the frame fix), guard silent | riscv64 |
| 2026-08-03 | local, four host burners, 1 run in 4 | riscv64 |
| 2026-08-03 | local, widened window, first run and every run | **aarch64** |
| 2026-08-03 | CI, PR #29, which changed `design/roadmap.md` and nothing else | **aarch64** |

Every row is the same test and the same watchdog. The last one arrived in the wild, on the aarch64
runner (`scripts/qemu-runner.sh`, `target/aarch64-unknown-none-softfloat`), while this milestone was
being written, and it is the independent confirmation of what the widened-window control had already
shown.

### Why the first four were all riscv64, and why it is not a RISC-V property

The answer is **exposure, not the ISA**, and it is countable rather than arguable. Per pull request,
CI boots the suite seven times: once on aarch64 and once on riscv64 in `build + test`, then **five
more riscv64 boots** in the `cpu matrix` job, which runs `script/cpu-matrix` over `rv64`,
`sifive-u54`, `rva22s64`, `rva23s64` and `thead-c906` and deliberately does not stop at the first
failure. **Six riscv64 rolls of the dice to one aarch64 roll.** Four riscv64 sightings before the
first aarch64 one is what a 6:1 exposure ratio produces on its own.

Two explanations offered along the way were wrong, and both are recorded because each is the kind
that sounds right:

- **"riscv64 loses the race more often under TCG."** Written in an earlier draft of this section, by
  this milestone. Possible, unmeasured, and unnecessary once the exposure ratio is counted.
- **"riscv64 runs first, so it failed first and the aarch64 leg never got there."** Offered while the
  aarch64 hit was being reported, and it is backwards: `xtask test` runs the **aarch64 leg first**
  and `return false`s on its failure, so a riscv64-only sighting is a run in which aarch64 was given
  its chance and passed. The four riscv64 CI hits came from `cpu matrix`, which has no aarch64 leg to
  order against.

§19 says parity is a gate. The corollary this bug supplies is that a failure appearing on one ISA is
a *claim* about that ISA, and the cheapest way to test the claim is to widen the window on the other
one, not to reason about what is arch-specific. Careful reasoning was done here, and it pointed at
RISC-V for four days.

### The accumulation is not this bug, and the aarch64 hit does not make it one

The **101 threads and 109 endpoints** were the lead everyone followed first, including this
milestone's brief, and they are a real thing that is not this.

**The A/B settles it.** Under the widened window the tree hangs with one line of test code present
and passes with it removed, on both ISAs, deterministically, and the accumulation is **identical in
both arms**: same tests before it, same 101 threads, same 109 endpoints. A cause you can leave in
place while the effect disappears is not the cause. There is also a mechanism for the thing that
does explain it, traced print by print, which the accumulation never had.

It is worth saying because the aarch64 sighting reads at first like evidence *for* the accumulation:
the leak is shared scheduler state present on both ISAs, so a second ISA failing is what you would
predict if the leak were the cause. It is also what you would predict from portable `sched.rs` code
and a race, which is what it turned out to be, and the two predictions are the same. **A prediction
both hypotheses make cannot choose between them.** The A/B can, and did.

The supporting reasons stand on their own too. The threads are blocked, so they add no scheduling
load and no run-queue depth; 109 endpoints is a fifth of `MAX_ENDPOINTS`. The suite arrives at this
test that way on **both** ISAs (`notes/riscv-parity-scope.md` measured the table at 87 on each at the
leak police), so it never could have explained an ISA skew either.

It is still worth its own milestone: 101 of `MAX_THREADS = 128` is 79% of a hard `create_tcb`
failure, and the leak police only polices *runnable* leaks, so a blocked leak is invisible to it by
construction. Nothing today would warn before the suite hit the wall.

### The general lesson

**A call that returns `Err` may still have done something.** `reclaim_region(r).is_err()` reads like
a question and is an act; the test used it as a question and the comment beside it asserted the
opposite of the truth. When a semantic is amended, the amendment lands in the function it changed,
and every caller that encoded the old semantic in a *comment* keeps compiling.

## CLOSED: a second lost wakeup, and the fingerprint is what told the two apart

**`spawn_on` asked "is this target my own core?" twice, on either side of a window in which the
asking thread can be stolen onto a different core.** When the two answers disagreed the placement
went into a remote core's inbox and the reschedule SGI that makes an inbox get drained was skipped,
so the thread sat `Ready` forever beside four idle cores. Found 2026-08-28 on the generic `rv64`
CPU-matrix leg of PR #574's run 33147291785, whose diff is a shell script, a baseline file and a
note, and so could not have caused it.

### It shares a watchdog message with the section above and is a different bug

That is the whole reason this subsection leads with the comparison. The message
(`WATCHDOG: no progress for ~60 s. Every core idle, every thread blocked: a lost-wakeup hang.`) is
the *instrument*, not the diagnosis, and the first reading of this failure in the wild was "that
known riscv64 class recurring". The dump refutes it in four fields, against the one recorded by
milestone 72, "A lost wakeup that a hundred leaked threads may be causing":

| | Milestone 72's dump | This one |
|---|---|---|
| Threads | 101 | **120** |
| Endpoints | 109 | **119** |
| Thread states | every one `Blocked` | **one `Ready`**, 115 `Blocked`, 4 idle threads `Running` |
| `wake_pending` | false everywhere | false everywhere |
| Inboxes | **all four empty** | **`core 2: inbox_len=1`**, the other three empty |
| Hung in | `reclaim_frees_a_started_then_exited_childs_regions` | `a_frame_capability_shares_a_page_and_a_read_only_view_cannot_write_it` |

**A `Ready` thread is the tell, and the watchdog's own wording hides it.** "Every thread blocked" is
what the heartbeat concluded from making no progress; it is not something it checked. One thread was
runnable the entire minute. Read the dump, not the banner.

### What it was

`place_on` decides local-or-remote by comparing `target` against `cpu::id()`, under `IPC_TABLES`,
which masks interrupts. Both of its callers then made the *same* comparison a second time to decide
whether to send the SGI, and both made it with interrupts enabled:

- `spawn_on` read `let remote = target != cpu::id()` **before taking the lock at all.**
- `start_thread_control_block` re-read `target != cpu::id()` **after `drop(guard)`**, which unmasks
  interrupts before the comparison runs.

Between the two reads the calling thread can be preempted, land back on its own core's run queue,
and be handed to an idle core by a work steal (§28.3). It resumes somewhere else holding a stale
answer. In the direction that hurts, the first read said "local" and the placement went remote: the
thread lands in a core's inbox and nothing pokes that core.

**Nothing else drains an inbox.** `drain_inbox` has exactly one caller per architecture, the
reschedule-SGI handler. `schedule()` does not look at the inbox, and neither does `run_idle`, which
is `try_initiate_steal(); wait_for_interrupt(); yield_now()` forever. So a missed SGI is permanent
rather than late.

**And the target then refuses to rescue itself.** `try_initiate_steal` returns early when
`runnable() > 0`, and `runnable()` counts the inbox, on purpose: an idle core with work in transit
should wait for its own work rather than steal more. Here the "work in transit" is never arriving,
so the guard that normally prevents a redundant steal instead pins the core in idle. That is why
one lost SGI wedges the whole machine and not just one thread.

### How it was diagnosed, from the dump alone

The per-core trace rings (`--- thread dump ---`, added for the VisionFive 2 first-silicon work)
caught the migration in the act, which is why this needed no reproduction to name:

```text
core 2: ... switch:0x0 ... switch:0x1000000076 steal:0x0/3 block:0x1000000076/176 switch:0x3
core 3: ... switch:0xf00000076 switch:0x4 drain:0x1 switch:0x0 place:0x500000077/2 block:0x0/177 switch:0x4
```

Read in order: core 2 was running tid `0x0` (the test's main thread), switched to the frame
producer, then **served a steal of tid `0x0` to core 3** (`steal:0x0/3`). Core 3 drained one thread
(`drain:0x1`), ran it (`switch:0x0`), and *that* is where the `place:0x500000077/2` happens: main
finished, on core 3, a `spawn_on` whose "is it local" answer it had computed on core 2. The push
went to core 2. No SGI followed it, because the stale answer said local.

The rest of the dump is the consequence, and every field agrees:

```text
tid=0x500000077 state=Ready  on_cpu=false address_space=0x00000000 wait=-        the consumer, never run
tid=0x1000000076 state=Blocked wait=0x1b0/Sender                                 the producer, no receiver
tid=0x0000       state=Blocked wait=0x1b1/Receiver                               main, waiting for the verdict
core 2: current=0x0003 idle=0x0003 need_resched=false inbox_len=1                the consumer, undrained
```

`page_frame_service::wire` spawns a producer and a consumer and then `ipc_recv`s their verdict. The
consumer never ran, so the producer blocked sending to it, so main blocked receiving from them.

**The trace ring is what made this a two-hour bug instead of a four-day one.** Milestone 72's entry
above says careful reasoning pointed at RISC-V for four days; the difference here is not better
reasoning, it is an instrument that records the transition rather than only the end state.

### The fix

`place_on` returns `Option<usize>`: the core that owes an SGI, or `None` for a local push. It is
`#[must_use]`, and its callers send the poke off that value. There is now one comparison against
`cpu::id()` in the whole path and its result is the only thing that can drive the poke, so the two
answers cannot disagree, because there is no second answer to disagree with. That is rung one of
CLAUDE.md's ladder rather than a comment asking the next caller to be careful.

`irq_notify` already worked this way and was the model: it takes `wake_load_aware`'s `Option<usize>`
out of the critical section and pokes whatever it names. `wake_load_aware` now calls `place_on` for
both sides instead of open-coding the local push beside it, which deletes the last duplicate of the
comparison.

### Why a stranded thread usually gets away with it, which is the whole story of the rate

**A strand is not immediately fatal, and that is why this took six weeks to surface.** The inbox is
drained wholesale: the *next* SGI anyone sends to that core, for any reason, sweeps up whatever is
sitting there. So a missed poke is normally repaired within milliseconds by the next unrelated
placement, steal or device wake aimed at the same core, and nothing is ever seen.

It wedges only when the strand is the **last thing that happens**: the stranding placement is the
work the rest of the machine was about to wait on, so no further SGI is generated, and the system
goes quiet holding one runnable thread nobody will look at. That is exactly the CI dump. Main
spawned the consumer, blocked on its verdict, the producer blocked sending to a consumer that never
ran, and there was no other traffic left to poke core 2.

So the frequency of the *bug* is the frequency of the strand, and the frequency of the *hang* is the
much smaller frequency of a strand landing on the last placement before the machine idles.

### How it was proved, since one CI dump is not an experiment

Milestone 72's method again, and with its correction: **a call-free delay loop, not a yield loop.**
An early attempt held the window open with `yield_now()` and only produced a livelock, because a
yielding thread goes back on its own core's run queue and `schedule()` hands it straight back; a
steal needs the thread to be *queued while something else runs*. A plain spin does that and the
first attempt at the plain spin worked.

With a 300,000-iteration spin between `spawn_on`'s two reads, on riscv64 under `-cpu rv64`, the
window is crossed roughly **8 times in 100 `spawn_on` calls** rather than never, and both directions
show up in the log:

```text
[WINDOW] spawn_on tid=0x300000007  migrated cpu 0 -> 3 target=2: benign  (crossing 3 of 70 calls)
[WINDOW] spawn_on tid=0x3d00000005 migrated cpu 1 -> 0 target=1: STRANDS (crossing 17 of 133 calls)
```

`benign` is the harmless direction (a spurious SGI to a core that has nothing waiting). `STRANDS` is
the fatal one: the spawner read the target as its own core, then moved, so the push went remote and
the stale answer skipped the poke.

**The A/B, same widened build, one line of logic apart:**

| | Pre-fix (`remote` from the stale read) | Fixed (`remote` from `place_on`) |
|---|---|---|
| `STRANDS` crossings | 2 | 2 |
| `smp::a_batch_of_cpu_bound_work_reaches_every_core` | **FAILED**: `migration workers never drained (46/48 done)` | **ok** |

**Two strands, two missing workers, out of forty-eight.** The count of lost work equals the count of
stranded placements, which is the strongest form this evidence comes in: not "the symptom went
away" but "the arithmetic matches". (Both arms later die on `no initrd region`, which is an artifact
of driving `cargo test` directly instead of `cargo xtask test`, and hits both arms equally.)

**Without the widener the local rate is zero and the null result has a denominator.** On a quiet
8-core host, and again under ten host burners, the instrumented suite crossed the window **0 times
in more than 1,600 `spawn_on` calls and 400 `start_thread_control_block` calls across five runs**,
and every run passed. The window is a handful of instructions of wall clock, so what opens it is a
host descheduling a vCPU inside it. CI's small shared runners emulating four harts are where it is
widest, which is where the sighting arrived; a laptop with cores to spare is close to the worst
place to look for it.

**Do not read "only `rv64` failed, four other models passed" as an `rv64` property.** Each model
gets exactly one run per matrix, so a race at any rate below about 20% produces a one-model failure
most of the time it appears at all. Milestone 72's entry makes the same point from the other side,
counting six riscv64 rolls of the dice to one aarch64 roll per pull request. Nothing in this bug is
architecture-specific: `sched.rs` is portable code and both callers were wrong on all three targets.

### The general lesson, and it is the same shape as the one above

**A decision made under a lock and re-derived outside it is two decisions.** The first entry's
lesson is that a call returning `Err` may still have acted; this one's is that a *value* read inside
a critical section and recomputed outside it is not the same value, however identical the expression
looks. When a critical section decides something the code after it needs, carry the decision out as
a value. `Option<usize>` and `#[must_use]` cost nothing and make the stale re-read unspellable.

## Tests that guard this

- `smp::a_batch_of_cpu_bound_work_reaches_every_core`, `smp::work_can_be_placed_on_every_core`:
  placement and stealing fill the machine.
- `smp::a_migrated_kernel_thread_keeps_its_hart_pointer`: the tp invariant under forced migration
  (a no-op on aarch64, a real check on RISC-V via `sscratch` ground truth).
- `sched::a_finished_thread_is_reaped_and_its_memory_returned`,
  `user::a_dead_user_thread_frees_its_whole_address_space`: reaping and exact frame accounting under
  cross-core reap lag (the latter waits the lag out rather than reading the instant the count drops).

**No test guards the missed-SGI bug above, and that is deliberate.** Its trigger is a work steal
landing inside a handful of instructions, which no test can schedule; a test that tried would be a
flake pretending to be a guard, and the suite already has the honest instrument for it in the
no-progress heartbeat. The guard is `place_on`'s return type and its `#[must_use]`, which is rung
one of CLAUDE.md's ladder for the part it can reach: a caller now has to be *handed* the answer
rather than derive it, and dropping the answer on the floor is a warning, which CI's `-D warnings`
makes a failure. What it cannot stop is someone writing a fresh `target != cpu::id()` beside it,
which is why `place_on`'s doc comment says out loud what that costs.

### A found flake, fixed: a per-CPU test was asserting an affinity nothing promised

Found while running the gates for milestone 35, on a tree whose diff cannot touch scheduling
(`#[cfg(kani)]` harnesses, the DMA validator's layout constants, and the IOMMU domain builder), which
is what made it clearly pre-existing rather than a regression.

`kernel::cpu::tests::boot_cpu_percpu_is_reachable` opened with `assert_eq!(id(), arch::boot_cpu_id())`,
so it asserted **the test case is executing on the boot core**. On aarch64 `boot_cpu_id()` is the
constant 0 and `id()` is derived from `TPIDR_EL1`, which each core sets once at boot and which no
context switch saves or restores; so `id() == 1` means the code really was running on core 1, not that
a pointer was stale. Nothing promises otherwise: with four cores online and §28's stealing, a secondary
core may pull the test thread, and then the assertion fails on an affinity the scheduler never offered.

Observed **once in four consecutive full-suite runs** on an unchanged tree (`left: 1, right: 0`), so
roughly a one-in-four flake on this machine, failing the aarch64 half of `script/test` when it fired.

**Resolved by weakening the test to the property its own doc comment always described**, now
`cpu::tests::percpu_is_self_consistent_on_whatever_core_we_run`: `current()` points at `PERCPU[id()]`
and no other block, plus `of(boot)` reaches the boot core's block by index, which is what the
cross-core paths (IPI, stealing) actually rely on. That is true on every core, so it is stronger
coverage rather than weaker: under §28 placement the suite scatters, and the property gets exercised on
several cores over a run instead of only the boot core.

The rejected alternative was **giving kernel test cases boot-core affinity** to keep the original
assertion. It reads like the more rigorous option and is the worse trade: it buys one assertion back at
the price of running the entire suite on one core, which is exactly where the placement bugs §28
introduced would hide. A harness that avoids the scheduler it is meant to test is not a harness. The
general rule this is an instance of: when a test fails because the system legitimately does something
the test did not expect, check whether the *test's* claim was ever promised before treating the
system's behaviour as the defect.

### The bounded-yield tests fail under host CPU contention, and the control says so (2026-07-30)

Recorded so the next person who sees it does not spend the afternoon reading a diff. Several
`kernel::sched::tests` cases wait for something with a fixed number of `yield_now()` calls, or assert
a count has settled: `threads_round_robin` ("thread 2 never ran"),
`an_interrupt_that_arrives_before_the_wait_is_not_lost`, `other_threads_run_while_one_is_blocked`,
`a_finished_thread_is_reaped_and_its_memory_returned`. Under TCG the guest's four cores are host
threads, so a fixed yield budget is really a wall-clock budget in disguise, and when the host is busy
the budget runs out before the work does.

Observed during milestone 37: **three different tests from that list failed across four full-suite
runs**, every one of them in a module that executes before any of that milestone's code exists, which
already ruled the diff out structurally. The confirmation was cheaper than the reasoning:
**unmodified `origin/main`, same machine, same minute, failed too** (a fourth test, the reaper's
count). Meanwhile a QEMU from another worktree had been holding **200% of the host for 43 minutes**.

**Measured again on 2026-08-03**, because milestone 72's confirmation loop ran the recipe that
provokes them: four host burners, riscv64 twenty times, **three failures, all from this list**
(`a_thread_that_never_yields_is_preempted_anyway`,
`a_blocked_waiter_wakes_with_an_error_when_its_endpoint_is_revoked`, and the sibling at
`sched.rs:2709`). 15% under load, 0% quiet. They are distinguishable from a real hang at a glance:
these fail in about 23 s with a named assertion, a lost wakeup fails at 60 s with a thread dump.

Two things follow. A run that fails one of these is not evidence about the branch until it has been
seen on a quiet machine or contradicted by a control run, and a control run costs ten minutes and
settles it. And the standing fix is the one this file already argues for elsewhere: these bounds
should be **progress-based or wall-clock with slack**, not a yield count, because a yield count
measures the host's spare capacity and calls it the scheduler's behaviour.
