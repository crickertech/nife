# `no_std` and bare metal

## The standard library is three crates, not one

| Crate | Needs | Gives you |
|---|---|---|
| **`core`** | nothing at all | `Option`, `Result`, iterators, slices, arithmetic, atomics, `core::fmt` |
| **`alloc`** | a heap | `Vec`, `String`, `Box`, `BTreeMap` |
| **`std`** | **an operating system** | `File`, `TcpStream`, `thread::spawn`, `Instant::now`, `println!` |

Everything in `std` is ultimately implemented by making a **syscall** into Linux, macOS,
or Windows.

## Why the kernel can't use `std`

Because there is nobody to call.

`File::open("foo.txt")` compiles down to "execute a syscall instruction and let the
operating system handle it." In our kernel, **we are the operating system.** There is
nothing beneath us to answer. The call would go into the void.

`#![no_std]` means: *do not link the standard library, link only `core`.* That is exactly
what the `none` in `aarch64-unknown-none-softfloat` is telling the compiler.

## The four things you feel

**`#![no_std]`**: no `Vec`, `String`, `Box`, `HashMap`, `println!`, `File`.

**`#![no_main]`**: In a normal program `main` is *not* the first thing to run. The C
runtime (`crt0`) runs first: sets up the stack, initializes libc, builds `argc`/`argv`,
*then* calls `main`. There is no libc here and nobody has set up a stack. So there can be
no `main`. We write our own entry point, `_start`, in assembly, and it sets up the stack
itself.

**`#[panic_handler]`**: `std` provides one, so you've never had to think about it.
Without `std` you must write it, and it forces a real question: what *should* happen when
a kernel panics? There's no process to kill, no stderr, no shell to return to. It's your
call. In nife: print to the serial port, then halt the CPU forever.

**No `println!`**, so we write our own. The good part: the hard bit of `println!` (the
whole `{:?}` / `{:x}` / width-and-padding formatting engine) lives in **`core::fmt`**,
which we still have. All `std` contributed was *where the bytes go*. Implement one trait,
`core::fmt::Write`, with one method that pushes bytes at the UART, and the entire
formatting machinery comes along for free.

## The point

`no_std` is not Rust with the training wheels off. It is **Rust with the assumption of an
operating system removed**. And we are the ones building the operating system.

So every missing piece of `std` is something we **earn back by implementing the thing
`std` assumed existed**:

| Missing | Because we haven't built | Earned back at |
|---|---|---|
| `println!` | somewhere for bytes to go | milestone 1, and again at 8 when the console driver left the kernel |
| `thread::spawn` | a scheduler | the scheduler is milestone 6; `thread::spawn` itself is **still `Unsupported`**, and the reason is a design fork rather than a missing service ([thread-spawn-fork.md](thread-spawn-fork.md)) |
| `Vec`, `String`, `Box` | a heap allocator | milestone 4 in the kernel, then **taken back out**: milestone 14 made the kernel allocate nothing after boot, and the heap moved to userspace as `crates/user_heap` |
| `File::open` | a filesystem | milestone 32 (RedoxFS behind a capability FS server), bound into `std::fs` by milestone 27 phase two |

**The heap row is the one worth reading twice, and this table said the opposite until
2026-09-05.** At milestone 4 the kernel did get a `#[global_allocator]`, `extern crate alloc;`,
and a working `Vec`. Milestone 14 then argued the kernel should not have a heap at all and
deleted it, so `kernel/src/` has no global allocator today. Earning a piece of `std` back is
what this note claims and it is still true; what it did not anticipate is that the kernel would
give one back on purpose. See [heap.md](heap.md) and [collections.md](collections.md).
