//! `redoxfs_host`: make, inspect and **recover** RedoxFS images and disks on the host

//! `ls`, `cat`, `xattr` and `extract` are the disaster-recovery half: they open the volume
//! read-only, need no FUSE, no kernel extension, no root and no key, and behave identically on
//! macOS and Linux. `PATH` is always relative to the filesystem root and `..` is refused.
//!
//! **A `VOLUME` is an image file, or a device plus a partition** (milestone 110). With no selector
//! the bytes at offset zero are the filesystem, which is what an image is. With `--partition N` or
//! `--partition-type GUID` the table at offset zero is read first and the filesystem is the one
//! inside that partition, which is what a disk pulled out of the board is. `partitions DEVICE`
//! prints the table so there is something to choose from. **Both flag names are PROVISIONAL.**
//!
//! The selector is **refused on `mkfs`, `put` and `import`**, which are the verbs that open
//! read-write. Recovery never writes, and opening a *device* read-write by accident is a
//! considerably worse mistake than opening an image read-write.
//!
//! `xattr` is deliberately shaped like macOS's own `xattr(1)`: with no `NAME` it lists what is
//! attached, with a `NAME` it writes that attribute's bytes to stdout the way `cat` writes a file's.
//!
//! The logic lives in the library (src/lib.rs) so the round-trip tests exercise exactly what this
//! binary runs. See vendor/README.md for the 0.9.1 pin this is built against, and
//! notes/host-recovery.md for why that pin has to be kept with the backup.
