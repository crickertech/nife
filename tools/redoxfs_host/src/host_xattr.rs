//! Putting an extended attribute back onto a **host** file, which is the last step of a recovery
//! (milestone 57).
//!
//! `std` wraps no part of this. The call is `setxattr` on macOS and `lsetxattr` on Linux, the
//! argument lists differ, and every other Unix spells it differently again (FreeBSD has
//! `extattr_set_link`), so this module is three implementations behind one signature and a fourth
//! arm that refuses honestly on a platform nobody has taught it.
//!
//! **Three properties the callers depend on, and each is a decision.**
//!
//! *Links are not followed.* macOS passes `XATTR_NOFOLLOW`; Linux uses the `l`-prefixed entry point.
//! An extract recreates a symlink as a symlink, so following it would hang the attributes of the
//! link onto whatever the *host* happens to have at the target path today, which is somebody else's
//! file. Linux then refuses `user.*` attributes on a symlink outright, and that refusal is reported
//! rather than hidden (see [`set`]).
//!
//! *A failure is an [`std::io::Error`] carrying the platform's errno*, because which errno it is
//! decides what a recovering human should do. `ENOTSUP` means the destination filesystem does not
//! hold attributes and the answer is to extract somewhere else; `EPERM` on Linux means the name has
//! no `user.` prefix; `E2BIG` means the value is over that filesystem's ceiling. A recovery tool
//! that printed "failed" for all three would be telling somebody at 2am to guess.
//!
//! *Names are bytes.* The store holds bytes ([`filesystem_proto::xattr::valid_name`] refuses only NUL and
//! over-length), and both platform calls take a NUL-terminated C string, so the only conversion
//! needed is the terminator. Nothing here invents a namespace prefix: a tool that silently rewrote
//! `foo` to `user.foo` to satisfy Linux would hand back a file whose metadata does not say what the
//! backup said.
