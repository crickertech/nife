//! Reading a filesystem out of a **partition on a device** (milestone 110).
//!
//! The device here is a file with a real GUID partition table at the front and a real RedoxFS
//! inside its third partition, and every read is a separate invocation of the built binary, which
//! is the same discipline `recovery.rs` keeps and for the same reason: nothing is shared between
//! the writer and the reader but the bytes.
//!
//! **The filesystem is built as an image and then placed**, rather than written through the offset
//! disk under test. That is what makes this a test of the arithmetic: the bytes in the partition
//! were produced by a writer that knew nothing about partitions, so if the offset is wrong by one
//! block in either direction nothing opens. The table is built with
//! `crates/globally_unique_identifier_partition_table`, which is the parser the reader uses, so the
//! one thing this cannot catch is a table both halves agree is wrong; `blank_check_after_run` in
//! xtask closes that by reading a table the *guest* wrote.
//!
//! The layout deliberately has three partitions:
//!
//! - **1, an EFI system partition**, empty. It proves a selector picks a partition rather than
//!   finding the only filesystem on the disk, and that asking for the wrong one fails cleanly.
//! - **2, misaligned on purpose**: it starts at an odd LBA, so its first byte is not on a 4096-byte
//!   filesystem block. The tool must refuse it rather than round it in.
//! - **3, the nife data partition**, holding the filesystem.
//!
//! And one test uses a **320 MiB** device with the data partition past 256 MiB, because that is
//! where the capability is genuinely new rather than cosmetic. See
//! `a_partition_past_the_engines_scan_is_reachable_only_by_name`.
