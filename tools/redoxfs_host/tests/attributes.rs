//! **The attribute half of the recovery witness** (milestone 57): metadata written by the FS server
//! on one side, and back on a real host file on the other.
//!
//! The claim this closes is calef's, and it is the one that decides whether the backup is credible:
//! *if I am struggling to get the data off, the backup has failed at its job.* Before this, the
//! attributes came out of an image as `.nife-attrs/0000002a`, a blob whose owner you had to work
//! out by hand. A Time Machine sparsebundle carries Apple metadata in exactly those attributes, so
//! "by hand" was the recovery story for the part of the backup a Mac needs to make sense of the rest.
//!
//! **Who writes the fixture matters.** It is `fs_server::Server`, the sans-IO core that runs on the
//! board, driven here over a `DiskFile`. Not a second writer in this crate: a reader and a writer in
//! one crate can share a misunderstanding of the format and agree perfectly, which is exactly the
//! trap `recovery.rs` avoids by importing through upstream's archiver. The store is written by the
//! thing that will write it in the field, then a separate process reads it.
//!
//! **A host that cannot hold attributes is a case, not a skip.** If the destination filesystem
//! refuses them, this test asserts that the tool *said so*, loudly and with a count, rather than
//! reporting a clean extraction. DECISIONS §42 is the rule and this is where it is measured: the
//! failure mode that matters is a recovery that looks complete and is not.
