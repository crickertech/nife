# Boolean predicates: the worklist

*An appendix to [`design/naming.md`](../naming.md), which is the rule, and a companion to
[boolean-predicates.md](boolean-predicates.md), which argues it. This file is the census the pass
took on 2026-09-24 and what became of each name. It is a dated record: the counts are from that
day's tree, and a later reader should expect them to drift. The file's stem is a provisional name,
minted 2026-09-24 by the lane that wrote it; naming is an architect's.*

## How the census was taken

Every function returning `bool` in every tracked `.rs` file outside `vendor/`, found by a scanner
that strips comments and strings, follows braces, and reads each signature to its body. Test
functions and helpers inside `#[cfg(test)]` or `#[cfg(kani)]` modules were set aside, since test
names are sentences here. The std overlay under `patches/std-nife/` was added by hand after a grep,
because the scanner skipped `patches/`.

**454 functions returned `bool`. 434 were not test code, and 316 of those did not begin with
`is_`, `has_`, `can_` or a std relation name.** Reading each doc comment sorted the 316:

| Class | Scanned | Std overlay | What happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| Renamed, the rule applied as written | 87 | 3 | the table below; 734 sites in all |
| A word needs choosing, so an architect's | 9 | 1 | [What needs an architect](#what-needs-an-architect) |
| Fits already: a finite verb phrase or a quantifier | 57 | 0 | [Fits as written](#fits-as-written) |
| Exempt: an action that reports whether it worked | 162 | 1 | [Actions](#actions) |
| Exempt for another reason | 1 | 1 | [Other exemptions](#other-exemptions) |
| **Total** | **316** | **6** | |

The counts are functions, so a name defined once per architecture counts three times. "Sites" is
every occurrence the rename rewrote: definitions, calls, doc links, falsification patches and notes
that describe current code. Roadmap blocks, decisions and mutation-testing measurements keep the
names they were written with, per the rename procedure.

Intel's mnemonic `RDSEED` stays where it names the instruction, the CPUID bit, or Linux's `rdseed` flag; `draw_rdseed` became `draw_random_seed` in the same change |

## What needs an architect

Each of these answers a question, so the rule covers it, but adding `is_` to the existing words
does not produce a name that reads. Choosing the words is a naming decision. All are function
names inside one crate or program, so each is cheap to change later.

| Now | Defined in | Visibility | Recommended | Why a word changes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `check_descriptor` | `crates/dma_validator` | pub | `is_descriptor_allowed` | `check_` reads as an action; the function only answers |
| `one_queue_invariant` | `crates/inter_process_communication` | pub | `one_queue_invariant_holds` | a noun phrase; the verb form keeps the invariant's name visible in Kani harnesses and two patches |
| `same_bytes` | `crates/grant_plan` | private, `const` | `bytes_eq` | std's `*_eq` shape (`ptr_eq`, `addr_eq`); a `const` helper because `==` on slices is not `const` |
| `shift` | `crates/video_terminal` (`Modifiers`) | pub | `is_shift_held` | `is_shift` does not parse |
| `reverse` | `crates/video_terminal` (`Attributes`) | pub | `is_reverse_video` | `is_reverse` reads as a direction |
| `translate_as_el0` | `kernel/src/arch/aarch64/mmu.rs` | private, `unsafe` | `can_el0_access` | named for the `AT` instruction it issues; the answer is about access |
| `aarch64`, `riscv64`, `x86_64` | `xtask/src/suite.rs` (`ArchLegs`) | pub(crate) | `includes_aarch64` and so on | `is_aarch64` would be false for `All`, which also answers yes |
| `no_capability` | `patches/std-nife/overlay/std/src/sys/fs/nife.rs` | private | `is_missing_capability` | `is_no_capability` does not parse |

If calef says no to any of these, the name stays as it is and this table records the refusal.

Each of these, and `removed` and `asked` below, carries a `/// Name: provisional` marker naming the
recommendation, so it queues on `script/names --unratified` with every other unratified name
(calef's standing direction, 2026-09-24). The std overlay's `no_capability` carries one too and
does not show: `script/names` skips `patches/` on purpose, so that entry is visible only here.

## Fits as written

A finite verb or a quantifier already says "this is a question" (see
[boolean-predicates.md](boolean-predicates.md#why-a-verb-phrase-is-allowed)). The 57, by name:

`allows` (twice), `survey_includes`, `denies_all`, `carries_len`, `takes_name`, `mutates`, `fits`
(twice), `is`, `matches_with`, `opens_with_a_literal_dot`, `overlaps` (twice), `overlaps_ram`,
`all_distinct_ids`, `all_distinct_names`, `any_core_running_real_work`, `file_name_fits`,
`component_fits`, `was_already_up`, `status_says_okay`, `repeats_newest`, `stack_works`,
`holds_block`, `holds`, `holds_the_system`, `selects`, `kernel_refuses`, `progenitor_refuses`,
`grant_allows`, `udp_grant_allows`, `runs_after`, `page_is_clean`, `pwd_is`, `userspace_ran`,
`reached_the_goal`, `user_can_read` and `user_can_write` (twice each), `asid_tagging_is_trusted`,
`calibration_has_converged`, `would_violate`, `machine_has_no_device_page_for_the_console`,
`machine_has_no_rtc`, `machine_has_no_entropy`, `had_step`, `page_contains`, `has`, and in
`xtask` `the_disk_agrees` (twice), `kernel_wrote_during_boot`, `redoxfs_reads_back`,
`shell_navigation_landed`, `redoxfs_subtree_was_confined` and
`redoxfs_glob_grant_took_exactly_the_match`.

## Actions

These do something and return whether it worked, which is std's `HashSet::insert` shape, so the
rule does not apply and the verb stays. By place:

- **`xtask`, 71**: every build, boot and gate entry point (`test`, `bench`, `uefi_boot`,
  `swish_check`, `mkredoxfs` and the rest) returns whether it passed.
- **kernel, 36**: `disable` (three architectures), `claim`, `register_space`, `record_mapping`,
  `take_ipc_aborted`, `take_need_resched`, `check`, `check_armed`, `kill_thread`,
  `mark_current_fp_live`, `strand_reply_caller`, `bind_tick_routes`, `spawn_into`,
  `arm_for_start`, `enable_for_current`, `place_bars`, `adopt`, `reclaim`, `release`, `asked`,
  `serve_shootdown_nmi`, the trap bodies and `dispatch_on_interrupt_stack` (three architectures
  each, and also `extern` symbols), and the test drivers `until_the_tick_is_raised`,
  `wait_for_report`, `reclaim_within_two_seconds`, `pool_came_back`, `real_single_hart_or_skip`
  and `spawn_os_primitives_benchmarker`.
- **components, 22**: block and entropy I/O (`read_at`, `write_at`, `read_span`, `fill`,
  `refill`, `read_primary`, `reseed_and_wait`), process building (`build`, `fire`, `reap`,
  `spawn_stage`, `reclaim`, `map_page_frame`), and `push`, `page`, `handle_byte`, `removed`,
  `rederive_one` and `wait_for_fault`.
- **crates, 23**: `push` (twice), `keep_smallest`, `descend`, `ascend`, `step`, `encode`,
  `sector`, the `Pages::page` trait method, `remove_sender`, `remove_receiver`, `take_aborted`,
  `claim`, `grow`, `map_page_frame`, `memory_region_destroy`, `start_child`, `fill_entropy`, and
  virtio's `init_with_features`, `wait_rx`, `blk_flush` and `complete_flush`.
- **elsewhere, 10, and one in the std overlay**: `fixtures` (`start_child`, `write_marker`, `destroy_with_retry`),
  `uefi_loader` (`write_back`, `write`, `flush`, `paint_handoff`), `std_exerciser` (`udp_ok`,
  `tcp_echo_ok`, which perform the round trip they name), `redoxfs_server`'s `grow`, and the std
  overlay's `grow`.

**`removed` and `asked` are the two worth a second look.** Both read as participles and both act:
`removed` sends an unlink and `asked` prompts and reads a reply. A reader could take either for a
question. They are named for what they do, which the rule allows, and a name like `remove` or
`ask_to_confirm` would say so more plainly. That is a naming choice this pass did not make.

## Other exemptions

- `page_frames`'s private `get(i)` on its bitmap follows C-GETTER's `get`, like `Cell::get`.
- The std overlay's `Permissions::readonly` is std's own method name, which the overlay implements.
- `exception_body`, `riscv_trap_body` and `x86_trap_body` are counted as actions above, and are
  `extern "C"` symbols that assembly calls by name, which would hold them even if they were not.

## BUGS

- **The class counts are a reading, not a measurement.** The scanner found the 316; sorting them
  into question or action meant reading each doc comment, and a function whose comment is wrong
  about what it does is sorted wrong.
- **The action counts are approximate by a few**: some helpers straddle (a check that prints its
  verdict is both), and each was put where its doc comment's verb pointed.
- **Nothing keeps this file current.** It records one pass. A new predicate is held to the rule by
  review, not by this table.
