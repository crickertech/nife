# Performing a rename: what moves

*An appendix to [`design/naming.md`](../naming.md), which is the rule. This file holds which
occurrences of a ratified name move and which stay, the refusal-count gate, and the habits that keep
a sweep from rewriting a record. It exists to verify or challenge the main page. A reader who only
needs to name, ratify or rename something should not have to open it. The directory
`design/naming/` and this file's stem are provisional names, minted 2026-09-24 by the lane that
split the file; naming is an architect's.*

## Performing a ratified rename

`AGENTS.md` carries the three rules. This is the argument, the worked example and what is not
gateable. (Corrected 2026-09-24: since §155 (the naming conventions move out of the constitution)
the three rules live in [`design/naming.md`](../naming.md#performing-a-ratified-rename), and
`AGENTS.md` keeps only the authority.)

The asymmetry is what makes this worth writing down. A rename is trivial mechanically and expensive
in every other way, which the *move fast on what can be undone* tenet already says. What it does not
say is that the expensive half is not only the name in a reader's head. It is the records. A sweep
edits those at the same cost as it edits code, while destroying something a revert cannot restore.

### What a ratified name drags with it, and what it does not

A name is ratified for a crate, a program or a module. Some other things in the tree carry that
word, and the question is which of them move with it. calef ruled both halves on 2026-09-18, during
the names review that performed six renames.

| Carries the name | Moves? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The crate directory, package name, dependency entries | **Yes** | They *are* the name |
| A **note named for the crate** (`notes/asids.md`, `notes/gpt.md`) | **Yes** | A note is an interface: a reader meets it by name, and `script/apropos` and every citation address it that way |
| A **note named for the concept or for another thing** (`notes/ipc-naming.md`, about inter-process communication; `notes/ipc-tables-lock-inventory.md`, about the `IPC_TABLES` lock §118 (the `Scheduler`/`SCHED` rename) named) | **No** | The ownership test below: it keeps its name when our crate is deleted. The earlier wording of the row above said only "a note filename", and read that way it would have renamed both of these |
| A **roadmap slug** (`design/roadmap/15-asids.md`) | **No** | Exempt, standing rule: roadmap titles and slugs are drafts, and the number is what people cite |
| A **hardware field or wire name** (`satp.ASID`, `NVMe 1.4` section 3.1) | **Never** | A citation of somebody else's specification |
| A **public type named for the acronym** (`Gpt`, `Dtb`) | **Yes** | calef, 2026-09-19: a reader meets the type far more often than the crate, so leaving it short leaves most of the acronym in place. `Nvme` had already moved with its family. **`Guid` stays** under its own 2026-09-13 ruling, which is about byte order rather than length |
| A **fuzz target named for the crate** (`gpt_table`, `dtb_walk`) | **Yes** | calef, 2026-09-19: named for what it fuzzes |
| A **`BUILT` block, a transcript, a dated account** | **Never** | The [status table](#status-decides-what-moves-not-directory) below |

The note half has a cost the crate half does not: every citation of the old path breaks.
`notes/gpt.md` was cited by 18 files when it moved. `script/lint` check 4c verifies that a markdown
*link* target resolves, so it catches those. It does not catch a path written in prose outside a
link, and both forms exist in this tree. Grep for both. (Corrected 2026-09-24: `script/lint` no
longer numbers that check 4c. It is the block headed "markdown links and the notes index".)

The relative depth is where it actually goes wrong. A citation from `design/roadmap/*.md` reads
`../../notes/...`, and one from inside `notes/` is a bare sibling with no directory at all. Moving
`notes/naming.md` to `design/naming.md` on 2026-09-18 rewrote 65 citations correctly. It still left
one sibling link broken, because the grep that found the others could not see a path with no
directory in it.

Filenames under `notes/` and `design/` are hyphenated, per the domain table in
[`design/naming.md`](../naming.md). So a `snake_case` crate becomes a hyphenated note:
`address_space_identifier` and `address-space-identifiers.md`.

### The refusal count is the gate, and it is one command

Take `script/names | tail -3` before the rename and again after. The refusal count must not move. A
rename neither adds nor removes refusals, so any change is a mistake: a refusal swept into a name
that no longer exists, or one reformatted out of the block the parser reads.

It is sharper than reading the diff. It is the only thing that would have caught the 2026-09-18
incident, where a maintainer reformatting a `Name:` block pushed three refusals out of the parsed
paragraph. The tree-wide count fell from 171 to 168. Nobody was reading for that; the number was
what spoke. The first performed rename under this procedure (`capability_demo_protocol` to
`capability_witness_protocol`) held at 273 across the change, which is the result to expect.

Contributed by that lane, which was asked what the next rename should do differently and answered
with this first.

### Enumerating is cheap; classifying is the whole cost

Hand the next lane the classification, not the file list. The same lane measured it: enumerating 27
occurrences across 16 files took two minutes, and deciding whether one line was an account or a
pointer took twenty. A larger rename has proportionally more of the second and not much more of the
first. A brief that supplies the list and stops has helped with the cheap half.

The case the status table does not cover costs the twenty minutes: a dated account inside a live
document. `design/roadmap/proposals/`'s refusals proposal is `PROPOSED`, so the table says it moves.
The specific sentence in it recorded three measured counts, taken against a crate under the name it
had that morning. So that sentence is evidence and stays. Read the paragraph, not the heading. The
resolution is to keep the old name and add a clause saying why, which is what that file now carries.

### The ownership test: does it keep its name when our crate is deleted?

If yes, the name is not ours and does not move. One question settles the class that accounts for
most occurrences in every rename so far.

It kept `satp.ASID` and `TTBR0_EL1.ASID` (fields in two instruction-set manuals). It kept
`crates/pci`'s `CLASS_NVME` and `find_nvme_device` when the `nvme` crate was renamed around them:
`01:08:02` is a class code the NVM Express specification defines, and it keeps that name whatever
this tree calls its driver. Waiting for the renames still to come: `.dtb` is a file format `dtc`
writes and QEMU reads, and `GUID Partition Table` is UEFI's phrase.

The test is ownership rather than subject matter. A thing can be *about* our crate and still not be
named by us.

### Counting is not classifying, and only reading finds the rest

Take the census twice, and read the after-census line by line. The count tells you the sweep ran;
only reading tells you it was right. The `nvme` rename is the worked case: its after-census caught
three sites that every gate had passed, and none was a link, a symbol, or a name any parser reads.
The full account is in
[rename-where-names-hide.md](rename-where-names-hide.md#the-census-is-the-checklist-and-it-is-taken-twice).

### A path is navigation; a name in an account is a claim

A `BUILT` block keeps the old *name*, because it is an account of what was built under it. It does
not keep a broken *path*. The `asid` rename hit this on 2026-09-18: the block of milestone 15
(tagged address spaces) cites the note that moved. The lane updated those citations while leaving
every use of the name itself. The account rule protects names-as-used-then; it does not protect a
link that now goes nowhere.

The test is whether a reader follows it or reads it. A path is followed.

### Expanding an acronym changes what clippy sees

`crates/asid` passed `doc_markdown` for a year. `crates/address_space_identifier` has underscores in
it, so clippy demands backticks, and three doc comments failed `-D warnings` on text nobody meant to
touch. Every acronym expansion under §154 (the acronym test) will hit this, because every expansion
introduces underscores where there were none.

Backtick every `crates/<name>` inside a `///` or `//!` before running the gate, rather than
discovering it when the gate is red and the diff is large.

### A sweep on `name::` does not catch `](name)`

`kernel/src/arch/riscv64/mmu.rs` carried an intra-doc link whose target was the bare crate name. A
sweep looking for `asid::` never saw it, and no gate reports it: rustdoc warns only when it runs,
which is not on every build. It is the stale-pointer-upgrade class one level down, so grep
`](<name>)` as its own pass.

### `components/` is a second workspace, and `cargo check` is blind to it

The main workspace's check does not compile `components/`. So a rename that breaks a consumer there
is green until something builds it. `gpt` has consumers in it (the `gpt` rename built and ran them).
`dtb` has none, which this line wrongly said it had until the `dtb` lane checked with `git grep`.
`asid` had only the kernel, which is why the first three renames never exercised this. Build both
workspaces, or run `script/test`, which does.

Corrected 2026-09-24: `components/` is not a second workspace. It has been a member of the root
`Cargo.toml` workspace since the split of milestone 175 (split `user/`) (`a146a173e`, 2026-09-13),
before this section was written. What is true is that the host-side gates exclude it (`script/lint`
passes `--exclude components --exclude fixtures`) and build it only for the kernel's targets. So a
host `cargo check` still misses it, and the advice to run `script/test` stands.

### Two mechanical tells worth ten seconds each

`git status` must say `R`, not `A`. A crate rename moves a directory, and
`RM crates/old -> crates/new` is what you want. An `A` means the directory was copied rather than
moved. That is how 757 lines of duplicate source once sat outside every workspace and surfaced only
as a stray `script/names --unratified` entry
([rename-where-names-hide.md](rename-where-names-hide.md#a-crate-copied-rather-than-moved-is-invisible-to-every-gate-but-one)).

Never let a sweep near a `Name:` block's `replacing` clause. `perl -pi` will eat the very sentence
that records what the name replaced, which is the blind-`sed` scar in miniature. Sweep the code
against a file list you typed out, then open every `crates/*/src/lib.rs` block by hand. That is a
small enough set to read.

### Status decides what moves, not directory

| Kind | Moves? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `BUILT` roadmap block | No | An account of what happened, under the names it happened under |
| Dated audit report | No | Same, and the date is on the file |
| Closed decision | No | What was decided, in the words used then |
| `PROPOSED` proposal | **Yes** | Live intent; a reader picks it up and goes looking |
| `PARTIAL` roadmap block | **Yes** | Its outstanding scope is work somebody will do |
| Any quotation | **Never** | See below |

Same rule the nife rename follows (`AGENTS.md`'s header: older records keep the old name where they
describe the past), at the granularity a person performing a rename needs.

It was got wrong on the first pass of the `manual` rename, 2026-09-13, which is why it is here.
Twelve `design/` files were correctly left alone and three were not, all three `PROPOSED`.
`the-two-unexplained-mutation-scores` carried `manual` at 52% in its title.
`colour-and-the-pager` was about `doc` being unable to page. `fatal-risk-3-against-the-new-number`
cited the crate in a score table. The directory looked like history; the status said otherwise.

Status is a property of the passage, not of the file. The `jh7110` rename found the other direction
of the same error (2026-09-13). `notes/model-attribution-review.md` announces itself as a plan, so
by the table above it moves. Two of its tables do not. They count the crates and programs created
inside one measured commit window, and a crate created in that window under the name `jh7110_trng`
did not exist under any other. Sweeping them made a live plan carry a false measurement, which
nothing checks and no reader can spot.

The same shape hit two more notes. In `notes/proof-retrospective.md`, a captured shell transcript
reading `in no shard: jh7110_trng` was rewritten into output that command had never produced. In
`notes/unsafe-obligations.md`, a block count measured against a named base commit was restated
under a file name that commit does not contain.

So read the paragraph, not the heading. A live document routinely contains dated accounts, and a
dated account routinely contains pointers that must still resolve. The repair in all three cases was
the one this section prescribes: restore the measured name and put a sentence beside it saying what
the thing is called now.

### A quotation never moves

Put a note beside it saying the thing was named differently when it was measured, so a number stays
traceable to the run that produced it.

This is the tree's oldest naming scar. A blind `sed` swept a rename across the tree and rewrote the
very row recording that a name had been *refused*. The refusal it destroyed was the one that would
have prevented the rename. Milestone 115 (the names that were ratified) and `script/names` exist
because of it.

### Enumerate before sweeping

The match count is not the rename. Renaming `crates/manual`:

- 89 files matched the word
- 37 were the crate, its note or its program
- The rest were the English word ("manual resume", "not intended for manual editing"), a captured
  boot log (`vf2-2026-09-01-manual-boot.log`), and `manual_let_else`, a clippy lint in the root
  `Cargo.toml` a sweep would have silently broken

List the true positives, read them, then edit. `git grep -l` over a narrowed pattern is the whole
technique, and the cleverness is the hazard.
