# 413. What a `caretaker` is, when the thing it holds is not the thing it hands out

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Promoted from the proposal `what-a-caretaker-is-when-it-translates`, filed
2026-09-14 by the milestone 292 lane while naming the program that puts a file behind a byte sink,
which had been `ROLE_FILE` inside a three-role binary and so had never needed a name of its own.
*(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**Gate: DECISION.** The decision is
[§186](../decisions/186-what-a-caretaker-is-when-it-translates.md) *(number provisional)*, written
up 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice-c lane because this gate named no section. That section also
records why the three sections a reader might stop at do not answer this one: §92 decides a
caretaker's *lifetime*, §56 assumes definition A rather than choosing it, and §106 takes the
`terminal_sink_caretaker` narrowing as a behaviour rather than as a name.
`caretaker` is a word five programs already carry and every future narrowing
program will reach for, so this is a name and names are calef's. It is cheap to settle and expensive
to leave, because the next lane writing an adapter will copy whichever neighbour it happened to read.

**Premise re-checked 2026-09-19 and still true.** The tree still carries both definitions:
`fs_file_caretaker`, `fs_subtree_caretaker` and `fs_nameset_caretaker` narrow, and
`terminal_sink_caretaker` translates. `script/names file_sink` still reports the name as
provisional, still records `file_sink_caretaker` as refused on collision, and its own closing
sentence still routes the inconsistency here. Nothing has been ratified since.

## The two definitions, both in the tree, both load-bearing

**Definition A, narrowing.** A caretaker serves *the same protocol its client speaks*, and what it
takes away is authority rather than vocabulary. `fixtures/src/sink.rs` stated it in as many words
before milestone 292 removed the file:

> The `fs_file_caretaker` shape, one contract further out. `fs_file_caretaker` is a caretaker
> because it "serves the same `filesystem_protocol` protocol its own client speaks"; this one serves a
> *different* and much smaller protocol than it speaks, and that asymmetry is the point.

`fs_file_caretaker`, `fs_subtree_caretaker` and `fs_nameset_caretaker` are all definition A. So is
`fs_file_caretaker`'s own header, which reads the word that way.

**Definition B, translating.** `components/src/terminal_sink_caretaker.rs` holds a terminal endpoint
that carries `OP_READLINE` and hands out a byte sink that cannot read. It speaks
`line_editor::proto` on one side and `byte_sink_protocol` on the other, which is definition A's
explicit counter-example, and `kernel/src/user/sink_tests.rs` says so while calling it a caretaker:

> the terminal's sink is a **separate endpoint served by an adapter**, which is
> `fs_file_caretaker`'s shape

calef ratified `terminal_sink_caretaker` over `terminal_sink` on 2026-08-03, so definition B has a
ruling behind it and definition A has only prose. The prose is more precise.

## Why milestone 292 could not settle it

The lane needed a name for the file-behind-a-sink program, and `file_sink_caretaker` was the
consistency answer: the same adapter as `terminal_sink_caretaker`, for a different backend. It was
refused on collision instead, because `fs_file_caretaker` already exists and is a different thing,
and two names a reader must hold apart cost more than the consistency buys. **That is a local answer
to a global question**, which is why it leaves this behind rather than closing it.

The program shipped as `file_sink` (provisional). If definition B is the ruling, `file_sink_caretaker`
becomes the honest name and the collision is a cost to accept rather than a reason.

## What a decision needs to settle

1. **Which definition `caretaker` carries.** If it is A (narrowing, same protocol), then
   `terminal_sink_caretaker` is misnamed and there is a second word owed for the translating shape
   (`adapter` is the word both `sink_tests` and notes/sink-protocol.md already use in prose, and it
   is the word this tree reaches for when it is not naming a file).
2. **Whether `file_sink` should be `file_sink_caretaker`**, which follows from 1, and whether the
   `fs_file_caretaker` collision is tolerable if it does.
3. **Whether `caretaker` should say what it holds or what it hands out.** `terminal_sink_caretaker`
   says both, in that order, and reads well; `fs_file_caretaker` says only what it holds.

## What it does not decide

Anything about `byte_sink_protocol`, which is a wire contract named for what it carries and survived the
2026-09-13 structural-versus-current sweep on its own terms. Nor about `fs_subtree_caretaker` and
`fs_nameset_caretaker`, which are definition A under either answer.

## Index row

`caretaker` is spelled two ways in this tree and both are load-bearing. Under the narrowing
definition a caretaker serves the same protocol its client speaks and takes away authority rather
than vocabulary, which is `fs_file_caretaker`, `fs_subtree_caretaker` and `fs_nameset_caretaker`;
under the translating one it speaks one protocol and hands out another, which is
`terminal_sink_caretaker`, a name calef ratified on 2026-08-03. Milestone 292 needed the word for
the file-behind-a-sink program, refused `file_sink_caretaker` on collision with the existing and
different `fs_file_caretaker`, and shipped `file_sink` provisionally, which is a local answer to a
global question. What a decision settles is which definition the word carries, whether there is a
second word owed for the translating shape, and whether a caretaker's name says what it holds or
what it hands out.
