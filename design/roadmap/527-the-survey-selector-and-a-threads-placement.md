# 527. The `SURVEY` selector, and a thread's placement

**Status: BUILT 2026-09-21.** *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.* **Expect
renumbering**: 524 onward are contested between several in-flight branches, and this lane picked 527
by looking at what was on `main` and at nothing another session can see. The integrator mints the
real number at merge, like every other global name.*)*

Builds the selector calef ruled on 2026-09-21 in the decisions section provisionally numbered 204
(how userspace asks where a thread runs), which amends §150 (how does a thread's CPU time reach
userspace?) inside the window §150 itself named. That section is not on `main` as this block is
written, so it is described here rather than cited, and the citation lands when it does.

**In brief.** `abi::rendezvous::SURVEY` took a cursor and returned three fixed words. It now takes a
**record selector** in the argument that was always a zero, and the third word is the record's. Two
records ship: the run state the method already returned, numbered 0 so that no existing caller
changes, and a thread's **placement**, the cpu it was put on when it started. The placement fact
already existed in the kernel and had no path to userspace, which is what kept the job-mix
supervisor in the kernel.

## The new semantics of the method, which is a syscall-surface change

```text
invoke(cap, SURVEY, cursor, record, 0) -> (next_cursor, tid, word)
```

- **No new syscall number and no new method number.** `SURVEY` is still method 6 on a rendezvous
  capability, and still takes `ENUMERATE` and pointedly not `READ`. What changed is that its second
  argument now means something.
- **x0 and x1 are the frame; only x2 belongs to the record.** The cursor walk and the tid do not
  depend on the selector, so a caller wanting two facts walks the domain twice and joins on the tid,
  and a caller wanting one is unaffected by every record it does not ask for. That is what makes a
  new record cost an existing reader nothing, and it is asserted rather than assumed, because the
  cheap way to build a selector is to let each record drive its own walk and that version makes the
  tids unjoinable while passing everything else.
- **`abi::survey::record::STATE` is 0.** Every caller written before the selector existed passed a
  zero into an argument it believed was padding, so it selects the record it was already reading.
  Backward compatibility on a wire is a claim rather than a hope, so it is pinned by a host test on
  the constant itself and by a kernel test that walks one domain both ways and compares word for
  word.
- **`abi::survey::record::PLACEMENT` is 1**, and answers a cpu id or `record::NO_CPU`.
- **An unknown record is `abi::Error::BadMethod`, refused before the walk begins.** The selector is
  part of the method's name, so an unrecognised one gets the refusal an unrecognised method word
  gets; no new error code was needed, and none was added. It is checked before the walk rather than
  at the point the record is extracted because of exactly one case: against an **empty** domain a
  check at extraction never runs, the walk falls off the end, and the caller is handed `DONE` and
  prints "no threads" when it actually asked a question this kernel does not understand. A plausible
  wrong answer is worse than an error, which is the ruling this tree already made about a counter it
  could not trust.
- **The rights check still runs first.** A holder without `ENUMERATE` gets `NotPermitted` whatever
  record it names, so the selector is never a way to probe which records a kernel answers.

## Why a selector rather than a fourth word

§150 ruled that CPU time would arrive as a fourth return register and flagged that sub-choice as the
irreversible one, to be overturned before milestone 282 (a thread's CPU time, and the `top` it makes
possible) ships or not at all. 282 is NOT-STARTED, so 2026-09-21 was that moment, used as designed.

The deciding input was a forecast rather than an argument about elegance. A register row holds a
fourth word with no new mechanism, and appending one is the fewest moving parts *if the row stops*.
calef expects a third and a fourth fact, which settles it: a mechanism that must be redesigned at
the sixth field is the wrong mechanism at the fourth. The systems that already went through this
agree, and were read rather than recalled: Linux reached **52 fields** in
`/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/stat` behind a pseudo-file, and Zircon reached **41 topics** behind
`zx_object_get_info(handle, topic, buffer, size)`, which is this selector. Nobody grows a register
row.

**What §150 still rules is untouched.** Tick-sampled, per-thread, scheduled on-CPU time is still
what milestone 282's figure means. Only how it reaches a reader moved.

## Placement, and why it is not "where it is running now"

`record::PLACEMENT` reports the core `sched::pick_spawn_target` chose when the thread started.
`sched::spawn_reporting_placement` has handed that fact to the in-kernel job-mix supervisor since
milestone 240 (the soak reports what happened and not where) as a **return value**, which is only
available to whoever did the spawning. A userspace supervisor did not do the spawning, and that
missing path is what kept that supervisor in the kernel.

**It is placement rather than location, and the reason is measured.** Keeping the core a thread is
on *now* means a store in the context switch, which is the hottest line of the hottest function. The
kernel has exactly that field, `Thread::last_cpu`, and it is behind a soak-build feature gate
because shipping it unconditionally cost **5.7% of `ipc_fastpath`'s footprint on aarch64** (5788 ->
6120 bytes), over milestone 132 (the fast path's footprint, and a gate)'s 5% bound, with
riscv64 and x86_64 growing 4.7% and 4.6% behind it. A placement is **one store per thread
creation**, on a path that is cold by definition, so the same information that was too expensive to
keep continuously is free to keep once. `Thread::placement` is therefore unconditional where
`last_cpu` is not, and it is written at `sched::spawn_on` and `sched::start_thread_control_block`
rather than inside `place_on`, which is also the wake path.

The cost is recorded where a reader meets the record and in `notes/process-view.md`'s `BUGS`: a
thread stolen onto another core, or woken onto its waker's, goes on reporting where it was placed.

## The online set, which is the one way to misuse this

**The cpu id is a name, not an index.** The online set is not `0..n`: on the VisionFive 2 it is
`{1, 2, 3}`, because slot 0 is an M-mode monitor core with no MMU, and treating the count as an
index put `init` into a parked core's inbox and took three boots to diagnose on first silicon. That
is why `crates/cpu_set` exists, and a record handing userspace a core id is a fresh invitation to
the same bug.

**So the answer, stated rather than left implied: a placement census needs no online mask at all.**
Key a tally by the id the record returns and never iterate a range. The ids a census observes are by
construction a subset of the online set, and that subset relation is asserted in the suite rather
than asserted in prose. A census built that way is correct on both machines.

**What it cannot do is show an online core with nothing on it**, because such a core appears in no
thread's record, and it cannot tell that case from a parked core. Nothing in this tree gives
userspace the online mask, and this record deliberately does not smuggle it out: the mask is a fact
about the machine and a survey answers questions about a domain. That gap is a `BUGS` entry in
`notes/process-view.md` and a proposed milestone below.

## Authority, written where the reader meets the method

§150 already weighed that a viewer holding `ENUMERATE` learns an aggregate about threads it cannot
otherwise name, and accepted it for a continuous CPU-time counter. A placement is strictly less than
what was accepted: **one bounded value out of at most 64, written once and never again**, against a
counter that moves continuously and can therefore be differenced into a timing channel. A viewer
that can already see a tid and a run state learns which of a handful of cores that thread was put
on, and learns nothing whatever about a thread outside the domain it was handed.

That reasoning is in the dispatcher's own comment on the `SURVEY` arm rather than only in a
decisions file two hops away, which is rung three of the ladder applied to an argument a reader
needs at the point they are reading the code.

## What milestone 282 adds, which is the point of building it this way

One constant (`record::CPU_TIME`), one line in `abi::survey::record::is_known`, and one arm in
`sched::survey_supervised`. Nothing that reads `STATE` or `PLACEMENT` is touched, and no register
moves. 282's own block still describes step 2 as *"a fourth word on `abi::rendezvous::SURVEY`'s
return"*; **that sentence is now stale and this lane deliberately did not edit it**, because a
developer does not touch another milestone's block. It is named in this lane's report as an edit the
integrator owes at merge.

## Parity

aarch64, riscv64 and x86_64, proven by the same suite with no scope note, and that was confirmed
rather than assumed. Placement is `sched`'s: `pick_spawn_target` samples two online cpus' runnable
counters and `place_on` enqueues onto the winner, with no line of either under `kernel/src/arch/`.
The seven tests in `kernel/src/user/survey_record_tests.rs` run literally unchanged on all three,
plus the x86_64 UEFI-firmware leg.

## BUGS

- **This moves the growth problem from registers to records rather than abolishing it.** Each record
  layout is still a wire format, and a new record value is as expensive to un-ship as a fourth word
  would have been. What is bought is that adding one requires no change to what an existing reader
  already parses.
- **A reader that wants two facts pays two walks**, and the two walks are separate snapshots of a
  domain that may change between them. The join on tid is safe (a tid that vanished is simply absent
  from the second walk), but a thread born between the walks appears in one and not the other. The
  same `readdir` bargain `SURVEY` already took, one axis over.
- **The record names are provisional**, `record` and `STATE` and `PLACEMENT` and `NO_CPU` alike, as
  is `Thread::placement` and `user_mode_runtime::survey_record`. Zircon calls these *topics*;
  *record* was chosen for being the noun for "the fields you get back" rather than for the thing you
  ask about, but calef names public items.
- **`ps` and `pgrep` still ask only for the state record**, so nothing at the prompt displays a
  placement yet. `ps::collect` is hard-wired to that record, which is why this milestone's tests
  drive the cursor walk directly instead of through the real program's loop, and that is a departure
  from `survey_tests`' discipline worth knowing about before copying it.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 564.** The missing half is milestone 564 (a userspace program cannot learn which
  cpus are online),
  `design/roadmap/564-a-userspace-program-cannot-learn-which-cpus-are-online.md`. A placement census
  cannot show an idle core, and the only way a program can currently guess at the online set is the
  range that is wrong on real silicon. The shape is a machine-description question rather than a
  survey one, so it is not a record and does not belong behind this selector.
- **Recorded.** That `ps` and `pgrep` still ask only for the state record, in this block's `BUGS`.
  Whether a placement column appears, and what it is called, is a naming call as much as a build
  one, and it belongs with milestone 282 (a thread's CPU time, and the `top` it makes possible)'s
  `top` question rather than ahead of it.
- **Recorded.** The per-thread page for the self case, in `notes/process-view.md`'s `BUGS`. The same
  2026-09-21 ruling gave a thread observing *itself* an `rseq`-shaped page rather than a selector,
  because the consumer there is an allocator reading its own cpu on every allocation. Not built and
  not this milestone, and recorded so a reader does not mistake the selector's scope for it.

## Index row

**Built:** 2026-09-21

 `abi::rendezvous::SURVEY` took a cursor and returned three fixed words; it now
takes a **record selector** in the argument that was always a zero, and only the third word belongs
to the record, so the cursor and the tid are the same for every record and a new fact costs an
existing reader nothing. `record::STATE` is 0 precisely so that every pre-selector caller, which
passed a zero as padding, keeps reading what it read; an unknown record is `BadMethod`, refused
before the walk so that a bad selector against an empty domain is a refusal rather than a `DONE` a
reader prints as "nothing here". The one record shipped is `record::PLACEMENT`, the cpu a thread was
put on at start, a fact `spawn_reporting_placement` has held since milestone 240 with no path out;
it is placement rather than live location because the live answer needs a store in `schedule()`'s
switch, which cost 5.7% of `ipc_fastpath`'s footprint and is why `Thread::last_cpu` is soak-gated. A
census keyed by the returned id needs no online mask, which is asserted as a subset relation rather
than promised, and the id is a name rather than an index because the online set is `{1, 2, 3}` on
real silicon. Milestone 282 now adds one constant and one match arm instead of a fourth register.
