# 398. Provenance for the names two programs agree on

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Filed 2026-09-13 as an unnumbered proposal, found by milestone 283's gate
firing on a record nobody knew was there; numbered 2026-09-19 by milestone 433's drain of the
proposal pile. **Premise re-read against the tree on 2026-09-19 and still true.**
`crates/measured_boot/src/lib.rs` still carries the record on `PROGRAM_MEASUREMENTS`, saying in its
own prose that the entry name is provisional and that it "sits outside the four surfaces
`script/names` enumerates", and `script/names` still enumerates exactly those four. Two figures
moved: `--unratified` is **72** deep rather than 97, and the program surface is `components/` and
`fixtures/` rather than `user/src/` since milestone 175. **The cheap half this block asks for first
has a first answer**: `pub const <NAME>: &str` matches **77** times across `crates/`, `components/`,
`fixtures/` and `kernel/`, which is the order of magnitude that decides between a list in
`design/naming.md` and a declared out-of-scope, and it is an upper bound rather than the count,
since not every one of the 77 is agreed between two binaries.
*(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**Gate: DECISION.** The decision is
[§180](../decisions/180-provenance-for-wire-visible-names.md) *(number provisional)*, written up
2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice-c lane because this gate named no section. What counts as a
surface is a scope question, and scope decides how large the worklist calef is handed becomes.
Whether to widen at all is his call, not a lane's.

## In brief

`script/names` enumerates four kinds: a crate (`crates/*/src/lib.rs`), a program (`user/src/*.rs`),
a `script/` entry point, and a Cargo package (any `Cargo.toml` outside `crates/`). The `package`
kind was added on 2026-08-18 because `script/names std_exerciser` had been answering *"neither a
name in the tree nor a recorded refusal"* for weeks about eight real packages, and the note written
at the time is the whole argument for this one too: **a registry with a hole is worse than no
registry, because it answers confidently about the names it happens to cover.**

`crates/measured_boot/src/lib.rs` carries this, on the constant rather than on the crate:

```
/// Name: **provisional**. Under `nifefs`'s `NAME_LEN = 32` with room to spare.
pub const PROGRAM_MEASUREMENTS: &str = "program_measurements";
```

`"program_measurements"` is an archive entry name. The kernel's trust root names it and init reads
it out of the archive at boot, so **it is a string two programs agree on**, which `AGENTS.md` puts
in the expensive, hard-to-reverse category alongside a wire format and an opcode number. It has a
provisional name, its author said so, and `script/names --unratified` has never listed it because
the surface does not exist.

## Why this is the same defect the `package` kind fixed, and why it is worse

A package name is read in a `[dependencies]` list, which is at least inside this repository. A wire
string is agreed between two binaries and is the category `AGENTS.md` says cannot be un-shipped.
The names with the least reversibility are the ones with no record.

It is also not one instance. Candidates, unenumerated, which is the point:

- Archive entry names (`program_measurements`, and whatever else the loader agrees with init on).
- The `*_proto` crates' operation names and error codes, which are already crates and already carry
  blocks *for the crate*, not for the words on the wire.
- Public function and method names, calef's since 2026-08-23, counted by nothing. Milestone 276's
  `BUGS` already records that its naming columns miss them.

## What would have to be decided first

1. **Is a wire string a "name" for this purpose, or is it data?** The argument for yes is that a
   reader meets it and cannot change it; the argument for no is that the worklist would grow by an
   amount nobody has counted, and `script/names --unratified` is already 97 deep.
2. **Where does its block live?** Not in the file's header, because milestone 283 reserved that
   spelling for the file's own one block, and a second one would be unreachable by construction. So
   either a distinct spelling (`Value:`? `Wire:`?) or a different mechanism entirely.
3. **How is the set enumerated?** The four existing kinds are a directory listing or a manifest
   walk. A wire string is a `const` in an arbitrary file, and a scheme that cannot enumerate its own
   surface is the hole this proposal is about, one level in.

**The counting is the cheap half and should come first.** Before widening anything, a sweep for
`pub const <NAME>: &str` and the `*_proto` operation tables would say how many names this actually
is. If it is a dozen, the answer is probably a list in `design/naming.md` and no new machinery. If it
is two hundred, the answer is probably that wire strings are out of scope and the record says so on
purpose, the way `unrecorded` is a first-class answer rather than a gap.

## What milestone 283 did in the meantime

Reworded the `measured_boot` record to say the same things in prose, and to say why it does not wear
the `Name:` header spelling. The record is preserved and is one hop from the constant; what it does
not have is a gate, and this proposal is where that goes rather than into a `BUGS` entry nobody is
measured against.

## Index row

`script/names` enumerates four kinds of named thing (a crate, a program, a `script/` entry point and
a Cargo package) and milestone 283's gate fired on a fifth that carries provenance at the thing
exactly as milestone 115 asks, on a surface nothing has ever listed: `measured_boot`'s
`PROGRAM_MEASUREMENTS` is an archive entry name, so it is a string two programs agree on, which
AGENTS.md puts in the expensive, hard-to-reverse category beside a wire format and an opcode number.
It has a provisional name, its author said so, and `--unratified` has never listed it. This is the
defect the `package` kind was added to fix, and worse: a package name is read inside this repository
where a wire string is agreed between two binaries, so the names with the least reversibility are
the ones with no record, and a registry with a hole answers confidently about the names it happens
to cover. Three things have to be decided first: whether a wire string is a name for this purpose or
data, where its block lives (not the file header, which 283 reserved for the file's own one block),
and how the set is enumerated at all, since the four existing kinds are a directory listing or a
manifest walk and a `const` in an arbitrary file is neither. The counting is the cheap half and
comes first: if it is a dozen names the answer is a list in `design/naming.md` and no new machinery,
and if it is two hundred the answer is probably that wire strings are out of scope and the record
says so on purpose, the way `unrecorded` is a first-class answer rather than a gap.
