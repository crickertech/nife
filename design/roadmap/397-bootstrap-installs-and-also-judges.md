# 397. `script/bootstrap` installs what is missing, and also judges whether the machine is good enough

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Filed 2026-09-13 as an unnumbered proposal by milestone 286's lane, out of
a failure that milestone measured on its own container; numbered 2026-09-19 by milestone 433's drain
of the proposal pile. **`script/bootstrap` was re-read on 2026-09-19. The conflation is unchanged
and the measurement that argued for it has weakened**, which is worth separating. Still true: the
header still promises only that the script installs what is missing, and line 174 still runs
`script/qemu-check`, which judges whether what is present is adequate. Weakened: milestone 287
landed the same day this was filed and gave the Linux arm a source-build fallback, so a Linux box
with a too-old packaged QEMU now builds the pinned one and re-checks rather than exiting 1, which is
the exact container failure the table below was priced against. What is left of the case is the
shape rather than the instance: macOS has no fallback and still exits 1 from inside a provisioning
step, and so does any Linux box where `script/ci-qemu` cannot run. *(Number provisional until the
merge queue lands it.)*

**Gate: DECISION.** The decision is
[§199](../decisions/199-bootstrap-provisions-and-judges.md) *(number provisional)*, written up
2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice-c lane because this gate named no section. That section also
corrects one figure below: the callers that read this exit code are five scripts and **three
separate `- run: script/bootstrap` steps** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, not four callers.
Whether the two jobs split, and if so how the caller asks for one without the other, is a change to a canonical "Scripts to Rule Them All" entry point that `script/setup`,
`script/update` and `script/ci-build` all call. The measuring and the wiring are a lane's; whether
`bootstrap` is allowed to return "installed everything I could, and this machine is still not good
enough" as a *non-fatal* answer is not.

**In brief.** `script/bootstrap`'s own header promises one thing: *"it checks for what is already
present and installs only what is missing, so it is cheap to re-run and safe to call."* It does a
second thing the header does not mention. After installing, it calls `script/qemu-check`, which
asks whether the QEMU on `PATH` is *new enough* to boot this kernel, and exits non-zero when it is
not. Installing what is missing and judging whether what is present is adequate are two different
questions, and they fail in two different ways.

## Why now

Milestone 286 put `script/bootstrap` at the head of the command a developer runs before pushing.
That was calef's ruling and it is right. It also made this conflation expensive for the first time,
because a bootstrap that exits non-zero now ends the whole local tier.

**Measured on that lane's container**: packaged QEMU is 8.2.2, which lacks `riscv-iommu-pci`
(milestone 16b, `DECISIONS §20`). `script/bootstrap` installed nothing, broke nothing, found
everything it looks for present, and exited 1 on the adequacy check. On that machine
`script/ci-build fmt`, `script/ci-build lint` and `script/ci-build image-permissions` all pass
perfectly well; the no-argument path runs none of them.

Milestone 286 made that loud rather than silent, which is the half a lane could fix without a
ruling: the exit now says NO CHECKS RAN, lists the skipped tier out of `script/ci-build`'s table,
and names what is still runnable by hand. The half it could not fix is that the developer still has
to type those by hand on a machine that is merely out of date.

## The options

| | what | cost |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | leave it; the loud message is enough | zero, and the developer on a stale machine keeps typing three commands by hand |
| **B** | `script/bootstrap --no-verify`, and `script/ci-build` passes it | one flag; the caller now decides adequacy, which is a judgement moving to the wrong place |
| **C** | split: `bootstrap` provisions and returns zero when it installed everything it could; a separate adequacy check is its own row in `script/ci-build`'s table | the honest shape, and it changes what a canonical entry point's exit code means, which four callers read |
| **D** | `bootstrap` keeps both jobs but distinguishes the exit codes (say 1 for "could not install", 2 for "installed, still inadequate") | small; callers that do not look still see non-zero, and one that cares can |

**C is the shape this tree already reaches for**, and it is worth saying why rather than asserting
it. An adequacy check is a check: it renders a verdict about the machine, it is cheap, and
`script/ci-build`'s table is now the place a check lives. `script/qemu-check` already exists as its
own entry point, so most of C is wiring rather than writing. Against it: `script/setup` and
`script/update` currently get the adequacy verdict for free, and C must not quietly take that away
from a newcomer running `script/setup` on a fresh machine, which is exactly the reader the check was
written for.

**D is the cheap one and should be priced honestly as cheap.** It does not fix the conflation; it
makes it legible to one caller. If the answer is "not worth a split", D is better than A.

**B is refused unless calef wants it**, because it puts the decision "is this machine good enough"
in the caller, and the caller is a table of checks that has no opinion about QEMU versions.

## What is blocked

Nothing. Milestone 286 shipped, the failure is loud, and the workaround is three commands a
developer can type. This is a sharpness problem rather than a correctness one.

## Index row

`script/bootstrap`'s own header promises one thing, that it installs only what is missing and is
cheap to re-run. It does a second thing the header does not mention: after installing it calls
`script/qemu-check`, which asks whether the QEMU on `PATH` is new enough to boot this kernel and
exits non-zero when it is not. Installing what is missing and judging whether what is present is
adequate are different questions that fail in different ways, and milestone 286 made the conflation
expensive for the first time by putting `bootstrap` at the head of the command a developer runs
before pushing, so a non-zero exit now ends the whole local tier on a machine where `fmt`, `lint`
and `image-permissions` would all have passed. Four options, priced: leave it and let the developer
on a stale machine keep typing three commands by hand; a `--no-verify` flag, which moves the
judgement into a caller that has no opinion about QEMU versions and is refused unless calef wants
it; a split, where `bootstrap` provisions and returns zero when it installed everything it could and
the adequacy check becomes its own row in `script/ci-build`'s table; or distinct exit codes, which
does not fix the conflation but makes it legible to one caller and should be priced honestly as the
cheap one. The split is the shape this tree already reaches for, and its own cost is that
`script/setup` and `script/update` currently get the adequacy verdict for free on a fresh machine,
which is exactly the reader the check was written for. It is calef's because the exit code of a
canonical "Scripts to Rule Them All" entry point is read by four callers.
