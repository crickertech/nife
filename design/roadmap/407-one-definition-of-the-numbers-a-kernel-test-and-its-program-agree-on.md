# 407. One definition of the numbers a kernel test and its program agree on

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Filed 2026-09-14 as an unnumbered proposal by milestone 293's lane, which
reduced one instance of this and then measured the rest of it; numbered 2026-09-19 by milestone
433's drain of the proposal pile. **Premise re-read against the tree on 2026-09-19 and still true,
and the tree's counter-example is still in it**: `kernel/src/user/live_swap_tests.rs` still
re-declares `ROLE_DIRECT`, `ROLE_QUEUED` and `ROLE_HUNG` locally although `crates/swap_protocol`
publishes all three. An independent re-count on 2026-09-19, over `ROLE_*`, `RPT_*`, `F_*` and
`TERM_MAGIC` declared on both sides of a spawn, found **25 kernel/program file pairs sharing 79
constant names**; that is a similar method rather than the same one, so it is not byte-comparable
with the 19 pairs and 76 names below, and what it establishes is that the shape has not shrunk.
**Three crate names in the table have moved** and the work has to read the current ones:
`swap_proto` is `crates/swap_protocol`, `login_proto` is `crates/login_protocol`, and
`components/src/ntp.rs` was split into three programs by milestone 290, so that row's program side
is now `network_time_client` and its siblings. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands
it.)*

**Gate: DECISION.** The decision is
[§205](../decisions/205-crates-for-the-numbers-a-kernel-test-and-its-program-agree-on.md) *(number
provisional)*, written up 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice-c lane because this gate named no
section. The sweep itself is mechanical and a lane could start it today; what it cannot
settle is the crate names, and there is no useful half of this work that does not create one. See
"What a lane cannot decide" below, which prices the two shapes so the question arrives answered.

**In brief.** AGENTS.md rule 7 says anything two binaries must agree on is a crate, never a copy.
**Seventy-six constants across nineteen file pairs are copies**, each held in line by a `// must
match` comment: role numbers, report tags, and report flag bits shared between a kernel test's
wiring (`kernel/src/user/*_service.rs`, `*_tests.rs`) and the program it spawns
(`fixtures/src/*.rs`, `components/src/*.rs`). `login_service.rs` and `login_test_client.rs` alone
share fifteen.

## The measurement

Constants named `ROLE_*`, `RPT_*`, `F_*` or `TERM_MAGIC`, declared **twice** under the same name,
once on each side of the spawn:

| Kernel side | Program side | Shared names |
|---|---|---|
| `kernel/src/user/login_service.rs` | `fixtures/src/login_test_client.rs` | 15 |
| `kernel/src/user/disk_tests.rs` | `components/src/disk_partitioner.rs`, `disk_surveyor.rs`, `redoxfs_server/src/bin/mkfs.rs` | 7, 7, 2 |
| `kernel/src/user/compositor_service.rs` | `fixtures/src/window.rs` | 7 |
| `kernel/src/user/credential_service.rs` | `fixtures/src/credentialer_test_client.rs` | 5 |
| `kernel/src/soak.rs` | `fixtures/src/soaker.rs` | 4 |
| `kernel/src/user/identity_provisioner_service.rs` | `components/src/identity_provisioner.rs` | 4 |
| `kernel/src/user/ntp_service.rs`, `pipeline_service.rs`, `disk_service.rs` | `components/src/ntp.rs`, `swish.rs`, `disk_surveyor.rs` | 3 each |
| six more pairs | | 2 each |

Nineteen pairs, seventy-six names, zero shared definitions.

## Why a comment is not a mechanism

It is rung four of AGENTS.md's ladder for a fact that has a rung-one answer sitting next to it. The
failure it permits is silent and specific: a role number changed on one side spawns a *different*
role, and a flag bit changed on one side makes a test assert against a bit nothing sets. Both read
as a bug in the code under test rather than as a mismatch, which is the same misdiagnosis
`credential_proto::fixture`'s own module doc warns about for the SMB account.

**This is not hypothetical, and the counter-example is in the tree.** `crates/swap_proto` already
publishes `ROLE_DIRECT`, `ROLE_QUEUED` and `ROLE_HUNG` with real doc comments, and
`kernel/src/user/live_swap_tests.rs` **re-declares all three locally anyway** under a four-word
comment. So even where the crate exists, one side was written without it. That is the strongest
argument for a gate rather than a convention.

## Prior art inside this tree

The shape is built and works, twice. `crates/swap_proto` and `crates/job_mix` both publish the role
numbers their two binaries agree on, and `crates/schedule_store` publishes the file names
`session_reviver` and `fs_test_client` both depend on, for exactly this reason and with the reason
written down. Milestone 293 did the same for the credential values three files were copying
(`credential_proto::fixture::PEOPLE`). What is missing is not a design, it is the sweep.

## What a lane cannot decide

**The crate names.** The numbers a kernel test and its test client agree on are not part of any
shipped wire contract: putting `login_test_client`'s six behaviour numbers into `login_proto` would
widen the protocol a real login client is written against with something no real client needs. So
each pair either gets a small crate of its own or a shared one, and both are calef's call. That, and
not the work, is what this waits on.

**Two shapes worth pricing before asking**, because the question should arrive answered:

1. **One crate per pair** (`login_test_contract`, `compositor_test_contract`, ...), which follows
   `swap_proto`'s precedent, keeps each contract readable in one file, and costs nineteen names.
2. **One crate for all of them**, which costs one name and makes the crate a grab bag of unrelated
   numbers, which is the shape §46 and the generic-name rule both push against.

## Where it came from

Milestone 293's lane, which was briefed to "grep the values, not just the constant names" after
the sibling lane on `fixtures/src/sink.rs` (292, unmerged as this is written) found one fact
hand-copied in three files. 293 removed the credential half of
its own instance (three copies of three identity/secret pairs, one of which said in a comment that
it had *chosen* to match another) and left the behaviour-number half, because fixing one pair inside
a hotspot three other lanes were in would have been a partial fix in the worst possible place.

## Index row

AGENTS.md rule 7 says anything two binaries must agree on is a crate and never a copy, and
seventy-six constants across nineteen file pairs are copies, each held in line by a `// must match`
comment: role numbers, report tags and report flag bits shared between a kernel test's wiring and
the program it spawns, with `login_service.rs` and its test client sharing fifteen on their own. A
comment is rung four of the ladder for a fact with a rung-one answer sitting beside it, and the
failure it permits is silent and specific: a role number changed on one side spawns a different
role, and a flag bit changed on one side makes a test assert against a bit nothing sets, both of
which read as a bug in the code under test rather than as a mismatch. It is not hypothetical, and
the counter-example is the strongest argument for a gate rather than a convention:
`crates/swap_protocol` already publishes three role numbers with real doc comments and
`kernel/src/user/live_swap_tests.rs` re-declares all three locally anyway. The shape is built and
works three times over, in `swap_protocol`, `job_mix` and `schedule_store`, so what is missing is
not a design but the sweep. What a lane cannot decide is the crate names, and there is no useful
half of this work that does not create one: these numbers are not part of any shipped wire
contract, so putting a test client's behaviour numbers into a protocol crate would widen what a real
client is written against with something no real client needs. Two shapes are priced so the question
arrives answered: one crate per pair, following the precedent and costing nineteen names, or one
crate for all of them, costing one name and making it a grab bag of unrelated numbers.
