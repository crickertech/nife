# 352. DECISIONS 113's rename reached the code and stopped there

Filed 2026-09-03 as an unnumbered proposal while fixing milestone 133's
block for the same reason; numbered 2026-09-19 by milestone 433. **Premise re-checked and re-measured
2026-09-19 and it holds.** `notes/tcb.md` is still named for a retired word and is still indexed in
`notes/README.md` as "The TCB". Counting only the seven retired spellings that cannot collide with
ordinary prose (`Aspace`, `Tcb`, `TcbPtr`, `EpId`, `TidSet`, `EpFail`, `FreeVas`), and excluding
milestone 158's own block, which is the account of the rename and keeps them: **60 occurrences across
26 files** under `notes/` and `design/roadmap/`. The proposal's 115-across-36 figure also counted
`Untyped`, `Endpoint`, `Frame` and `Tid`, which are ordinary words as well as retired identifiers and
need a reader rather than a grep, so the two numbers are not comparable and neither is the smaller
one a claim that the residue has shrunk.

It is a rename with a decided target vocabulary and no open question.

**What the work is.** DECISIONS §113 (eleven kernel object and identifier names move from contraction
or borrowed jargon to the plain, standard term) was decided by calef on 2026-08-23, after he said the
old names *"are clearly not working"* because he had repeatedly had to ask what they meant. The code
was renamed: `kernel/src/cap.rs` carries `ThreadControlBlock(ThreadId)`.

**The prose was not.** Measured 2026-09-03: **115 occurrences of the retired names across 36 files**
under `notes/` and `design/roadmap/`, excluding §113 itself, which documents the rename and should
keep them. `notes/tcb.md` is still named for a retired word and is indexed in `notes/README.md` as
*"The TCB"*.

**Why it matters more than a normal rename.** §113's whole reason was that a reader meets a name and
cannot tell what it is. Renaming the code and not the prose produces the worst of both: the reader
now meets **two** vocabularies, the identifiers say `ThreadControlBlock` and the explanations say
`Tcb`, and nothing tells them these are the same thing. That is a newcomer cost, which is AGENTS.md's
third principle, and it is measurable rather than a matter of taste.

**Why nothing caught it.** No gate reads prose for retired identifiers. `script/lint` checks that
citations are grounded, that links resolve and that names in `script/names` are ratified; none of
those notice a paragraph using a name the code no longer has. Milestone 252's sweep found the same
shape (*"ten stale claims sit in rustdocs, module headers and notes where no gate reads them"*) and
this is a larger instance of it.

**The blind-sed hazard is on the record and applies here.** AGENTS.md records a rename that swept the
tree and rewrote the very row saying a name had been **refused**. §113 itself must keep the old names,
and so must any passage describing the rename or quoting a transcript from before it. A mechanical
pass needs an exclusion list and a reader.

**Not done here, and the reason is scope**: this was found while fixing two files for milestone 133,
and 36 files is a lane rather than an aside.

## Index row

DECISIONS §113 moved eleven kernel object and identifier names from contraction or borrowed jargon
to the plain, standard term, decided by calef on 2026-08-23 after he said the old names "are clearly
not working" because he had repeatedly had to ask what they meant. The code was renamed and the prose
was not, which produces the worst of both: the reader now meets two vocabularies, the identifiers say
`ThreadControlBlock` and the explanations say `Tcb`, and nothing tells them these are the same thing.
That is §113's own reason for existing, inverted, and it is measurable rather than a matter of taste.
Nothing caught it because no gate reads prose for retired identifiers: `script/lint` checks that
citations are grounded, that links resolve and that names are ratified, and none of those notices a
paragraph using a name the code no longer has. The blind-sed hazard is on AGENTS.md's record and
applies directly, since §113 itself must keep the old names and so must any passage describing the
rename or quoting a transcript from before it, so a mechanical pass needs an exclusion list and a
reader.
