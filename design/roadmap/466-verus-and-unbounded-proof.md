# 466. Verus, and unbounded proof

**Status: REFUSED.** Refused by milestone 18 (design/roadmap/18-verify-capability-core.md), and
recorded there on 2026-09-03. Backfilled here on 2026-09-20 by
milestone 448 (design/roadmap/448-a-refusal-gets-a-number.md), which gave a refusal that names work a number, a
status and a condition that would change it. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**The date is when the refusal was written down, not necessarily when it was made.** Most of this
tree's `- **Refused.**` bullets were written in one sweep on 2026-09-03, so the decision is usually
older than the bullet and its reasoning sits in the block's own prose above it.

## The refusal, in its own words

From '18. Verify the capability core, then spread inward', under `## Follow-on`:

## Why it is here rather than only there

The verification story here is bounded model checking on Rust, taken deliberately as the tractable
path against seL4's Isabelle/HOL refinement proof. Verus is the other available shape: an SMT-backed
verifier that can carry loop invariants and prove properties over unbounded inputs, at the cost of
writing those invariants.

## Revisit

- **Condition.** A specific property that needs a loop invariant, which is the refusal's own
  wording. It is explicitly not work anybody owes: the block keeps Verus as something to revisit when
  a property demands it rather than as a plan, and nothing in the proof suite has demanded one yet.

## Index row

The choice of bounded model checking over unbounded proof is the single largest decision in this
tree's verification story, and it was recorded as a bullet in a block. The condition is a property
rather than a preference, which is the right shape: bounded checking fails at a specific place and
that place is the trigger.
