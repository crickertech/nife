# 124. A thread is born where it lives: the spawn path's copies

**Status: BUILT.** Built 2026-08-14, reopened 2026-08-16 when the same banner came back on both
ISAs, and **closed 2026-08-17 when the banner turned out not to be this milestone's bug at all**.
Minted by calef out of the riscv64 stack overflow milestone 108 was held on. The hold turned out to
be the wrong suspect three times over, and the third time is the interesting one.

**The structural half is built (pull request #248, 2026-08-16) and the status did not move, which
is the honest reading rather than an omission.** A per-CPU interrupt stack now exists on both
ISAs, 16 KiB per core over its own guard page, with the handler chain running there instead of on
whatever thread it interrupted. Three things deliberately stay on the interrupted stack (the trap
frame, a trap from user mode, and the deferred `schedule()`), and the design's one rule, that
nothing on an interrupt stack may context-switch away from it, is held three ways: a
`debug_assert!`, the doc at the thing itself, and **a static CI proof that no context switch is
reachable from the interrupt-stack entry point on either ISA**.

What that buys, stated as the lane stated it rather than as the headline suggests: the static
worst-case bound on a thread stack improved by only 256 bytes (13712 to 13456 on aarch64), because
what remains is `schedule()`'s own chain, which is the cost of scheduling at all and which a
thread already pays to block in `ipc_recv`. **The defensible claim is structural: a preemption now
costs the interrupted thread a trap frame plus the same scheduler tail a voluntary block costs,
and the handler is bounded on a stack of its own.** The measured watermark did not move at all,
because in this suite the deepest byte of every stack is reached by ordinary code rather than by
an interrupt landing on top; that is what a watermark can and cannot say about a rare worst case.

**The reopening's own reason is untouched**, which is why this stays `PARTIAL`: the two faults are
a store at a *fixed address*, not depth, and nothing here explains them. `warn_if_guard_page` now
prints the interrupted `sp` from the frame rather than the live one, which after this change would
have named the wrong stack.

## Reopened: the guard page is being stepped over again (2026-08-16)

The same `*** KERNEL STACK OVERFLOW ***` banner, the same one-page guard, the same test on both
architectures:

- **aarch64**, in a merge-queue run at 01:48Z: slot 87's guard page, `sp` **4096 bytes** past the
  bottom of a 16384-byte stack, panicking at `arch/aarch64/exceptions.rs:630`.
- **riscv64**, in pull request #213's `cpu matrix` job at 22:29Z: slot 102's guard page, **4088 bytes**
  past, on the `rv64` model only, with the other four models green.

Both land in `kernel::user::supervision_tests::a_faulting_child_reports_to_its_supervisor_and_is_
reaped_then_respawned`.

**Three things are already known and are what make this worth reopening rather than filing fresh.**

**It is not any pull request's fault.** The aarch64 failure was a merge-queue candidate whose pull
request is 59 lines of markdown, so it reproduces against `main`'s own content. It had been read as
pull request #213's problem for four hours on that evidence, which was wrong.

**It is intermittent**, which is why the tree stayed green around it: merge-queue runs at 01:52Z and
01:53Z passed on the same base that failed at 01:41Z.

**The depth hypothesis is refuted, by measurement, and it was this block's own first guess.** The
reopening proposed cumulative depth plus an exception frame arriving at the worst moment. A lane
built the instrument this milestone and `notes/stack-high-water.md` had both named as missing, a
call-graph walker (`script/stack-depth-check`), and measured the deepest chain a thread stack can
reach: **13712 bytes on aarch64 and 13344 on riscv64, against a 16384-byte stack** (measured on this
branch, 2026-08-16). **Take these from a run, not from here.** They moved twice in one afternoon,
13792 to 13760 to 13712 on aarch64, purely from merging other people's work; the gate prints them
and the gate is the authority, the graph acyclic, and **no frame over the guard page reachable from any
thread entry point on either ISA**. A
fault at a slot's guard base needs `sp` 20480 bytes in. The deepest watermark ever observed is 10600.

**So the banner was never a measurement.** `warn_if_guard_page` derived every line from the faulting
*address* and then wrote "so sp went N bytes past it", which is a claim about the stack *pointer*
that nothing in it had read. It now prints `sp` beside the address in the same units and leaves the
comparison to the reader. That one sentence is what sent this reopening, and the four hours before
it, after the wrong thing.

**What survives is the evidence the hypothesis was invented to explain.** Six recorded guard-page
faults land on exactly **two addresses**: aarch64 slot 87 (`notes/frames.md`, 2026-08-13, and again
08-16) and riscv64 slot 102 (`sched.rs`'s harness doc ~08-11, `notes/stack.md` 08-14, and again
08-16). Unmoved by #157 and unmoved by this milestone's own rebuild of the spawn path. **Depth
wanders; those do not.** A fixed address is a stray store rather than a stack running out, and the
two candidate mechanisms are in `notes/stack.md` along with what the next occurrence must print to
settle it. One of them is geometry worth knowing: slot `N`'s guard page begins one byte past slot
`N-1`'s last usable stack byte, so a pointer treating a stack top as inclusive lands in a guard page
with `sp` nowhere near it.

**124's own fix comes out stronger than it claimed**: no oversized frame is reachable from a thread
stack at all. Its remaining `BUGS` entry, that the riscv64 overflow was not proven fixed, closes as
*the class it addressed is closed, and this is a different bug wearing its clothes*.

**This stayed `PARTIAL` until the fault was reproduced on a desk, which happened on 2026-08-17.**
The section below is what it was, and it was not a stack overflow of any kind.

## Closed: the stack was freed under its owner (2026-08-17)

**A supervised corpse is published as `Dead` while it is still executing on its own kernel stack,
and an out-of-band reaper on another core is allowed to free that stack.** `depart()` marks the
thread `Dead`, delivers its death message (which wakes the supervisor), releases `SCHED`, and only
then calls `schedule()`. A supervisor that reaps in that window runs
`reap_supervised` -> `reclaim_region` -> `reap_region_objects`, whose refuse phase asks only about
`state`; `Dead` is not `Ready`/`Running`/`Blocked`, so nothing refuses, the `Thread` is dropped, and
`KernelStack::drop` unmaps six pages with a real `tlbi` under a running core.

**The kernel already had the flag that answers this and the reap path never asked it.**
`Handshake::on_cpu` means exactly "a core is standing on this thread's stack" and is cleared by
that core's successor in `finish_switch`, whose doc says in so many words that dropping a `Thread`
"must not happen while any core still stands on it". `finish_switch` obeys it; `reap_region_objects`
reasoned from `state`, and **"never runs again" is not the same as "off its stack"**. The fix is one
clause: refuse while `on_cpu`, without arming a kill, because the thread is already dead and the
refusal clears one context switch from now. Both supervision tests now retry their reclaim, which
is the idiom the same file already used two lines later.

**Reproduced on the desk**, which 45 runs had failed to do, by widening the window in `depart` with
a spin loop: the fault appears on the first run with the delay in and does not appear with the
refusal in. Not committed; the mechanism is recorded instead, and closing the window properly is the
handoff below.

**Three pieces of evidence, and the first two were already in the tree.** The full account, with the
arithmetic, is notes/stack.md, "a kernel stack freed under its owner".

- **The fixed address is forced, not chosen.** aarch64's `SAVE_CONTEXT` walks `sp` down 272 bytes
  per level and stores upward in 16-byte steps, so the terminal store of a cascade lands on the
  guard base *exactly*, every time; riscv64's 8-byte `sd` gives base or base+8, which are precisely
  the two riscv64 addresses ever recorded. notes/stack.md said this on 2026-08-15 and contradicted
  it forty lines later, and the contradiction is what sent this reopening after a stray store that
  does not exist.
- **`ELR_EL1` confirms the walk in all three aarch64 dumps**: `+0x214`, `+0x228` and `+0x234` are
  the 5th, 10th and 13th `stp` of the same-EL synchronous vector entry, and each one's store offset
  puts `sp` in the `[G-256, G)` window the arithmetic predicts. The paragraph that read `ELR` as a
  refutation compared a **CI** address against a **local** build's `exception_vectors`, in a file
  that had already measured the two half a megabyte apart.
- **The fourth occurrence names it.** CI run 31960738448 was the first firing after this milestone
  added the conservative `.text` scan, and the scan took a translation fault on the very first word
  of the slot's stack: **the stack is unmapped**. Nothing overflows an unmapped stack. That fault
  also destroyed `ELR_EL1`, `FAR_EL1` and the new `sp` line before any of them printed, so the
  instrument ate its own report on its first real firing; `stack.rs` now runs the scan last and asks
  `mmu::is_mapped` before each page, which turns the old fault into the most useful line in the
  report.

**Why this test and no other, and why only CI.** `a_faulting_child_reports_to_its_supervisor_and_
is_reaped_then_respawned` is the only place in the suite that reaps a corpse the instant it is told
about one, with four assertions between the `ipc_recv` and the `reclaim_region`. That is a race
between a few hundred instructions on each of two cores: one run in six on a loaded 2-core runner,
zero in 45 on an idle laptop. It is also why no fix moved it. #157, this milestone's spawn-path
rebuild and the per-CPU interrupt stack all changed depth, and depth was never the variable.

**What this milestone's own work is worth, restated honestly.** Nothing here was wasted and nothing
here fixed the banner. `script/stack-depth-check` is the gate that finally *refuted* depth rather
than the one that would have caught this; the frame-shrinking closed a real separate hazard; the
per-CPU interrupt stack is a structural win measured in the interrupt-at-the-worst-instant case.
The banner was a different bug wearing their clothes, for the third time.

**The better fix, deliberately not taken here, wants a lane.** The window exists because a thread is
published as `Dead` before it is off its stack. Marking it `Departing` in `depart` and promoting it
to `Dead` from `finish_switch` (which already holds `SCHED`, and already runs at exactly the instant
the stack is free) would delete the window instead of refusing inside it, and no caller would ever
see a transient refusal. That is a change to the death protocol and to `RunState`, which lives in
`crates/wake_handshake` where loom searches the transitions, so it is a decision rather than a
hotfix.

**The worst `spawn_on` instantiation went from 4592 bytes to 1040**, every one of them now clears the
4096-byte guard page on its own merits, and `script/stack-frame-check`'s ratchet is deleted rather
than lowered.

**Two predictions in this block were wrong, and the corrections are the useful part.** It said the
fix needed `insert_in_place` on `crates/slots` and that reading the Kani harnesses alongside it was
the main cost. **Neither was true**: the table stores a `TcbPtr`, not a `Thread`, because a TCB lives
on its own page. `crates/slots` was never touched and no harness moved. The copies were all between
`Thread::spawn`'s frame and `ptr.write`, so the fix is `Thread::spawn_into` writing through a pointer
the caller already holds, plus `Threads::insert_in_place` to hand that pointer down.

## The number, and why it is the interesting kind of number

**`sched::spawn_on` carries a 4592-byte frame, and the guard page under every kernel thread stack is
4096 bytes.** It is generic over the spawned closure, so every service that spawns gets its own
instantiation: ten of them, 3888 to 4592 bytes, over the guard page on **both ISAs**, measured with
`script/stack-frame-check`.

A frame larger than the guard page is not merely close to overflowing. It can move `sp` from inside
the stack to below the guard **in a single step**, touching nothing in between, so the guard never
faults and the write lands in the neighbouring thread's stack instead. The overflow stops being a
legible fault and becomes corruption that surfaces somewhere else entirely, arbitrarily later.

That is not hypothetical here. On 2026-08-14 a `thead-c906` run faulted **4088 bytes below the stack
bottom** on a 4096-byte guard. Eight more bytes and there would have been no fault at all.

## Where the bytes are, measured rather than guessed

| symbol | frame |
|---|---|
| `sched::spawn_on::<fs_service::spawn_fs_server>` | 4592 |
| `sched::spawn_on::<compositor_service::start>` | 4576 |
| ... eight more instantiations ... | 3888 to 4560 |
| `Thread::spawn::<fs_service::spawn_fs_server>` | 2720 |
| `capability::CSpace<cap::Object, 16>`, one field of `Thread` | 384 bytes of type |

The per-instantiation spread is only about 700 bytes and tracks `size_of::<F>()`, so **the closure is
the small part**. Roughly 3900 bytes is constant, and it is the `Thread` travelling by value.

## What the work was

**This section proposed the wrong fix, and what replaced it is worth reading.** The proposal was
`insert_in_place` on `crates/slots`, on the belief that `Table::insert_with` stored the `Thread`:
`self.slots[slot] = Some(f(name))`, so the closure builds it, returns it, it is wrapped in `Some`,
and then stored.

**The table does not store a `Thread`. It stores a `TcbPtr`**, because a TCB lives on its own page,
and `Threads::insert_at` is where the value actually lands:

```rust
let ptr = crate::arch::mmu::phys_to_virt(page) as *mut Thread;
self.table.insert_with(|tid| { unsafe { ptr.write(f(tid)) }; TcbPtr(ptr) })
```

So `crates/slots` was never touched. The copies were all between `Thread::spawn`'s frame and that
`ptr.write`: build a `Thread`, return it by value, hold it in `spawn_on`, move it into a closure,
return it from the closure, write it. Five hops, each a real memcpy in a debug build, and a debug
build is what CI runs.

What shipped instead:

```rust
// kernel/src/thread.rs
pub unsafe fn spawn_into<F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static>(f: F, id: Tid, dst: *mut Thread) -> bool

// kernel/src/sched.rs
fn insert_in_place(&mut self, build: impl FnOnce(Tid, *mut Thread) -> bool) -> Option<Tid>
```

`Thread::spawn` survives as a thin `MaybeUninit` wrapper over `spawn_into`, because `sched::init`'s
idle thread and `spawn_blocked` hold no TCB page when they build. They keep the copies, and nothing
on their paths is near a guard page.

The decline path is the part to read twice. `insert_at_in_place` mints the name before `build` runs,
so a build that fails has to give it back, and `Table::remove` is the right primitive rather than a
leak: the slot holds a `TcbPtr`, and dropping that drops a pointer. The `Thread` drop lives in
`Threads::remove`, which this path never reaches because no `Thread` was ever constructed.

## A hypothesis that was measured and refuted, kept so nobody repeats it

The first proposal was that the closure's opening `let mut thread = thread;` cost a whole `Thread`
copy, and that deleting the rebind would fix it. **It changes nothing.** Removing it and rebuilding
produced byte-identical frames across all ten instantiations (4592 to 4592, 4576 to 4576, and so on):
the compiler already elides that rebind. The copies are in the value-passing chain, not in the
rebinding, which is why this milestone proposes an API change rather than an edit.

## Why this is not just a stack-size question

Raising `STACK_PAGES` from 4 to 8 would buy headroom and is one number. It is the wrong lever here
for a reason specific to this shape: **the guard page stays one page** no matter how large the stack
is, so a 4592-byte frame can still step over it. Growing the stack moves the overflow further away
without restoring the mechanism that makes an overflow *legible*. Shrinking the frame below 4096
restores it.

Growing the stack is still worth considering on its own merits, and the two are independent.

## What "done" meant, and what it measured

Every `spawn_on` instantiation under 4096 bytes on both ISAs, and the `RATCHET` entry deleted rather
than lowered. Both hold: the worst went 4592 to 1040, and the gate now reports "no ratchet" on
aarch64 and riscv64. The `slots` harnesses needed no reading, for the reason above.

**The independent confirmation is the better evidence.** The icount tripwire failed this branch on an
*improvement*: `spawn_reap` moved 154725 against a 173742 baseline, 10.9% fewer instructions, and
12.9% on riscv64. A benchmark with no idea what changed measured the memcpy that is no longer there.
Both baselines were updated from CI's own numbers rather than computed, and the riscv64 case earned
that discipline: scaling the aarch64 ratio would have written 25382 against a real 24835, which is
both wrong and still outside the tolerance band.

## Prior art

**A design to copy:** seL4 retypes a TCB out of untyped memory *in place*, at an address the caller
names, so there is no "construct then move" step for the same reason this milestone exists. The
object is born where it lives.

**A mistake to avoid:** treating this as a debug-build artifact worth ignoring because release builds
elide the copies. CI runs debug, the guard-page fault is real in debug, and a demonstrator whose
proofs and tests run in a configuration nobody checks is not demonstrating.

## BUGS

- **The prediction that `crates/slots` was the main cost was wrong**, and it is kept here because it
  is the plausible reading of `Table::insert_with` and the next person will make it too. The table
  stores a `TcbPtr`; the `Thread` is on its own page. No harness moved.
- **`Thread::spawn` still carries the copies** for `sched::init`'s idle thread and `spawn_blocked`,
  which hold no page when they build. Nothing on those paths is near a guard page today, and if one
  ever is, this is where to look first.
- **`-Z emit-stack-sizes` measures frames, not call chains**, so "every instantiation under 4096"
  bounds one frame and not the depth of the path it sits in. The watermark in
  notes/stack-high-water.md is the other half, and neither is sufficient alone.
- **The ratchet is gone**, so nothing now holds these frames except the gate's own 4096-byte ceiling,
  which is the state a ratchet exists to reach and then be deleted from.
- **The riscv64 overflow is still unexplained, and this milestone did not prove it fixed.** #157
  fixed the aarch64 one by shrinking `reap_region_objects`; the riscv64 fault was a different chain on
  a different slot, and this was the prime suspect rather than a demonstrated cause. What closed here
  is the separate hazard that ten frames could step over the guard entirely. **If it recurs, the
  call-graph walker is the next instrument and nothing in the tree has one**, which is now the answer
  to "why did we not catch this" twice over.

  **Closed 2026-08-17, and not by this milestone.** It was never an overflow on either ISA: the
  stack was freed under its owner and the vector walked `sp` to the slot base. See the section
  above. The walker did get built and did earn its keep, by refuting depth rather than by measuring
  it.
- **The refusal is a race a caller can still see**, one context switch wide, and it is a
  `NotPermitted` rather than a corrupted kernel. Any caller reclaiming a region that holds a
  just-dead thread must retry; `wait_for` is the in-tree idiom and both supervision tests now use
  it. The window itself is closed only by the `Departing` change above.
- **The `on_cpu` guard is a condition in one function**, which is rung two of AGENTS.md's ladder.
  Rung one would be a type that cannot name a thread still standing on its stack, and this tree does
  not have one. The next out-of-band remover can forget it exactly as this one did.

## Follow-on

- **Recorded.** In `design/roadmap/124-a-thread-is-born-where-it-lives.md`'s own BUGS: the refusal
  is a race a caller can still see, one context switch wide. Any caller reclaiming a region that
  holds a just-dead thread gets a `NotPermitted` and must retry, and `wait_for` is the in-tree idiom
  both supervision tests now use.
- **Recorded.** In `design/roadmap/124-a-thread-is-born-where-it-lives.md`: the `on_cpu` guard is a
  condition in one function, which is rung two of AGENTS.md's ladder. Rung one would be a type that
  cannot name a thread still standing on its stack, and this tree has no such type, so the next
  out-of-band remover can forget the check exactly as this one did.
- **Recorded.** In `design/roadmap/124-a-thread-is-born-where-it-lives.md`: `Thread::spawn` still
  carries the copies for `sched::init`'s idle thread and `spawn_blocked`, which hold no TCB page
  when they build. Nothing on those paths is near a guard page today, and this is where to look
  first if one ever is.
- **Recorded.** In `design/roadmap/124-a-thread-is-born-where-it-lives.md`: the ratchet is deleted
  rather than lowered, so nothing holds these frames except the gate's own 4096-byte ceiling. That
  is the state a ratchet exists to reach and then be deleted from.
- **Recorded.** In `notes/stack-high-water.md`: `-Z emit-stack-sizes` bounds one frame and not the
  depth of the path it sits in, so "every instantiation under 4096" and the watermark are each half
  an answer and neither is sufficient alone.
- **Recorded.** In `design/roadmap/124-a-thread-is-born-where-it-lives.md`: the prediction that
  the slot table, `crates/generational_table` (this block's prose still calls it
  crates/slots, its name before the rename), was the main cost was wrong, and it is kept because it is the plausible reading of
  `Table::insert_with` and the next person will make it too. The table stores a pointer; the thread
  is on its own page.
- **Refused.** Raising `STACK_PAGES` from 4 to 8 as the fix. The guard page stays one page however
  large the stack is, so a frame bigger than 4096 bytes can still step over it in a single move and
  the overflow stays illegible. Growing the stack moves the fault further away without restoring the
  mechanism that makes it a fault at all; shrinking the frames below 4096 restores it. Growing the
  stack remains an independent question on its own merits.
- **Unclaimed.** Delete the window in which a thread is published `Dead` while it still executes on
  its own kernel stack, instead of refusing inside it: mark it `Departing` in `depart()` and promote
  it to `Dead` from `finish_switch`, which already holds `SCHED` and already runs at the instant the
  stack goes free. No caller would then see the transient `NotPermitted` this block records as a
  race. It touches the death protocol and `RunState` in `crates/wake_handshake`, where loom searches
  the transitions, so it wants a lane rather than a hotfix.
