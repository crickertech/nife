# 93. Documentation audits as a mechanism: the docs stay true to the tree

**Status: BUILT** 2026-08-16. The mechanism is one row in milestone 92's cadence table, not a second
machine: `documentation` is a kind `script/audits` evaluates, `script/audits --worklist` answers the
scope question this block left open (a heuristic, not a signal, and the reasoning is in
[notes/documentation-audit.md](../../notes/documentation-audit.md)), and the procedure is written
down where a stranger can run it. **The first sweep ran in the same lane**, because a cadence whose
first run has never happened is a plan: it found thirteen environment variables in prose that name
nothing, nine backticked paths that resolve to nothing, a rotted line count, and, most instructively,
a rotted *justification* (`script/lint`'s recorded reason for not gating backticked paths had grown
from 8-of-95 to 31-of-379). Part 3's compounding half is real rather than aspirational: the first
class is now gated by `script/lint`'s `==> environment names in prose` and cannot rot again. Report:
[design/audit-reports/2026-08-16-docs-versus-reality.md](../audit-reports/2026-08-16-docs-versus-reality.md).
Raised 2026-08-03 by calef, as milestone 92's sibling: 92 keeps the
security story from rotting; this keeps every other documented claim from rotting. A
demonstrator's docs are part of the deliverable (CLAUDE.md), so a doc describing a system that no
longer exists is a defect in the deliverable, not a cosmetic lag.

The cadence was decided 2026-08-16 (§74) and this milestone shares it rather than proposing its own: the same triggers read the same tree, because a documentation sweep's input is what changed since the last one. (This block carried **Gate: NONE** until it was built; the gate line is dropped rather than kept, because `script/roadmap` is right that nothing gates finished work.)

**The evidence that rot is real here, all found in one day (2026-08-03):** notes/verification.md
said the proof suite ran in "a few minutes" a month after that stopped being true; two roadmap
status rows claimed more remained than their own blocks said; milestone 47's in-brief listed work
as pending that had shipped; notes/cpu-models.md's closing line prescribed a fix a later milestone
had superseded. Every one was found by accident, while looking for something else. The mechanism
exists so finding them stops being luck.

**What already exists, so this builds on it rather than beside it:** the structural gates catch
structural rot (script/roadmap and script/decisions for citations and status vocabulary, the lint
link check for dead paths, typos for spelling). What nothing catches is **claim rot**: a number,
a count, a "currently", a "still open" that the tree has moved past. The tree's own habit points
at the fix; its best documents already say "counted by grepping, not by memory" next to their
numbers.

**The mechanism, mirroring 92 where the shape is the same:**

1. **Cadence and tripwire**: same pattern as 92 (a recorded schedule, an index file, an overdue
   signal in the toolchain-drift style). If 92 lands first, share its index and tripwire
   machinery rather than growing a twin; one audit index with a type column beats two files.
2. **Each audit is a sweep with a scope**: a set of notes read against the tree as it is, plus
   against the roadmap as it stands, because "proposed state" rots too: a note describing planned
   work as built, or a plan a later decision superseded, is the same defect in the other
   direction. The sweep's output is per-claim: still true, corrected (loudly, per the house
   rule), or moved to the honest tense.
3. **Shrink the auditable surface over time**: each audit should convert some checkable claims
   into checked ones, the way the harness count moved from prose memory to a grep. Counts, file
   paths, statuses, and dates are mechanically re-derivable; a claim a gate re-derives can never
   rot again. This is the compounding half of the mechanism, and the reason audits should get
   cheaper each round rather than staying constant.
4. **Findings end in one of three states**, exactly 92's rule: fixed in the audit lane (most doc
   corrections are one lane's work), minted as a milestone (when a doc gap reveals a system gap,
   the 84-to-90 path), or recorded-accepted where a reader meets the claim. "Noted" is not a
   state.

## Scope note

This audits prose against reality; it does not write missing docs (milestone 68's remainder owns
doc examples and item docs) and does not restructure them (milestone 40 owns docs as a service,
milestone 91 owns the glossary; 91's every-use links add surface this mechanism then keeps true).
The staleness triggers worth building beyond cadence, recorded for the design rather than
promised: a note whose cited code has changed substantially since the note's last edit is the
highest-value candidate for the next sweep, and git can compute that; whether it becomes a signal
or stays a sweep heuristic is a decision for whoever builds this. The index and the reports share
92's home, `design/audit-reports/`, decided 2026-08-04.

## Follow-on

- **Recorded.** `notes/documentation-audit.md` answers the one question this block left open, which
  staleness triggers to build beyond the cadence. `script/audits --worklist` derives a note's
  candidacy from how much its cited code has moved since the note's last edit, and the reasoning
  there says why that stayed a sweep heuristic instead of becoming a signal that fires.
