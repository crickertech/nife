# 471. A `#[test_case]` that returns `Result<(), Skipped>`

Refused by milestone 214 (design/roadmap/214-print-and-return-skips.md), and
recorded there on 2026-09-03. Backfilled here on 2026-09-20 by
milestone 448 (design/roadmap/448-a-refusal-gets-a-number.md), which gave a refusal that names work a number, a
status and a condition that would change it. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**The date is when the refusal was written down, not necessarily when it was made.** Most of this
tree's `- **Refused.**` bullets were written in one sweep on 2026-09-03, so the decision is usually
older than the bullet and its reasoning sits in the block's own prose above it.

## The refusal, in its own words

From '214. A test that prints "skipping" and returns is counted as passed', under `## Follow-on`:

> Rung one, a `#[test_case]` returning `Result<(), Skipped>` so `?` carries an absent fixture out
> of a helper and into the runner. It is the better mechanism on paper and it would have caught
> the helper cases structurally, and it is a return-type change on every `#[test_case]` in the
> tree plus an `Ok(())` on the end of each, for a defect the console check catches at the moment
> it happens. If the helper shape recurs, that is the argument for paying for it.

## Why it is here rather than only there

This is rung one of AGENTS.md's ladder and the block says so: a return type that carries an absent
fixture out of a helper with `?` makes the print-and-pass defect structurally impossible, where the
console check that shipped instead catches it at the moment it happens. It costs a return type
change on every `#[test_case]` in the tree plus an `Ok(())` on the end of each.

## Revisit

- **Condition.** Stated in the refusal: "If the helper shape recurs, that is the argument for paying
  for it." The console check catches the direct case, so what would justify the higher rung is a
  second instance of the case it cannot catch structurally.

## Index row

A refusal of the stronger mechanism in favour of the cheaper one, made explicitly and with the trade
priced: rung one costs an edit to every test in the tree, rung two catches the same defect at the
moment it happens. The condition is a recurrence, which is the honest trigger for buying a mechanism
you declined once.
