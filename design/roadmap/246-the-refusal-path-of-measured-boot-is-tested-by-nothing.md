# 246. Measured boot's refusal path is tested by nothing, and one mutant turns it off

**Status: BUILT.** Minted 2026-09-03 by calef, from milestone 244's (the largest crate in the tree is
proved by nothing a mutation can reach) recorded limitation. Built 2026-09-03 by the lane on
`milestone/246-measured-refusal`.

## What was built, and the falsification

**The decision moved to `measured_boot::verdict`**, beside `verify_in_manifest`, whose rule it
applies. `system_initializer::measured` is now one line: an archive read and a call. Nothing about
the boot path changed, and `script/shell-check` still proves that the boot makes the call.

**`Lookup` did not have to move, which is the `BUGS` clause below not firing.** The signature takes
`Option<&[u8]>` rather than a `nifefs::Fs`, so the crate gained no archive dependency and the caller
passes `fs.read(name)` straight through; and it returns the parsed image rather than the bytes, so
the caller is left with no struct literal of its own to get wrong. The one dependency added is `elf`,
which has none of its own and is already in every build that links `measured_boot`. The public
surface gained one struct (`Verdict`, the old private `Lookup` with its two fields) and one function.

**The mutant, and it was run.** `unvouched: true` changed to `false` in `verdict`'s refusal arm, by
hand, before the test was committed: `substituted_bytes_are_refused_and_reported_as_unvouched` fails
with *"a substituted program must be reported unvouched"*, and nothing else in the tree goes red.
Reverted.

**Then the hand-run mutant was made a standing one**, which is the ladder's rung two rather than
rung four. `cargo mutants`' only operator on a function returning a struct is to replace the body
with `Default::default()`; without a `Default` impl that does not compile, so the tool scored the
mutant **unviable** and reported nothing at all about this function. `Verdict` now derives `Default`,
which is the fail-safe value (no image means nothing runs) and is exactly the dangerous wrong answer
here, an absence where there was a refusal. `cargo mutants -p measured_boot --in-diff` over this
lane's diff: **1 mutant, 1 caught.** Before the derive: 1 unviable, 0 tested.

**Three tests, one per answer**, because the three are not interchangeable and that distinction is
the interesting part of this function: substituted bytes (and a name the table never mentions, and
an empty table) are a refusal; an absent entry is not; and bytes the table vouches for that are not
an ELF report `unvouched: false`, because the measurement did its job and the packaging did not.
Putting a security word on a build defect would be the wrong answer there.

**In brief.** `system_initializer::measured` decides whether a component the system is about to start
was vouched for by the measured-boot manifest. It is the enforcement point of DECISIONS §104's
measurement, and **no test in this tree ever takes its refusing branch.**

```rust
if measured_boot::verify_in_manifest(table, name, bytes).is_err() {
    return Lookup { elf: None, unvouched: true };
}
```

**Change that `true` to `false` and an unvouched binary starts.** Nothing goes red. Milestone 244
measured that and recorded it beside the code: the function is *"proved only by `script/shell-check`
booting a system whose table happens to be right"*, which exercises the accept path and never the
refuse path.

## Why this is its own milestone rather than part of 244

**244 measured the whole crate and correctly declined to lift it**: 33 of 196 mutants are in pure
leaf functions, about sixty lines of 2,632, and moving them would put the boot path behind a feature
flag for a flattering score. That is the right answer for the aggregate.

**It is the wrong lens for this one function**, and separating them is the point of this block. The
other pure leaves are `hex_password`, `sentence`, `archive_name` and `opt_cap`: a mutant in any of
them produces a wrong string or a wrong option. A mutant here produces **a system that runs code
nobody vouched for**, which is the property `measured_boot` exists to provide. Counting those
mutants as interchangeable is what makes an aggregate fraction the wrong instrument.

## What makes it cheap, which is why it is worth doing now

`measured` takes a `nifefs::Fs`, a `&str` table and a `&str` name. **All three of its dependencies
already compile for the host** (`nifefs`, `measured_boot`, `elf`), and every one of them is already
mutated and covered. The function sits in an excluded crate because of its neighbours, not because of
anything it does.

## The proof that this milestone worked

**A host test that fails when the refusal is removed.** Concretely: a manifest and an archive that
disagree, asserting `unvouched` is set and no `Elf` is returned; and the mutant `unvouched: false`
turning it red. State the mutant that was run and that it was caught, the way milestone 193's block
states its falsification.

Not a test that only takes the accept path, which `script/shell-check` already does better.

## Follow-on

- **Proposed.** An unviable mutant is a hole in the measurement that reads as a pass. `cargo mutants`
  never mutated this milestone's own function: its only operator on a function returning a struct is
  `Default::default()`, `Verdict` had no `Default`, so the mutant did not compile and scored unviable
  rather than missed. `measured_boot` had nine such. See
  `design/roadmap/proposals/the-mutants-nobody-counts.md`.
- **Recorded.** `user/src/login.rs` spells the same load-or-refuse decision itself and folds all three
  outcomes into `None`, so it cannot distinguish an absent program from a refused one. `verdict`'s
  signature already fits it; it was not switched because that is a boot path this milestone did not
  gate. Beside the code, in `user/src/login.rs`.
- **Recorded.** `system_initializer::measured` still exists and is still host-unreachable, and
  `cargo mutants` generates nothing for it. "No mutants generated" is a property of the tool rather
  than a proof. Beside the code, in `crates/system_initializer/src/lib.rs`.

## BUGS

- **This does not make `system_initializer` measurable**, and should not be quoted as if it did. 163
  of its 196 mutants stay unreachable by construction; milestone 244's block carries the split.
- **A refusal proved on the host is not a refusal proved on the boot path.** The host test asserts
  the function's contract; that the boot *calls* it, on both ISAs, with the table the kernel measured,
  stays `script/shell-check`'s claim and nothing here strengthens it.
- **`Lookup` did not have to move as a `nifefs`-shaped thing, but a struct did become public.**
  `measured_boot::Verdict` is the old private `Lookup`, and `measured_boot` gained a dependency on
  `elf`. That is the smallest version of the cost this clause anticipated, not none of it.
- **`system_initializer::measured` still exists and is still unreachable by any host test.** It is a
  delegation with no branch and no literal, so `cargo mutants` generates nothing for it, but "no
  mutants generated" is a property of the tool rather than a proof. What is proved is the decision it
  delegates to.
- **The other refusal path in this tree was not touched.** `user/src/login.rs` runs the identical
  `verify_in_manifest` over the caretaker blob it was handed and folds all three outcomes into
  `None`; it takes bytes rather than an archive, so `verdict`'s signature already fits it, and
  nothing here changed it. See the handoff in this lane's report.
