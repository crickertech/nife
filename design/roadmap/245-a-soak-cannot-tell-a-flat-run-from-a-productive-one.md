# 245. A soak cannot tell a flat run from a productive one, so its duration is guesswork

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Minted 2026-09-03 by calef, from the duration question asked of the first
radon soaks and answered from the literature in notes/soak.md. *(Number provisional until the merge
queue lands it.)*

**Gate: NONE.** Milestone 240 (the soak reports what happened and not where, so an eightfold
difference cannot be explained) built the placement instrument this would histogram, and it is
merged.

**In brief.** `script/soak` prints eight counters every five seconds and **every one of them is a
volume.** `rounds`, `wakes`, `crossings`, `remote`, `steals` and `deferred` all count how much
happened. Nothing counts how many *different* things happened, so no beat can be compared with the
beat before it and **a run that stopped learning anything an hour ago looks exactly like one that is
still finding new interleavings.**

That is why the duration question has no answer today. notes/soak.md's own research section reached
this and named the gap rather than papering over it:

> This is the gap worth closing before the duration argument is worth having

## Why this is the milestone and not more hours

**The saturation is measured, by somebody else, on this exact question.** Burckhardt, Kothari, Musuvathi
and Nagarakatte, *A Randomized Scheduler with Probabilistic Guarantees of Finding Bugs*, ASPLOS 2010,
instrumented a work stealing queue with twenty events and 168 possible event pairs and compared
coverage against run count:

> We restrict the horizontal axis to the 8192 runs as stress did not explore any new event pair beyond
> those already explored in the new runs after that and PCT eventually explored all the event pairs.
> [...] Fig. 11 shows that stress does not cover more than 20% of the event pairs, few of which result
> in a bug.

Their stress harness inserted random sleeps, thread suspensions and priority changes, which is a
superset of this soak's jitter. **Coverage climbed, flattened, and the flat part was free.** This
project has no way to see which part it is in.

**And the cost of not knowing is now measured here rather than assumed.** Two radon runs on
2026-09-03, the same card:

| | crossings total | crossings/s |
|---|---|---|
| the 2 h 59 m run | 5,509 | 0.51 |
| the run that followed it | 197,952 in 17 min | 186 |

The second boot passed the first's entire three-hour crossing count in about **thirty seconds**. A
duration chosen in hours is therefore choosing an unknown multiple of the thing that matters, and the
multiple is set by a boot-time lottery nobody controls.

## What would close it

**A coarse histogram over the placement and scheduling decisions the soak makes, reported per beat,
so a beat can be compared with the one before it.** Milestone 240 already computes the raw material:
`sched::last_cpus` knows where every worker is, and the census prints it whenever it changes. What is
missing is the summary that turns a sequence of arrangements into *"this beat saw an arrangement no
earlier beat saw"* or *"this beat saw nothing new."*

The shape is deliberately not specified here, because the interesting design question is what counts
as a distinct behaviour, and that is the milestone rather than a detail of it. Some candidates, none
endorsed:

- **Distinct settled arrangements**, which is the coarsest and probably the most honest, given that
  240 found the arrangement is stable on silicon (`drifted=0` held for a whole run) where it churns
  under QEMU.
- **Distinct (waker core, woken core) pairs**, which is closest to PCT's event pairs and closest to
  the path the recorded defect lived on.
- **Distinct orderings within a group's exchange**, which is the most sensitive and the most
  expensive.

**Whatever it is, it must be cheap enough to run for hours** and must not itself perturb what it
measures. notes/soak.md already records a 6% throughput effect from merely draining the serial port,
seen once, which is the standing warning about instruments on this workload.

## The proof that this milestone worked

**A run says, from its own output, whether it is still finding new behaviour**, and two runs of
different lengths can be compared on that basis rather than on hours. Concretely: a beat line, or a
line beside it, from which a reader can see the curve flatten.

Not a new counter that rises monotonically, which is what the existing eight already do.

## BUGS

- **This does not decide a duration**, and should not be read as promising one. It makes the duration
  decidable from evidence; the number stays calef's, on the axis notes/soak.md gives him.
- **A flat histogram is not proof a run is worthless.** PCT's own finding is that stress covers a
  fraction of the space and stays there; a soak that has gone flat on placement may still be
  accumulating hours of the *same* interleaving, which is exactly what a wearout or leak question
  would want and a concurrency question would not.
- **It measures this soak's behaviour, not the kernel's.** A histogram over the workload's placements
  says nothing about paths no worker takes, and reading it as a coverage number for the scheduler
  would be the same overclaim `notes/mutation-testing.md` warns about for its own score.
- **Nothing here helps the slow draw.** A run at 0.51 crossings per second will look flat because it
  is barely doing anything, and distinguishing "flat because saturated" from "flat because starved"
  is a real hazard this block does not solve.
