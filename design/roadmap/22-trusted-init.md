# 22. Trusted init: verify it, and shrink what a broken one can do

**Status: BUILT.**

**In brief.** Measured/secure boot that checks init before running it; reduce init's authority so a compromise is bounded

**Why it matters.** **closes the thesis's own soft spot:** init is the privileged *unverified* component the whole system is built by

**The soft spot this closes.** §14 promises "a verified core that confines unverified workloads."
init is unverified, but it is not a *typical* workload: it holds the process-construction authority
and builds every other process. At runtime the kernel confines it as well as anything (MMU
isolation is proved, its code is W^X, capabilities are unforgeable), and a compromised init
**cannot break the kernel or escape confinement**. But its *bytes* are currently loaded unsigned and
unchecked, and its *authority* is broad, so within that authority a corrupted init can do real harm
(endow malicious children, deny the system it was meant to start).

**Deliverable, three halves.**

1. **Verify init before it runs. (Phase B.1, BUILT 2026-07-29.)** A measured boot step: the kernel
   checks init's hash before dropping to EL0/U-mode at its entry. seL4's high-assurance deployments do
   exactly this for the root task; it was the single biggest gap between "verified kernel" and
   "trustworthy system." Built as the **measured** variant: the build hashes the archive entry it
   packed and `kernel/build.rs` compiles the digest into the kernel image, so the check means "this
   kernel image runs exactly this init" with no keys and no signature code in the TCB. SHA-256,
   hand-written in `crates/measured_boot`, one implementation shared by the build and the kernel. Fails
   closed both ways: wrong bytes halt, and an *unmeasured* program halts too (an empty trust root
   vouches for nothing). Both ISAs. The **signature** variant (update init without rebuilding the
   kernel, at the cost of Ed25519 in the TCB and a key-custody question) is recorded in DECISIONS §26's
   phase B block as a follow-up, not built. See notes/trusted-init.md.
2. **Shrink the blast radius. (Phase B.2, BUILT 2026-07-29; the interactive boot's migration is the
   remaining increment.)** Reduce what a compromised init can do: hand most process-construction to
   smaller, less-privileged sub-servers, so init's own authority is minimal and short-lived (build the
   first servers, then drop the untyped). The less init holds, the less a broken init costs. Built as a
   four-program tree (`root_supervisor`, `spawner`, `sub_server_supervisor`, `flaky`): the spawner holds one program image and
   a `WRITE`-only budget (not the archive, so it can build exactly one program), the supervisor holds
   no memory at all and can only *ask*, and the root deletes its untyped once both are running. Proven
   on both ISAs by authority rather than timing: after the handoff, retyping a page or a kernel object
   from init fails with `NoSuchSlot`, and a faulting sub-server is reaped and restarted by its own
   supervisor. **That migration then reached the interactive boot itself (BUILT 2026-08-04, both ISAs).**
   `system_initializer` and `hello`'s init role remain the shell's spawn service, but they no longer
   hold the construction budget for life: after the boot servers are up, each carves a bounded
   scratch budget and a bounded job pool, deletes the root, and gives away the UART device
   capability, its interrupt, and every capability reaching a live job's memory. A new `job_undertaker`
   (one endpoint, `READ`, no untyped, no restart policy) collects finished jobs and returns their
   regions to the pool. Proven the same way the rest of this milestone is: init prints, from inside
   itself, that `RETYPE` now answers `NoSuchSlot` rather than `NotPermitted`, and `script/shell-check`
   runs eleven jobs through a six-job pool, so a boot that collected nothing fails partway down.
   The predicted sub-server for the spawn service was **refused with a reason** (the spawn service is
   the ELF loader and the loader is the archive, so a sub-server would hold every program in the
   system while init held a pipe); see notes/trusted-init.md. Two design
   forks found and reported rather than built through (a reap-only right, and turning a tid into a
   handle). See DECISIONS §26's phase B.2 block and notes/trusted-init.md.

   **Both of those forks are now closed (DECISIONS §32, BUILT 2026-07-29, both ISAs).** Reaping
   moved off `Untyped::DESTROY`, which needs `WRITE` on the region and therefore the same right that
   *builds* a process from it, onto `Endpoint::REAP` on the supervision endpoint. Authorization
   needed no new bookkeeping: §26 already records `Thread::fault_ep` and the kernel already stamps
   the tid, so the check is that the named thread's recorded endpoint *is* the one being invoked.
   The tid-to-handle fork is closed for this case by the same move, because the tid is authorized
   relative to the endpoint it arrived on rather than being a global handle. The measured payoff:
   **`sub_server_supervisor` now holds nothing but endpoints**, since the phase B.2 proxy that had to ask `spawner`
   to reap is no longer needed. The measured limit: milestone 36's `c_confiner` still holds a
   construction budget because it is *also* the builder, which shows the bundling was two things and
   only one of them was the reap. `REAP` refuses a live thread on purpose, so a **hung** child still
   cannot be restarted; that is the watchdog case and it belongs to 23. Two Kani harnesses in
   `crates/capability` cover the authorization invariant. See notes/supervision.md.
3. **Supervise, don't relaunch-in-kernel.** What happens when init (or any server) *fails*, as
   distinct from being corrupted. The failure of init degrades to a **halt, never a breach**
   (the kernel's guarantees hold regardless), so the only open question is availability: halt, or
   recover? The answer is neither a bare halt nor a kernel that relaunches init.

   - **Not kernel-relaunch.** Relaunching init from the kernel re-imports the loader we just
     evicted (milestone 19) plus *restart policy* (retries, backoff, escalation) into the trusted
     core, and it crash-loops on a deterministic fault (init panics on a bad ELF; relaunch hits
     the same bug). Restart is policy, and policy does not belong in the kernel.
   - **The mechanism/policy split, as everywhere else.** Add one small *mechanism* to the kernel:
     a **fault/death notification**, when a thread faults or exits, the kernel delivers a message
     to an endpoint held by whoever holds the capability to supervise it. Capability-gated (you
     can supervise a thread only if you were granted its fault endpoint), mechanism-only. This is
     seL4's fault endpoint.
   - **Policy lives in a userspace supervision tree.** init builds the system, wires supervisors,
     and either becomes a *minimal* root supervisor (so small it essentially cannot fail) or steps
     back. A sub-server that dies is restarted by *its* supervisor with whatever policy it wants
     (bounded retries, fall-back, give-up), in userspace. Failures below the root are contained
     and restartable; only the death of the irreducible root supervisor halts, which is the
     fail-closed floor, pushed as high and as small as possible.
   - **This also dissolves the SPOF.** init-during-boot stays a single point of failure (if it
     cannot build the system, halt is correct: nothing to recover to). init-*after*-boot stops
     being one: it is either a trivial root or gone, and failures below it are supervised.

   The one kernel primitive this adds (the fault endpoint) is worth its own numbered decision when
   19d.2/22 make it concrete; recorded here so the design (halt is the floor, supervision is the
   answer, the kernel never runs restart policy) is on the record rather than in a conversation.

**The reach tail.** Beyond verifying init's *bytes*, verifying init's *behaviour* is the natural
next layer inward for the §14 thesis: init is small and privileged enough to be worth proving, once
the kernel's proofs are done. Recorded as the direction, not committed. (Distinct from supervision
above: proof buys *safety*, supervision buys *availability*; init's failure mode is availability, so
supervision is the load-bearing answer and proof is the optional reach.)

**Prior art.** seL4 + a verified boot chain (measured boot, or CapDL-driven system initialisers
whose output is checkable); the general secure/measured-boot literature (TPM/PCR measurement,
signed boot images). For the supervision half: seL4 fault endpoints (the kernel turns a fault into
a message a supervisor holds); MINIX 3's reincarnation server (a userspace process that restarts
dead drivers, not the kernel); Erlang/OTP supervision trees and "let it crash" (decades of evidence
that restart policy wants to be a rich userspace thing, not a kernel reflex).

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 23.** Restarting a **hung** child. `Endpoint::REAP` refuses a live thread on purpose,
  so a child that is stuck rather than dead cannot be collected or restarted through this
  milestone's mechanism. That is the watchdog case, and this block hands it to 23, which
  demonstrated it on 2026-08-17.
- **Recorded.** `notes/trusted-init.md`, under "The signature variant, recorded and not built": the
  variant that would let init be updated without rebuilding the kernel, at the cost of Ed25519 in
  the TCB and a key-custody question nobody has answered. DECISIONS §26's phase B block defers it
  deliberately.
- **Recorded.** `notes/supervision.md`: milestone 36's `c_confiner` still holds a full construction
  budget after the reap moved to `Endpoint::REAP`, because it is also the builder. The bundling was
  two things and only one of them was the reap.
- **Decision.** `design/decisions/26-fault-endpoint.md`. The fault endpoint, the one kernel
  primitive phase 3 adds, got the numbered decision this block asked for when 19d.2 and 22 made it
  concrete: the kernel delivers a message and never runs restart policy, and policy lives in the
  userspace supervision tree.
- **Recorded.** `design/roadmap/22-trusted-init.md`, under "The reach tail": proving init's
  *behaviour* as distinct from verifying its bytes is the direction and is explicitly not committed.
  Proof buys safety, supervision buys availability, and init's failure mode is availability.
