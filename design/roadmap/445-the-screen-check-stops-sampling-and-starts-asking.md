# 445. The screen check stops sampling and starts asking

**Status: BUILT** 2026-09-20. Minted 2026-09-20 by the maintainer, after calef chose option A among
three put to him the same day. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

## The defect, measured

`cargo xtask uefi-boot` asserts milestone 243's claim, that a machine with no serial port shows its
boot on its screen, by photographing the guest's framebuffer through QEMU's monitor. It used to do
that by **sampling**: `screen_watch` polled `screendump` every 50 ms and had to catch the kernel's
marker on a screen that does not stay that way.

On **2026-09-20** a full `script/test` run caught **zero** rows and reported *"the tour was never
readable on the screen"*. The same leg, run alone a minute later, read 56. Under load the
dump-write-read-decode round trip stretches; the guest's window does not stretch with it, because it
closes in **guest** time. No host-side deadline widens it.

And the verdict was worse than the flake. `tour: None` is the same value a genuinely broken
framebuffer produces, so the message sent the reader after the loader's `LocateProtocol`, the pixel
order, the stride and the mapping surviving `mmu::init`, none of which was wrong.

## What calef chose, and what he refused

Three options were put to him on 2026-09-20:

- **A, a handshake**, so the window closes when the host says it has seen the screen. **Chosen.**
- **B, an xtask-only mode where the handover simply does not clear.** Refused: it makes the
  screen-check boot differ from a real boot at exactly the moment under test.
- **C, keep sampling and only fix the verdict's honesty.** Not taken: sampling a transient state and
  hoping is rung four of `AGENTS.md`'s ladder, and a longer deadline does not help for the reason
  above.

## What was built

### The kernel holds the screen, when it is asked to

A boot-time knob, **off by default**, on the same command line the framebuffer description already
travels on (`machine_discovery::framebuffer::Framebuffer::KEY`, `screen=`). The new token is
`SCREEN_HOLD`, the bare word `screen-hold`. With it present:

1. `kernel::console::yield_screen` calls `hold_screen_for_host` before it takes the console lock.
2. That prints `boot_ladder::SCREEN_HELD` on the serial line and waits for one byte back.
3. `cargo xtask uefi-boot` sees the line in the transcript it is now streaming, takes its dump with
   the tour guaranteed to be on the framebuffer, decodes it, and writes a byte.
4. The kernel drains that byte and clears and hands over exactly as it does today.

**A boot without the token is untouched**: one relaxed load of an `AtomicBool` on a path taken once
per boot, no serial read, no added latency. The doc comment on `hold_screen_at_handover` says in as
many words that it is a debugging affordance.

**The token rather than a build of the kernel, deliberately.** The kernel `uefi-boot` boots is
byte-identical to the one on a stick; only the loader differs, by one word it writes. That is the
narrowest form of calef's refusal of option B that still lets a gate ask a question.

### The wait is bounded twice, and both bounds have a reason

A knob that can wedge a machine forever is a worse defect than the one it fixes.

- **Ten seconds of scheduler ticks** (`TICK_HZ` is 100 on all three architectures). The host's round
  trip is a monitor command, an asynchronous PPM write, a read and a glyph decode, about 50 ms idle.
  Ten seconds is two orders of magnitude of headroom for the loaded machine that broke the old gate,
  and short enough that a knob set by mistake on a bench is a pause somebody waits out.
- **A flat poll count**, paid down only while the tick counter has not yet moved. Ticks come from
  the timer interrupt, so a clock that has stopped would otherwise turn the first bound into no
  bound at all.

### Two things had to be found by building it, and both are corrections

**A spinning guest starves the emulator's own monitor.** The first working version polled the UART
with `core::hint::spin_loop`. Every `screendump` taken during the ten-second hold came back a file
that would not decode, and the gate failed for a reason with nothing to do with the kernel. Parking
the core with `arch::wait_for_interrupt` between polls fixed it outright, and the `clock_alive`
guard above is what makes parking safe. Worth carrying: anything in this tree that busy-waits inside
a guest while a host is trying to talk to QEMU has this failure available to it.

**The tour is taller than the screen, so it scrolls.** `UEFI_SCREEN_MARKER` was
`boot_ladder::BANNER`, the tour's *first* line, moved there hours earlier by milestone 243's second
lane on a measurement saying the tour "tops out at 98 non-blank rows" against a screen of 100, so
nothing scrolls. **Held still and photographed, the OVMF console's first row is**

```text
                0x00007ea8a000..0x00007eab4000  ram
```

the middle of the firmware memory map, with 95 rows below it and no banner anywhere. So what the old
sampler was catching was the banner **early in the boot**, before the scroll, which is a window at
the other end of the tour from the one its own comment described, and which is why a loaded machine
read zero: the first dump landed after the scroll rather than after the clear. The marker is the
self-test verdict again, the tour's tail, which the handshake makes deterministic.
`boot_ladder::BANNER` is now the *deep* marker, reported when a screen is tall enough to still hold
it and never on this one.

### The verdict distinguishes three outcomes

| what happened | what it says |
|---|---|
| held, tour on the screen | how many rows, and whether the tour scrolled |
| **held, tour not on the screen** | the framebuffer path broke, and it says the boot was stopped while the dump was taken, so timing is not available to blame |
| **never held** | the handshake did not reach the kernel: the `screen_hold` feature, the token, or a boot that never got that far. Not the framebuffer |

The middle row is what the milestone bought. The bottom row is what cost a reader an afternoon.

## Evidence, under the condition that broke it

Three consecutive `cargo xtask uefi-boot` runs on patagonia (8 cores) against fourteen detached
spinners, at one-minute load averages of **17, 32 and 38**:

```text
uefi-boot: read 95 non-blank row(s) of the tour back off the framebuffer (its last page; ...), ending
uefi-boot: booted under OVMF from \EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI
```

Exactly 95 rows every time, which is the point: the reading is now a property of the framebuffer
rather than of the host's spare capacity.

## Architectural parity

DECISIONS §19 makes parity a gate, so the answer is stated rather than implied.

**The mechanism is arch-neutral.** `yield_screen` consults the flag on all three architectures, the
wait is one piece of code, and both console UART drivers grew the receive half it needs: the NS16550
pair came out from behind `reboot_soak_test`, and the PL011 gained `rx_waiting` and `discard_rx` of
its own.

**Only `x86_64` arms it, and the other two have nothing to arm it for.** The race is the window
between the tour being painted and `yield_screen` clearing it. On aarch64 and riscv64 the only
screen is `kernel::screen`'s `ramfb`, whose pixels are the kernel's own `.bss`, and
`user::boot_screen_terminal` refuses to hand that to a userspace driver rather than grant a process
a window onto kernel statics. So `yield_screen` is never reached there, nothing clears the tour, and
`cargo xtask screen-boot` photographs a screen that will show the same thing an hour later.

**`script/boot-check` does not have this race either**, which was worth checking rather than
assuming: it asserts its rungs on the serial transcript, which is a stream and not a state, and it
takes no screendump at all.

That changes when milestone 157 (real display output on the board) gives those two a firmware
aperture outside the kernel image. The refusal stops firing, the handover starts happening, and the
window appears. What is needed then is a reader for `/chosen/bootargs`, which this kernel does not
parse today, and one call beside it. The scope note lives on `hold_screen_at_handover`, where the
next person meets it.

## BUGS

- **The gate's loader is not the stick's loader.** `cargo xtask uefi-boot` stages
  `target/esp-screen` with `screen_hold` on; `cargo xtask uefi-image` stages `target/esp` without
  it, and that is the one the bench procedure copies from. A stick made from the wrong directory
  waits ten seconds at the screen handover for a host that is not there. Three ESP directories now,
  for the reason `uefi_test_esp_dir` gave for the second: the alternative is a build that can reach
  a bench by accident.
- **Nothing gates the two directories apart.** The separation is a function name and two comments,
  which is rung three. A lint that knew which directory a `cp` came from would be guessing.
- **The release byte is any byte**, so a person typing at a held boot releases it. That is the
  intended behaviour for somebody at a bench and is worth knowing before it surprises anyone.
- **`hold_screen_for_host` takes the console lock once per poll**, at 100 Hz while parked. It is a
  boot-time path taken once and never on a machine anybody runs, so the cost is a fact rather than a
  concern; it is recorded because the lock is an `IrqSafeMutex` and somebody will want to know.
- **The deep marker is dead on QEMU's OVMF console.** `boot_ladder::BANNER` cannot be on a 1280x800
  screen at the handover, so that branch of the report has never been exercised here. It fires on a
  taller screen or a shorter tour and is kept because a tour that stops scrolling should say so.

## Follow-on

- **Recorded.** The parity scope note is on `kernel::console::hold_screen_at_handover`, and names
  milestone 157 as what makes the other two architectures need the knob.
- **Recorded.** `notes/qemu.md`'s BUGS entry is rewritten: this milestone supersedes it, and it now
  carries the starved-monitor finding, which is general.
- **Recorded.** The three-ESP-directory hazard, in `notes/x86-uefi-boot.md` beside the commands and
  in `uefi_loader/Cargo.toml` beside the feature.
- **Names, provisional** (`AGENTS.md`: calef names these). `screen-hold` the token and `SCREEN_HOLD`
  the constant; `SCREEN_HELD` the announcement in `boot_ladder`; `hold_screen_at_handover` and
  `hold_screen_for_host` in `kernel::console`; `screen_hold` the `uefi_loader` feature;
  `uefi_screen_esp_dir` and `uefi_kernel` in `xtask`; `Pl011::rx_waiting` and `Pl011::discard_rx`.

## Index row

**Built:** 2026-09-20

`cargo xtask uefi-boot` asserted milestone 243's claim by sampling a window that closes in guest
time, so a loaded machine read zero rows and blamed the framebuffer. The kernel is asked to hold the
screen instead: `screen-hold` on the boot command line makes `yield_screen` announce itself on the
serial line and wait up to ten seconds for a byte before it clears, bounded twice so no knob can
wedge a machine. Three runs at load 17, 32 and 38 each read exactly 95 rows. Two corrections fell
out of building it: a spinning guest starves QEMU's own monitor so the wait parks the core, and the
tour is taller than the screen and scrolls, so the marker goes back to its tail.
