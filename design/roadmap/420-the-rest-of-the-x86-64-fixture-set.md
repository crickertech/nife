# 420. x86_64 has one fixture of five and no NIC, GPU, keyboard or RNG, so its skip count is a device list

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Promoted from the proposal `the-rest-of-the-x86-64-fixture-set`, filed
2026-09-16 by the milestone 303 lane (x86_64's FS disk), which attached the RedoxFS image and
deliberately stopped there so that one milestone proved one thing. Milestone 215's block listed the
same set without numbering it. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**Gate: NONE.** Every device named here is one QEMU emulates on `q35`, and milestone 303 removed the
structural obstacle: `virtio::find_block_device_n` spans virtio-mmio and virtio-pci, so a wiring on
a machine with no mmio bus can find its disk.

**Premise re-checked 2026-09-19 and still true, device by device.**
`scripts/qemu-runner-x86_64.sh` attaches two `virtio-blk-pci` functions and one `nvme` controller
and nothing else: no `virtio-net-pci`, no `virtio-gpu-pci`, no `virtio-keyboard-pci`, no
`virtio-rng-pci`, and no crash, GPT or blank disk.

**What the work is.** `scripts/qemu-runner-x86_64.sh` attaches two `virtio-blk-pci` functions (the
nifefs image and the RedoxFS image) and an NVMe controller, and nothing else. Missing, each with a
test in the tree that skips for want of it: milestone 37's crash disk, milestone 57's GPT and blank
disks, a `virtio-net-pci` NIC, a `virtio-gpu-pci`, a `virtio-keyboard-pci` and a `virtio-rng-pci`.
Each is one `-device` line, the matching `mk*disk` call in `cargo xtask test`'s x86_64 leg, and, for
the three disks, nothing else at all, because the lookup already counts across both buses.

**What it would settle.** How much of this port's skip count is a machine fact and how much is a
runner that was never asked. It is also the honest answer to DECISIONS §19 for a family of
capabilities currently green on two architectures because the third has no device, not because the
third cannot drive one.

**Why it was not done in 303.** Scope: that milestone's subject was one disk and one transcript, and
bundling six more devices into it would have made a green suite ambiguous about which change bought
which test. The display half in particular is not merely a `-device` line: milestone 161's own note
records that `console`, `input` and `keyboard_driver` want work beyond attaching hardware.

**Recorded in the meantime** where a reader meets the gap:
`design/roadmap/303-x86-64-fs-disk.md`'s `BUGS`, and
`design/roadmap/215-x86-64-pci-interrupt-routing.md`, which listed the set first.

## Index row

`scripts/qemu-runner-x86_64.sh` attaches the nifefs image, the RedoxFS image and an NVMe controller,
and nothing else, so milestone 37's crash disk, milestone 57's GPT and blank disks, a NIC, a GPU, a
keyboard and an RNG are each a test in the tree that skips for want of a device QEMU emulates on
`q35`. Each is one `-device` line plus the matching `mk*disk` call in the x86_64 leg and, for the
three disks, nothing else, because milestone 303 removed the structural obstacle:
`virtio::find_block_device_n` spans virtio-mmio and virtio-pci, so a wiring on a machine with no
mmio bus finds its disk. What it settles is how much of this port's skip count is a machine fact and
how much is a runner nobody asked, which is the honest answer to §19 for a family of capabilities
green on two architectures because the third has no device. The display half is not merely a
`-device` line, and milestone 161's note says what else it wants.
