# 499. A renumber that cannot cite the wrong section

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)* Promoted from the
proposal `a-renumber-that-cannot-cite-the-wrong-section`, filed 2026-09-19, on calef's instruction
of 2026-09-20 to give every proposal on `main` a number. The text below is the proposal's own,
unedited except for this paragraph: the argument is its author's and promotion is not the moment to
improve it. Filed by the integrator after the third `design/decisions/` number collision between two
sessions in ninety minutes, on the evening calef ruled that the interleaving stays
([§194 (sessions interleave rather than serialize, and a)](../../decisions/194-sessions-interleave-rather-than-serialize.md)).

**Gate: NONE.** It is a mode on a script that already exists, over files already in the tree.

**In brief.** When two sessions mint from the same range and one lands first, the other's whole run
shifts. That happened four times on 2026-09-19 in two and a half hours: §156, then §157, then §158,
then §159, each landing moving one branch's run up by one, from §156-§189 to §160-§194. The shift itself is mechanical. **The hazard is the
citations**, and it is specific: a `§` rewritten by number can be silently wrong and still pass
every gate in the tree, because the section it now names exists. `script/decisions --check` verifies
that §174 resolves. Nothing can tell it the sentence meant the section that used to be §173.

## What the tool does, because it was written before it was proposed

The third renumber was done by a script rather than by hand, and it is the shape to land:

1. **Rename descending**, so no rename clobbers the next one.
2. **Bump each file's own `# N.` heading with its file**, in the same pass, so a heading can never
   disagree with its name.
3. **Rewrite citations keyed on the filename**, never on the number. `157-what-a-subshell-copies.md`
   is unique across a collision; `§157` is not.
4. **Move a `§N` sigil only on a line that already names the file it belongs to.**
5. **Print every remaining bare sigil in the affected range for a person to read.** This is the step
   that earns the tool. It is an admission that the last few cannot be decided mechanically, and it
   turns them from a silent rewrite into a short list.

Steps 1 to 4 are the mechanism; step 5 is the honest floor under it.

## Where it should live

`script/decisions`, as a `--renumber-from <n>` mode, because that script already owns the index, the
numbering check and the gap check, and whoever is renumbering is already running it. The version
used on 2026-09-19, for the third shift and the fourth, lives in a session scratchpad, which is rung four and is why this exists.

## BUGS

- **Step 5 cannot be gated.** Telling an intended citation from an unintended one is reading prose
  for intent, which this tree already priced at `git grep -w TODO`'s 82% false-positive rate. The
  tool lists; a person decides.
- **It does not prevent the collision**, and is not meant to. §194 rules that the interleaving is
  the condition being modeled rather than a fault to design out.
