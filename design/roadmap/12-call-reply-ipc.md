# 12. Call/Reply IPC: a one-shot reply capability

**Status: BUILT.**

**In brief.** Reply-to-caller as a kernel guarantee. **Built, §12.**

**Why it matters.** the IPC the TCB must get right

**Built (milestone 12); see DECISIONS §12 and notes/ipc-naming.md.** The rest of this block is the
proposal it was built from.

**Deliverable.** A kernel-minted, single-use reply capability handed to a server on a `Call`, so it
can answer *whoever* called without being individually wired to them, and can answer exactly once.

**Why first.** Small, self-contained, and it retires a real wart: request/reply currently burns two
endpoints, and the console server is correct only *by convention* (it is single-threaded and IPC is
synchronous rendezvous), not by construction. The moment a server serves clients it was not wired
to, or a thread pool shares a reply path, the convention breaks.

**Prior art.** Mach's `send-once` right (it had this in the 1980s); seL4's `Reply` cap minted on
`Call`, with a call chain that also enables priority donation.

**Detail.** design/open-design-ideas.md (Call/Reply) and notes/ipc-naming.md already work the
functional and safety triggers. It widens the §4 syscall surface (a `Call` method, a `Reply`
object), so it is a real decision, not a speculative add. This milestone turns that entry into code
and gives it its own numbered §.

## Follow-on

- **None.** The block is a proposal and its own build; the reply capability, the `Call` method and
  the syscall-surface widening it named all landed, and it names nothing left over.
