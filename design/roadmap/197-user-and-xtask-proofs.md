# 197. `user/` and `xtask` are out of reach of the prover, for exactly the reason the kernel was

**Status: BUILT 2026-08-31**, the `user/` half; `xtask` is refused with an argument, and the timer
seam below is untouched and still a fork. Minted 2026-08-30 from milestone 193's (put `kernel/src`
within reach of the prover) lane. notes/user-proofs.md is the record. *(Number provisional until the
merge queue lands it.)*

## What was built, and where the block was wrong

**One property, over code that lives in `user/src/printenv.rs` today, proved by two harnesses
`script/verify` runs, and falsified before it was believed.** `push_never_writes_past_the_buffer_it_was_given`
says that for every starting offset in the whole of `usize` and every content, the bounded append
that renders a configuration page this program did not write stays inside its 96-byte line buffer,
appends only at the offset it was given, and reports exactly what it wrote;
`the_buffer_can_be_filled_exactly` is the `kani::cover!` that the boundary is reached, so the
assertion is not proved by an assumption set that never gets near it. Relaxing one `<` to `<=` turns
both red, and the patch is recorded (`user/falsifications/`). **Cost: 2.4 seconds** on
`script/verify`'s ~650.

**The premise above is half false, and that is the finding.** This block argued `user/` had a better
claim on the prover than the kernel because it holds real parsers over untrusted bytes. It mostly
does not, any more: rule 7 and the host-testability discipline have already lifted the initrd, ELF,
GPT, mDNS, directory-entry, terminal-escape, shell and glob parsers into crates, **every one of
which is in `script/verify`'s table today**. What is left in `user/src` is overwhelmingly IO glue.
The prize this block was reaching for had largely been collected under other numbers.

**A live defect fell out anyway, and it fell out before any harness ran.** `rmle`'s save buffer was
`MAX_ROWS * MAX_COLS`, the size of the document's *text*, while `save` joins the rows with `\n` and
so writes up to `MAX_ROWS - 1` bytes more. A document at both bounds staged 3231 bytes into a
3200-byte buffer and panicked the editor on `^S`, and nothing had found it. It was found by writing
the property down, which is the first time the two constants were compared. The fix is the buffer
sized `MAX_ROWS * (MAX_COLS + 1)` **plus a `const` assertion**, not a harness: the claim is a
relationship between compile-time constants, so rung one of the ladder holds it for nothing.

**Three property shapes did not work, and the numbers are the deliverable.** A bound on a sum of 32
symbolic values did not finish in twenty minutes on CaDiCaL or Z3, because it is a cardinality
argument and that is what resolution-based SAT is worst at. A symbolic index into the editor's
3.5 KB document struct exhausted CBMC's memory in 3m23s. Any assertion about a value downstream of
`render`'s twenty chained divisions stopped finishing, while the same harness asserting only a
length bound returns in 0.3 seconds because `--slice-formula` throws the divisions away: **a fast
harness can be evidence that the assertion asked nothing.**

**Mechanically it was cheaper than the kernel.** No `--ignore-global-asm`, because there is no
`global_asm!` under `user/` at all (rule 1 again). Two changes: `#[cfg(not(kani))]` on the one
binary's `user_rt::panic_handler!()`, and `--bin` selection, because `cargo kani -p user` compiles
all 68 programs and Kani refuses any `#![no_std]` root that never mentions it. The `--bin` list is
**derived from a grep of the tree** in `script/verify` rather than written there, for the reason that
file has already recorded twice: a list one name short fails invisibly and the suite just goes green
faster.

**`xtask` is refused**, and the argument is in notes/user-proofs.md rather than left as a shrug. Its
front door is already open (`cargo kani -p xtask` compiles with no changes at all, measured), so the
refusal is on value: a defect there cannot reach anything that runs, it is host `std` code with
tests and a debugger where Kani is least differentiated, its pure logic already lives in crates the
suite proves, and its hand-written decoders **exist to be a second opinion** on the crates they
check, so aiming one prover at both halves narrows the independence that justifies them.

*This block carried `Gate: NONE` while it was open, and correctly: the `user/` half needed nothing
that did not exist, milestone 193 having established the mechanics. The line is gone because a BUILT
milestone cannot have one. The timer seam further down was and is a genuine fork, marked as one
there rather than gating this block.*

**In brief.** `script/verify`'s header names three things `cargo kani` never compiles: the kernel, the
user programs, and xtask. Milestone 193 removed the first for about ten seconds of run time. The
other two are unchanged, and **`user/` has at least as good a claim on the prover as the kernel did**,
because it holds real parsers over bytes this system did not produce.

## Why `user/` first

`notes/untrusted-input-audit.md` already surveys that surface. A parser over attacker-supplied input
is the case bounded model checking is best at and the case where a defect is worst, which is the
combination that made `dtb::be32`'s unchecked `at + 4` worth catching.

The mechanics should be milestone 193's, and cheaply: `#[cfg(not(kani))]` on what Kani duplicates,
`--ignore-global-asm` where needed, and the stub boundary enumerated where the next author meets it.

## Two smaller things the same lane found

**The timer re-arm seam, and it is a fork rather than work.** Milestone 191 (did the proofs catch the
bugs?) named the milestone 6 timer drift as the sharpest counterfactual in the tree: its property is
already proved in `crates/timetable`'s `next_after`, over already-written code, and the timer does
not call it. Milestone 193's lane could not use it, because `rearm` lives in
`kernel/src/arch/{aarch64,riscv64}/timer.rs` and reads the counter through `asm!`. Lifting the
arithmetic out of the register access would fix that, and **where the seam goes is a design question**:
too high and the arch layer keeps the bug, too low and every ISA restates it.

**`crates/timetable` is in the verify table and the kernel does not depend on it**, which is the other
half of the same observation and is untouched.

## BUGS

- **`xtask` was named here and not argued for**, and it is now argued and refused; see above and
  notes/user-proofs.md. What would reverse the refusal is `xtask` growing logic the target then
  trusts, and the shape to watch is the measured-boot digest, which already lives in
  `crates/measured_boot` for exactly this reason.
- **The run-time cost was not estimated here** and is now measured: 2.4 seconds for the two
  harnesses that shipped, against `script/verify`'s ~650. The worry that "a parser over symbolic
  input can cost far more" was right in a way this block did not predict: the expensive shapes are
  not parsers but sums, symbolic indices into large structs, and values downstream of division, and
  three such properties were abandoned with the measurements recorded.
- **`script/falsifications` walks `crates/` only.** This milestone's falsification record and patch
  live under `user/`, and `kernel`'s two harnesses from milestone 193 carry no record at all, so the
  ratio that script prints is over `crates/` rather than over the tree and it does not know it.
  Closing it needs the walk derived from `cargo metadata` and `--sweep` taught that a package can
  have binaries; proposed as its own milestone in this lane's report.
- **Two harnesses is not coverage of 68 programs.** The editor's editing operations are the richest
  untrusted-input surface left in `user/` and are out of reach as the document is laid out today;
  moving a row's length out of the row would fix that and is a data-layout question, not a lane's.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 212.** `script/falsifications` walked `crates/` only, so this milestone's record under
  `user/` was uncounted and milestone 193's kernel harnesses carried none at all, while the script
  printed its ratio as if it were the tree's. The walk now comes from `cargo metadata`.
- **Refused.** Proving `xtask`. Its front door is already open, measured: `cargo kani -p xtask`
  compiles with no changes. The refusal is on value. A defect there cannot reach anything that runs,
  it is host code with tests and a debugger where Kani is least differentiated, its pure logic
  already lives in crates the suite proves, and its hand-written decoders exist to be a second
  opinion on those crates, so aiming one prover at both halves narrows the independence that
  justifies them. What would reverse it is `xtask` growing logic the target then trusts, and the
  shape to watch is the measured-boot digest.
- **Recorded.** `design/roadmap/197-user-and-xtask-proofs.md` BUGS: two harnesses is not coverage of
  68 programs. The editor's editing operations are the richest untrusted-input surface left in
  `user/` and are out of reach as the document is laid out today; moving a row's length out of the
  row would fix that, and it is a data-layout question rather than a lane's.
- **Recorded.** `notes/user-proofs.md` holds the three property shapes measured and abandoned rather
  than left as folklore: a bound on a sum of 32 symbolic values that did not finish in twenty
  minutes, a symbolic index into the editor's document struct that exhausted CBMC's memory in 3m23s,
  and anything downstream of twenty chained divisions. It is where the warning lives that a fast
  harness can be evidence the assertion asked nothing.
- **Proposed.** `design/roadmap/proposals/timer-rearm-seam.md`, Lift the timer re-arm arithmetic out
  of the register access so `crates/timetable`'s already proved `next_after` is what the timer
  actually calls. Where the seam goes is calef's: too high and the arch layer keeps the milestone 6
  drift bug, too low and every ISA restates it. Until it moves, the tree's sharpest counterfactual
  is a property proved over code that nothing runs.
