# 472. A bench console that can power-cycle a board

**Status: REFUSED.** Refused by milestone 216 (design/roadmap/216-board-console.md), and recorded
there on 2026-09-03. Backfilled here on 2026-09-20 by
milestone 448 (design/roadmap/448-a-refusal-gets-a-number.md), which gave a refusal that names work a number, a
status and a condition that would change it. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**The date is when the refusal was written down, not necessarily when it was made.** Most of this
tree's `- **Refused.**` bullets were written in one sweep on 2026-09-03, so the decision is usually
older than the bullet and its reasoning sits in the block's own prose above it.

## The refusal, in its own words

From '216. Nothing in this tree can read a board, so every hardware milestone waits on a person',
under `## Follow-on`:

> Making the tool drive power. A tool that power-cycles is a different and more dangerous object
> than one that reads, and the outlet next to the board's on that strip feeds an external drive
> that must never be switched off. The built tool reads and never writes, to the port or to the
> outlet, so the question stayed undecided rather than being settled by an implementation.

## Why it is here rather than only there

`board_console` reads a board and never writes, to the port or to the outlet. Power is the obvious
next verb and it is a different and more dangerous object: the outlet next to radon's on that strip
feeds an external drive that must never be switched off, and a tool that can switch an outlet can
switch that one.

## Revisit

- **Unstated.** The refusal deliberately leaves the question undecided rather than settling it by
  implementation, and it names a hazard rather than a condition. It is calef's call, and what a reader
  needs before it can be made is not a trigger but an answer about whether a reading tool should ever
  hold a writing authority. The hazard is on the record here so that it cannot be rediscovered the
  expensive way.

## Index row

The tool reads and never writes, on purpose, and the reason is a specific outlet on a specific strip
that feeds a drive nobody can afford to switch off. The question of whether it should ever drive
power was left open rather than answered by shipping, and this keeps it open where it can be found.
