# 393. Four files each record which crates cannot compile for the host, and one of them derives it

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Filed 2026-09-12 as an unnumbered proposal from milestone 278's block,
which touches all four lists and would have made it five; numbered 2026-09-19 by milestone 433's
drain of the proposal pile. **Premise re-read against the tree on 2026-09-19 and still true, all
four still present**: `script/lint` carries `--exclude user_mode_runtime` and its siblings by hand
in two clippy invocations (lines 41 and 120) *and* derives the same set for its own gate (line 812,
"the host pass excludes exactly the bare-metal crates"); `xtask/src/main.rs` carries the list twice
(lines 5133 and 5789); `script/coverage` carries it twice (lines 70 and 100); and
`.cargo/mutants.toml` still says in its own head comment that its list "deliberately mirrors
script/coverage's exclusions". One place derives it and the rest restate it, which is the whole
block. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**Gate: NONE.** `script/lint` already derives the set for its own check, so the hard half exists;
what is missing is the other three consuming that derivation instead of restating it.

**In brief.** A crate that reaches `crates/user_mode_runtime` cannot compile for the host, because `svc` and
`ecall` from EL0 on a machine with no nife kernel under it are a fault. Four separate places record
which crates those are: `script/lint`'s two clippy invocations, `xtask`'s `test`, `script/coverage`'s
exclusions, and `.cargo/mutants.toml`'s. **`script/lint` asks cargo.** The other three carry a list.

## Why this matters

This has already broken once, and the way it broke is the argument. The exclusion set went wrong on
**2026-08-03 and stayed wrong until 2026-08-14**, invisible for eleven days, because CI had moved to
an aarch64 runner the same day, where the EL0 assembly compiles by accident. `script/lint`'s own
header records that, and the derived check it now runs is the repair.

Milestone 244 then found the repair had covered **two consumers, not four**, and that the two it had
missed are the two that publish a number: coverage and mutation. `.cargo/mutants.toml` says in its
own head comment that its list "deliberately mirrors script/coverage's exclusions" and asks the next
person to keep the two in step. That is rung four of the ladder, in a file whose output is quoted in
a fatal risk's verdict.

Milestone 278 moves two modules out of `user_mode_runtime` into a crate that *can* compile for the host, which
means editing all four lists in one change. A fifth list would be added by the next milestone that
splits anything.

## The shape

`script/lint` already runs the derivation: ask cargo which workspace members reach `user_mode_runtime`, and
check every consumer excludes every one. Two ways to close the class, and choosing is the work:

- **Emit the set.** One command prints the exclusion list, and `script/coverage`, `xtask test` and
  the mutants config consume it rather than restate it. `.cargo/mutants.toml` is static TOML, which
  is the awkward one and may need generating or a `--exclude` passed at the call site instead.
- **Keep the lists and keep the check.** Weaker, and it is roughly today's state with the gate
  widened to four consumers, which milestone 244 already did. The remaining defect is that four
  files still have to agree; the gate only tells you after they stop.

The first is the higher rung. The second is honest about cost and should say so out loud if chosen.

## What this is not

It is not a change to the exclusion itself. `user_mode_runtime` is correctly excluded and stays excluded;
milestone 278's argument is that the *boundary* is in the wrong place, not that the rule is wrong.

## BUGS

- **Nobody has priced the `.cargo/mutants.toml` half**, which is the one that decides between the two
  shapes. Static TOML cannot read a command's output, so either the file is generated (and then a
  generated file is checked in, which this tree has opinions about) or the exclusions move to the
  `script/mutation` call site and the file stops being the record. Both are defensible and neither
  has been measured.

## Index row

A crate that reaches `crates/user_mode_runtime` cannot compile for the host, because `svc` and
`ecall` from EL0 on a machine with no nife kernel under it are a fault, and four separate files
record which crates those are: `script/lint`'s two clippy invocations, `xtask`'s `test`,
`script/coverage`'s exclusions and `.cargo/mutants.toml`'s. `script/lint` asks cargo; the other
three carry a list. This has already broken once and the way it broke is the argument: the exclusion
set went wrong on 2026-08-03 and stayed wrong until 2026-08-14, invisible for eleven days, because
CI had moved to an aarch64 runner the same day, where the EL0 assembly compiles by accident.
Milestone 244 then found the repair had covered two consumers rather than four, and that the two it
missed are the two that publish a number, coverage and mutation, with `.cargo/mutants.toml` asking
the next person in a comment to keep it in step with `script/coverage`, which is rung four in a file
whose output is quoted in a fatal risk's verdict. Two ways to close the class and choosing is the
work: emit the derived set and have the other three consume it, or keep the lists and keep the gate
widened, which is roughly today's state and only tells you after they have stopped agreeing. The
first is the higher rung; the awkward half is that `.cargo/mutants.toml` is static TOML, so either
it is generated or the exclusions move to the `script/mutation` call site and the file stops being
the record.
