# 45. Triage the CodeQL code-scanning alerts, and decide what the tool is for

**Status: BUILT.**

**Built 2026-07-30. All nine alerts are fixed, and the policy is DECISIONS §35.** The seven
`actions/missing-workflow-permissions` went first: every CI job held a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with permissions
it never used, which is an odd default for a project whose thesis is that a component holds the
authority its job needs and nothing more.

The two `rust/access-invalid-pointer` alerts turned out to be two different findings wearing one label.
**Nullness was structurally fixable and the type was failing to say so**: every pointer entering the
intrusive queues comes from a `&mut Thread`, so non-nullness is a fact of construction rather than a
caller's promise. `Fifo`, `Endpoint` and the `Node` trait moved to `NonNull`, every conversion at every
call site is infallible (`NonNull::from`, never `NonNull::new(..).unwrap()`), and `Option<NonNull<T>>`
is the same size as `*mut T` through the niche, so it costs nothing. **Validity and aliasing remain
inexpressible**, which is the design of an intrusive queue rather than a gap, and that reasoning now
lives in the crate's own docs as the standing caveat.

Two things recorded because they were wrong or nearly so. I predicted twice that `NonNull` would improve
the code *without* satisfying CodeQL, reasoning that the rule was about validity generally; it cleared
both alerts, so the rule was more precise than I credited. And I first "proved" that with a query
against `refs/heads/<branch>`, which has **zero analyses**, so it would have returned zero whatever the
code did. The real comparison is `/language:rust`: 2 results on `refs/heads/main`, 0 on
`refs/pull/5/head`, holding across four commits each side.


**In brief.** Nine alerts on first run. Seven (`actions/missing-workflow-permissions`) were fixed immediately by giving every workflow an explicit least-privilege `permissions: contents: read`, which is the right call for this repo specifically: a project whose thesis is that a component holds the authority its job needs and nothing more has no business letting its CI token default to write access it never uses. **The two that remain are high severity and need judgement, not configuration**: `rust/access-invalid-pointer` at `crates/intrusive/src/lib.rs:93` and `:109`, the raw-pointer dereferences in the intrusive wait-queue's `push_back` and `pop_front`. Both already carry `SAFETY` comments citing the queue's caller contract, and `intrusive` is one of the 13 Kani-proved crates, so the question is precisely what CodeQL sees that Kani does not: Kani proves the pure logic under chosen bounds, while the pointer validity here rests on a *caller* contract enforced by convention rather than by the type system. Decide per alert whether it is a true positive worth restructuring for, or a false positive to dismiss **with a written reason**; then set the standing policy for how alerts get triaged, since an alert list nobody dispositions decays into wallpaper

**Why it matters.** **the alerts land exactly where this project's most-used unsafe abstraction lives**, so the answer is worth having either way: either the wait queue's contract can be made structural rather than documented, which is a real improvement to the code every blocked thread passes through, or we write down why it cannot be and what upholds it instead. Also forces the meta-decision milestone 44 left open, now that scanning is actually running: a scanner whose findings are never dispositioned is worse than none, because it manufactures the appearance of review

## Follow-on

- **Recorded.** `crates/intrusive_fifo/src/lib.rs` carries the standing caveat: pointer validity and
  aliasing in the intrusive queue remain inexpressible. `NonNull` made nullness structural and
  cleared both alerts, and what upholds the rest is the kernel's state machine rather than any type,
  which the crate says out loud rather than letting two green checkmarks imply safety.
