# 502. A witness bit set is held together by a hand-written list, and the list has gone stale twice

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)* Promoted from the
proposal `a-witness-bit-set-has-no-mechanism`, filed 2026-09-19, on calef's instruction of
2026-09-20 to give every proposal on `main` a number. The text below is the proposal's own, unedited
except for this paragraph: the argument is its author's and promotion is not the moment to improve
it. Found by milestone 326 (nobody has been assigned to turn a) while triaging the 2026-09-14 mutation census. It is not that milestone's
work: 326 fixed the two lists it found broken, which is rung four again.

**Gate: NONE.** Everything it needs is in `crates/filesystem_protocol` and a `macro_rules!`.

## In brief

The in-QEMU confinement tests report their outcome as a bitmask. `fixture::navscape` has 32 bits,
`fixture::dirscape` 17, `fixture::attrs` 9, `fixture::escape` 8, `fixture::globscape` 7,
`fixture::twodir` 6, each declared as `pub const NAME: u64 = 1 << n;` and each module carrying an
`EXPECTED` constant that ors together the ones a correct run reports.

**A bit that is zero is a probe that reports nothing while its boot passes.** Nothing in the
declaration stops two bits sharing an `n`, and nothing stops a constant being wrong. What stands
between the tree and that is one host test per module, each a **hand-written list of the module's
names**, checked for distinctness and non-zero.

**The list is rung four of AGENTS.md's ladder and it has failed twice in the one module that logs
it.** `the_navigation_bits_are_distinct`'s own body carries this comment, written on 2026-08-24:

> These six were added after this list was last touched (touch's create half on 2026-08-22, its
> mtime half on 2026-08-24) and neither addition updated it; adding them now rather than leaving
> the gap for a seventh.

The seventh, eighth and ninth arrived on 2026-08-30 (`BIND_REACHED_TARGET`,
`BIND_ASCEND_REACHES_REAL_PARENT`, `BIND_STOPS_AT_TRUE_ROOT`) and the list was not updated. This
time nobody read it either: it was the mutation run of 2026-09-19 that said so, because `1 << 29`
under `>>` is zero and no test noticed. And `fixture::twodir` has never had such a test at all, so
five of its six bits could each be zero, two of them the structural finding
`notes/dir-capability.md` records.

## What to build

**A declaration macro, so the list cannot be separate from the constants.** Something of this shape,
in `crates/filesystem_protocol`:

```rust
witness_bits! {
    /// It opened the file inside the first grant, through the first grant's own endpoint.
    OPENED_A,
    /// It opened the file inside the second grant, through the second grant's own endpoint.
    OPENED_B,
    ...
}
```

expanding to the same `pub const NAME: u64 = 1 << n;` declarations it does today, numbered by
position, plus `pub const ALL: &[(&str, u64)]` naming them. Then one generic test per module walks
`ALL`, and **a bit that is not in the list cannot exist**, because the list is where bits come from.
That is rung one for the numbering (a position cannot collide with itself) and rung two for the rest.

**The names stay exactly as they are.** This is a change to how they are written down, not to what
they are called; every constant keeps its spelling, its doc comment and its value, and `EXPECTED`
keeps being written by hand because which bits a correct run reports is a claim rather than a
derivation.

## What this does not do, and the honest limits

- **It does not check that a bit means what its name says.** Only the in-QEMU boot can do that, and
  a witness that sets the wrong bit is still a witness that lies. This closes "a bit is zero or
  shared with another", which is the failure that has actually happened.
- **It does not reach the other crates.** `crates/swish` and the kernel's own test vocabularies have
  bit sets of the same shape; whether the macro should live somewhere both can reach is a question
  for whoever takes this, and putting it in `filesystem_protocol` first is the cheaper start.
- **A macro is a thing to read**, and AGENTS.md's elegance tenet refuses machinery for tidiness. The
  argument for this one is that it *removes* a thing to remember rather than adding an abstraction:
  six hand-maintained lists become zero.

## Prior art in this tree

`crates/filesystem_protocol`'s `verb::TABLE` already does the stronger version of this for opcodes:
two `const _: () = { .. }` blocks assert at compile time that the table is complete and in opcode
order, so a verb added to `fs` without a row fails the build. The bit sets are the same problem with
no such block, and the reason is only that they are constants rather than a table.

## BUGS

- **It cannot be gated into existence.** A module that declines the macro and writes its constants
  by hand compiles fine, and a lint that looked for `1 << n` in a `fixture` module would have to
  know which ones are witness bits and which are ordinary flags. So this is rung one for the modules
  that adopt it and rung zero for a module that does not, which is worth knowing before anyone calls
  it solved.
