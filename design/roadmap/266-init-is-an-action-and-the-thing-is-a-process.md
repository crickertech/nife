# 266. One progenitor, on all three architectures, and `init` stops being a role

**Status: BUILT** 2026-09-08. Minted the same day by calef, who refused the guard rail that had been
quoted at him: *"init still isn't a good name even though it comes with history. This is the first process."*
*(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

It gated on nothing while it ran: the rename needed nobody's permission. The sequencing below was
not optional, and milestone 265's block carries the same constraint for the same reason.

## The argument, which turns on a word in the rule rather than against it

AGENTS.md protects **standard terms that are genuinely right** and says a name a reader already knows
from outside is the best available. The maintainer quoted that at `init` and calef's answer was that
`init` is not genuinely right, only **familiar**:

- **It names an action for a thing.** `init` is short for *initialize*, a verb, and AGENTS.md's own
  rule is *name things with nouns*, because a verb names an action and a process is not one.
- **The thing is the first process**, the one the kernel starts and from which every other descends,
  and the name says none of that.
- **Familiarity is not correctness.** `elf` is genuinely right because that is the format's name.
  `pci` is genuinely right because the expansion teaches nothing better. `init` is a truncated verb
  that a reader recognises from Unix, which is a different thing from a name that is right.

**And in this tree the role is larger than Unix's**, which sharpens it. `crates/system_initializer`:
*"The kernel loads this as the boot process, maps the initrd, and grants it the capabilities...
**From those, and nothing else, it builds the whole interactive system out of its own budget.**"* So
the first process here is not merely first in time; it holds the machine's entire authority at boot
and hands slices away. Milestone 22 is called trusted init for that reason, and
[§32](../decisions/32-reap-without-build.md)'s fork about whether a supervisor can restart without
regaining construction authority is the same subject. *(That citation named decision 148 when this
block was minted, a number no decision has, and `script/decisions --check` failed on it from the
moment the block landed. Corrected by this milestone's lane. Written without the section sigil on
purpose: spelling it would make this sentence itself a dangling citation, which is the gate working
as designed.)*

## The name

**`progenitor`.** Ratified by calef 2026-09-08.

- **It is the ancestor every process descends from**, which is the actual relationship rather than a
  position in a sequence.
- **It matches the house style**, which is overwhelming: `builder`, `spawner`, `supervisor`,
  `caretaker`, `undertaker`, `provisioner`, `reviver`, `surveyor`, `responder`, `editor`,
  `initializer`. Thirty-odd agent nouns. A role here is named for who does the thing.

**`prime` was calef's own first suggestion and he set it aside on the argument against it.** In
English it usually means *chief* or *best* (prime minister, prime rib) rather than first in sequence,
and in a tree carrying Argon2, GUIDs and CRC polynomials a systems reader meets `prime` and thinks
number theory. That is a decoder problem, which is the failure mode the naming rule refuses.

**`origin` and `first` were considered.** `origin` captures what makes the role load-bearing here and
is not an agent noun; `first` is unambiguous and generic enough to sit with `compose` and `measure`
in the words that could name anything.

## What is in scope: one program, not a relabelling

**calef, 2026-09-08: one progenitor for all three architectures.** The rename falls out of that
rather than preceding it, and the reason is that **the role exists to abstract over several
implementations and there should not be several.**

Today three programs stand behind one archive entry:

| | what it is |
|---|---|
| `hello` | *"one binary, two roles"* that grew into the milestone 7-19 catalogue. On aarch64 the archive packs it **as** `init`, because that is where the PL011 wiring already was |
| `builder` | *"a minimal init... deliberately small and fully portable"*, which exists to prove on a second ISA that **userspace, not the kernel, composes the system** |
| `system_initializer` | the full one: console, input driver, line discipline, shell, sink adapter and job undertaker, then resident as the spawn service |

**The alias layer is what makes them look like one thing, and it is already wrong.**
`crates/system_initializer` says the entry `init` *"is `fixtures/src/hello.rs`'s `init_boot` role on
aarch64 and this program on riscv64"*, while `xtask`'s `portable_archive_entries()` maps
`("init", "builder")` and lists `system_initializer` separately. One of those is stale, **and the
contradiction exists because there is an alias to be stale about.** Collapse the alias and the class
goes with it: the kernel looks up `progenitor`, and `progenitor` is the program.

### The parity violation, stated as the tree states it

`hello` is **not** a one-platform program: it is in the riscv64 and x86_64 archives under its own
name. What is aarch64-only is its **init role**, and `fixtures/src/hello.rs` records what that cost in
its own comment:

> aarch64 packs `hello` as `init`, because there hello *is* [init]... This was a hardcoded `"init"`,
> which is **right on aarch64 and silently wrong on RISC-V**

That is [§19](../decisions/19-architectural-parity.md)'s own failure mode, *a feature that works on
one ISA and silently not another*, and the bill was paid once already:
`crates/system_initializer` records a fix landing in one and not the other presenting as **"a boot
that reached userspace and printed nothing at all, with no fault and no message."**

**So the violation is not that `hello` exists. It is that one architecture's first process is a role
bolted inside a demo binary while the others get a purpose-built one.**

### What survives

- **`hello` stays, on all three, as the demo catalogue it actually is.** One role moves out of it,
  on one architecture. Milestone 96 already lifted the shared construction into
  `crates/system_initializer`, so what moves is a boot entry rather than logic.
- **`builder` stays as itself** if it still earns its keep: it is a demonstrator artifact with its
  own argument, not a third init. The lane should say whether that argument still holds once one
  progenitor exists, and **not delete it silently** if it does not.

### The one genuine difference to reconcile

`crates/system_initializer` names it exactly: the boot entry is *"the one thing the two boards
genuinely disagree about, which is **the order their kernels grant capabilities in**."* One
difference. A `cfg` may be the right answer and the lane should argue it rather than reach for it.

## The measurement, so nobody starts by guessing

Taken 2026-09-08.

| what | count |
|---|---|
| the contract string `"init"` in `kernel/`, `crates/`, `xtask/` | **39** |
| `initboot` | 29 |
| `init_boot` and `INIT_BOOT` | 14 |
| `INIT_ROLES_ENTRY` | 8 |
| `init_least_authority_demo` | 3 |
| **the word `init` in `notes/` and `design/` prose** | **1,011** |
| files and directories named for it | 6, including three notes and `design/init-and-granular-spawn.md` |

**The contract is small and the prose is the work.** Thirty-nine sites is an afternoon. **The 1,011
is a judgement per occurrence** and cannot be done by a pattern: *"userspace init brings up the
console"* is the role, *"trusted init"* is milestone 22's title, `notes/trusted-init.md` is a
filename, and a great many are the ordinary English sense of initialisation. **This is precisely the
shape a blind `sed` has damaged this tree with before**, when one swept a rename tree-wide and
rewrote the row recording that a name had been *refused*.

## What a lane must do rather than assume

- **Read every prose occurrence.** A pattern that changes 1,011 things is wrong by construction.
  Report how many were the role, how many were English, and how many were historical titles left
  alone.
- **Leave records that describe the past.** Milestone titles, dated audit rows and measurement
  tables recorded what was true under the name it had, and rewriting them makes the record lie. The
  `cred` rename on 2026-09-08 set that precedent and named the files it left alone.
- **Rename the three notes and one design file only if their subject is the role**, and say so
  either way. `notes/trusted-init.md` is milestone 22's record and its title may be history.
- **Check the archive manifest in `xtask` first, not last.** It is the copy no compiler checks, and
  it is what broke CI on the `job_mix_task` rename on 2026-09-05.

## A contradiction to resolve on the way

`crates/system_initializer`'s header says the archive entry `init` *"is `fixtures/src/hello.rs`'s
`init_boot` role on aarch64 and this program on riscv64"*, while `xtask`'s
`portable_archive_entries()` maps `("init", "builder")` and lists `system_initializer` as a separate
entry. **One of those is stale and this block does not know which.** Settle it and say so; a rename
that carries a wrong claim forward has spent the opportunity to find it.

## BUGS

- **This is a kernel-to-image contract**, which AGENTS.md puts in the expensive category alongside a
  wire format. The edit is easy and the un-shipping is not, and nothing outside this repository has
  acted on it, which is the only reason it is cheap today.
- **`init` is the one name a stranger arrives already knowing**, and that cost is real rather than
  rhetorical. Every other rename in this sweep replaced a name nobody outside knew.
- **The 1,011 figure is a word count, not a role count.** Nobody knows how many are the role, and
  the lane's first honest deliverable is that number.
- **`initboot`'s successor is unnamed.** `progenitor-boot` is the mechanical answer and it is a
  mouthful, and naming the boot path for what it does rather than which role it hands to may be
  better. That is a decision this block defers rather than makes.

## What was built

**One program, three architectures, one name.** `components/src/progenitor.rs` is the first process on
aarch64, riscv64 and x86_64. The kernel looks up the archive entry `progenitor` and enters it; there
is no alias and no class of thing for an alias to be stale about.

Two commits, in that order, and the separation is the point rather than tidiness. The first makes
`system_initializer` the boot program on all three boards under the old entry name, so a boot failure
belongs to the structure. The second renames. `script/shell-check` is green on both legs at each of
them, which is the only way that separation is worth anything.

### The contradiction, settled

**`crates/system_initializer`'s header was the stale one.** It said the entry `init` *"is
`fixtures/src/hello.rs`'s `init_boot` role on aarch64 and this program on riscv64"*, and the second half
was wrong: `xtask`'s `portable_archive_entries()` mapped `("init", "builder")` and listed
`system_initializer` as its own entry, which is what the archive actually contained. On riscv64 the
entry `init` was **milestone 20's `builder` demo**, and `system_initializer` was reached by its own
name from `riscv_shell_boot`. So `init` did not mean two things, it meant three: hello's boot role,
the builder demo, and (in the header's telling) the system builder.

The reason the header could be wrong for that long is the reason the milestone exists. The claim was
prose beside a program, and nothing compared it to the table; the alias is what made the two
describable separately.

### The one genuine difference, argued rather than reached for

A `cfg` is right, and it is one `cfg` over **data**, not over code. What the two kernels disagree
about is the *order* they grant boot capabilities in, so the slot numbers differ: aarch64's path is
shared with milestone 19d's test roles and carries a report endpoint and a test interrupt at slots 1
and 3 that the interactive system never uses, and everything after them is numbered around that.

Three alternatives were considered and each lost to the same objection.

- **Make the kernels agree.** The better fix in the abstract, and it moves the aarch64 test roles'
  slot numbering, which six `spawn_progenitor` tests and `hello`'s whole 19d catalogue are written
  against. That is a real milestone, not a line in this one, and it is proposed below.
- **Probe at runtime.** `system_initializer::boot` already probes for absent capabilities, so the
  machinery exists. It cannot work here: the ambiguity is not "is slot 9 empty", it is "is slot 9 the
  virtio-rng transport or the graphical terminal's endpoint", and nothing distinguishes those from
  inside the process.
- **Pass the table in.** The kernel could write the endowment into the configuration page. That puts
  a layout two programs agree on into a runtime channel to avoid a compile-time constant, which is
  the wrong direction on `DECISIONS`' own dependency argument, and it makes the boot depend on a page
  the boot is what sets up.

So: data under a `cfg`, in one file, beside the other board's table where a reader meets both.

### `builder` survives, and the argument holds

It is packed under its own name now, on riscv64 and x86_64, and the RISC-V boot tour enters it
directly. Its claim is *"userspace, not the kernel, composes the system"*, proven on a second ISA in
the smallest form that can prove it, and one progenitor does not retire that claim: the progenitor
proves the same thing while also being the interactive system, so it proves it **less** cleanly. A
reader who wants to see the composition model with nothing else in the frame reads `builder`.

What it stops being is a boot program with a boot program's name. It was the entry called `init` on
two of three archives, which is most of how `init` came to mean different binaries on different
boards.

## The prose count, which was the milestone's own first deliverable

The block predicted 1,011 occurrences of the word `init` in `notes/` and `design/` and said the
count of *roles* among them was the lane's first honest deliverable. Measured on the base commit:
**1,005** as a whole word, and **1,988** as a substring.

| what | count |
|---|---|
| the role, in prose | **748** |
| the archive entry, as a literal (`` `init` ``, `"init"`) | 116 |
| kernel functions that are not this role at all (`mmu::init`, `arch::iommu::init`, ...) | 76 |
| titles, filenames and paths (`notes/trusted-init.md`, `target/init-measure-<arch>.txt`, five roadmap slugs) | 65 |
| **changed by this milestone** | **18** |

**The block's third bucket does not exist, and that is worth recording rather than quietly
dropping.** It predicted "a great many are the ordinary English sense of initialisation". None are:
`initrd`, `initial`, `initialize` and `initializer` are not matched by a word-boundary search for
`init`, and they are exactly the 983 occurrences that separate the substring count from the word
count. The English sense is real, it is large, and it was never in the 1,011 to begin with. The
1,011 was measured with a different tool than the sentence describing it assumed.

**Eighteen changed of 748 roles, and the policy is the deliverable rather than the number.** The rule
applied, stated so it can be disagreed with:

- **A pointer changes.** An identifier, a path, an archive entry name, a transcript string: if a
  reader would grep it and find nothing, it is a dangling reference and a defect. `spawn_init`,
  `boot_via_init`, `INIT_ROLES_ENTRY`, `INIT_BOOT_ROLE` and `user/src/system_initializer.rs` were
  swept everywhere they appear, including inside dated logs, because a dead pointer in a log is
  still dead.
- **A present-tense claim about the system changes**, because it is now false. Three were:
  `notes/grant-expression.md`'s *"There are still two inits"*, `notes/trusted-init.md`'s
  *"`user::initrd()` loads the archive entry `init`, which is..."*, and `notes/naming.md`'s *"the one
  deliberate exception"*.
- **A record of what was true on a date does not change.** This is the `cred`-to-`credentialer`
  precedent from the same week, and the reason is that rewriting it makes the record lie. Milestone
  22's title is *trusted init*; `notes/pipes.md`'s section heading *"A correction: there are two
  inits"* is the correction it records; `notes/trusted-init.md` carries captured boot transcripts
  whose bytes are evidence.
- **A file a developer may not edit does not change**, and that is a larger share of the 748 than any
  judgement call: 371 of the remaining occurrences are in other milestones' roadmap blocks and 100
  are in `design/decisions/`, both of which AGENTS.md puts outside a lane's reach.

## Follow-on

- **Proposed.** `design/roadmap/proposals/one-grant-order-for-the-progenitor.md`. The `cfg` above is honest and it is
  still two orders for one endowment; unifying them means renumbering aarch64's 19d test roles,
  which is its own milestone with its own gate. Until then the tables sit beside each other in
  `components/src/progenitor.rs`, which is the cheapest place to notice they disagree.
- **Proposed.** `design/roadmap/proposals/what-the-boot-path-is-called.md`. Held out of this milestone deliberately (`script/initboot` to
  `init-boot` was staged and backed out pending it), and it is three strings in two naming domains:

  | thing | today | domain | mechanical answer |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `script/initboot` | `initboot` | shell command, hyphens | `progenitor-boot` |
  | `cargo xtask initboot` | `initboot` | shell command, hyphens | `progenitor-boot` |
  | the kernel Cargo feature | `initboot` | Rust identifier, `snake_case` | `progenitor_boot` |

  **The recommendation is not the mechanical answer.** The boot path is named after the role it hands
  to, and once the role has a nine-letter name that reads as a mouthful three times over. What the
  flag actually selects is *skip the milestone tour and hand off immediately*, which is a property of
  the boot rather than of who receives it: its sibling `shell` is named that way already, for the
  thing you get rather than for the program that builds it. So `handoff` / `handoff` / `handoff` is
  worth calef's consideration beside `progenitor-boot`. Either way it is his call, and `jobmix` has
  the same unratified-squish defect beside it.
- **Proposed.** `design/roadmap/proposals/the-crate-behind-the-progenitor.md`. `crates/system_initializer` is this
  program's logic lifted out, which AGENTS.md says is exactly the relationship a shared name records,
  and the program is `progenitor` now. calef's own argument for the rename (`init` names an action,
  the thing is a process) applies unchanged to `initializer`. Not performed here: `system_initializer`
  was ratified 2026-08-01 and only `progenitor` was ratified for this milestone.
- **Recorded.** *`HELLO_ENTRY` and `PROGENITOR_ROLE` are provisional*, marked as such at their
  definitions. `HELLO_ENTRY` was already the spelling `kernel::user::tests` used.
- **Recorded.** *`notes/trusted-init.md` keeps its name.* Its subject is milestone 22, whose title is
  *trusted init*, and its filename is that title. The loading note did not keep its own: its subject
  is the role rather than a milestone, so it is `notes/progenitor-and-loading.md` now and its six
  citations moved with it.

## BUGS

- **`init` was the one name a stranger arrived already knowing, and that cost is now paid rather than
  predicted.** Every other rename in this sweep replaced a name nobody outside knew. A reader who has
  used Unix will look for `init` in the archive and in the process list and not find it. Nothing in
  the tree currently redirects them, and the honest mitigation is that `progenitor` appears in the
  boot transcript's first lines, where `init:` used to.
- **The boot transcript prefix changed**, from `init: ` to `progenitor: `, in
  `crates/system_initializer`. `script/shell-check` matches those strings exactly and moved with
  them. Anyone with a saved transcript, or a script grepping one, sees a different word.
- **Dangling references remain in `design/`, and they are not oversights.** 471 occurrences of the
  word sit in other milestones' roadmap blocks and in `design/decisions/`, which a developer lane may
  not edit; among them are live citations of `spawn_init`, `boot_via_init`, `INIT_ROLES_ENTRY` and
  `INIT_BOOT_ROLE` (milestones 166, 177, 182, 161, 49 and 105, and decisions 21 and 120). They will
  not resolve against the tree until a maintainer sweeps them.
- **`notes/pipes.md` carries a dead path in a fixed-width diagram**, `user/src/system_initializer`,
  left because the diagram is aligned and dated. It is the one place a path was knowingly left broken.
- **The captured transcripts in `notes/trusted-init.md` still read `init:`.** They are evidence from
  a dated run and their bytes are the record, so they were not rewritten; a reader comparing them
  against a boot today will see a different prefix.
- **The grant orders still differ**, which is the `cfg` above. It is the one architectural difference
  left in the first process, and it is data rather than code, but it is still a thing two boards
  disagree about in a milestone whose whole point was that they should not.
