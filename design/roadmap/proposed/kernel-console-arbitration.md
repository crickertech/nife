# The kernel and the `console` server drive one UART from two address spaces, and nothing arbitrates

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-03.** Written by the milestone 247 sweep, from milestone 230's block.

**Gate: DECISION.** Where the kernel's own output goes once userspace owns the console is a design
fork rather than a bug to fix, and it is calef's. The options are genuinely different systems, not
variations on one, and the choice binds every architecture and every future console consumer.

**In brief.** Once the `console` server owns the console, two address spaces are writing to the same
UART with no arbitration between them. The kernel writes directly, because a kernel that cannot
print during a fault is a kernel nobody can debug, and the server writes on behalf of userspace. The
streams interleave at byte granularity. Deciding this means saying where kernel output goes: a
second port, a buffer the server drains, a claim the server takes and the kernel respects except in
a panic, or something else.

## Why this matters

It corrupts every bench session on argon, radon and xenon. A serial log is the only thing those
three machines can say, and milestone 216 built a tool whose whole contract is recognising a boot
sequence in that stream. Interleaved bytes break that contract in the least visible way available:
the log is present, it looks like output, and the line the tool is matching on has a kernel message
spliced through the middle of it. A gate that reads a board reads this.

It is also already load-bearing somewhere it cannot be fixed. Milestone 243's `BUGS` points at a
home for this question that does not exist, which is the tell AGENTS.md names for being on too low a
rung: a fact that lives only in a citation to nothing.

## What a lane can do before the ruling

The fork deserves its options priced rather than argued, and none of that needs a decision first.
What the kernel actually writes after userspace takes the console, and when, is a measurable list
rather than an opinion. Whether the boards have a second usable port is a hardware fact per board.
What a buffered path would cost during a panic, which is the case that matters most and the case a
buffer serves worst, is the constraint that probably decides it.

## Where it came from

Milestone 230 (`script/shell-check` is red on `main`) named it while fixing something else: *"Decide
where the kernel's own output goes once userspace owns the console. Today the kernel and the
`console` server drive the same UART from two address spaces with nothing arbitrating, so the
streams interleave at byte granularity. It corrupts every bench session on argon, radon and xenon,
and 243's BUGS points at a home that does not exist."*
