# 586. A prose ratchet in lint

**Status: PARTIAL.** Built on 2026-09-24 except the churn measurement, which needs a week. Minted by the maintainer on 2026-09-24, at the merge of the two decisions it
enforces: [§212 (a prose budget)](../decisions/212-a-prose-budget-for-every-document.md) and
[§213 (writing standards)](../decisions/213-writing-standards.md). calef ratified both on 2026-09-23.

**Gate: NONE.** Nothing blocks it. Both decisions are DECIDED and describe the check.

## Why one milestone serves both decisions

Each section asks for a gate, and the two gates are one mechanism with different counters. Both read
a document's main body with code fences stripped and blocks split before anything else is counted.
Both keep a per-file baseline that may not rise, the shape of the unsafe-count ratchet already in the
tree. Both let a new document, or one rewritten wholesale, meet the standard outright. And both
accept a marked exception carrying its reason. Building them as two milestones would build the
markdown body reader and the baseline file twice, or sequence one lane behind the other for no gain.

The decisions stay separate because they bound different things. The gate does not need to be.

## What it would be

A check in `script/lint` that measures every markdown document in the tree and compares it with a
committed baseline:

- Words of main body, against §212's 3,000-word cap. Appendices are measured under the same cap.
- Median and longest sentence, against §213's 20 and 40 words.
- Bold spans per 1,000 words, against §213's 4, reported as two counts: bold that opens a line and
  bold inline. They have different fixes.
- An orphan check: an appendix nothing links to fails, since §212's convention manufactures exactly
  that failure if nothing watches.

A document at or under every limit passes. A document over a limit passes only if it did not get
worse against its baseline, or carries a marked exception with a reason.

## The trap it inherits

Sentence splitting must respect block boundaries first. §213 records a naive pass that let a
paragraph's last sentence swallow the next heading. It reported a corpus median of 30 words where the
truth was 20. A gate built on that splitter fails documents that pass.

Markup a script parses, such as a roadmap block's `**Status:` line, counts as bold under §213. That
is a marked exception in §213's `BUGS`, not a carve-out the gate should invent. Decision files no
longer carry one: #1195 moved their status into YAML frontmatter on 2026-09-24, and the gate strips
frontmatter before it counts anything, so a decision's status is neither words nor bold.

## Design note, 2026-09-24: quoted text is exempt from the sentence limits

The sentence-length check must not count text inside quotation marks against the 40-word limit or
the median. A verbatim quote cannot be rewrapped. Splitting it changes what the speaker said, and
the tree's quotation convention (and `script/citations`, for attributed quotes) holds quotes word
for word.

The evidence is `notes/stranger-test/run-5.md`, condensed to §213 on 2026-09-24. Its only sentence
over 40 words is a stranger's worst-thing answer, quoted verbatim in `*"..."*`. Every other
sentence in that file and its seven sibling appendices was brought under the limit. A gate without
this exemption would fail that file for the one sentence it must not change.

The exemption covers the quoted span, not the sentence around it. A lead-in wrapped around a quote
is still prose and is still measured with the quote removed. Bold inside a quote still counts, since
bold is the writer's markup rather than the speaker's.

## Design note, 2026-09-24: an exception marker's count must match the file

A marked exception records the word count calef granted. Nothing compares that number with the
file afterwards, and the 2026-09-24 documentation audit found both marked exceptions past it the
same day they were granted. `design/fatal-risks.md` was granted 4,235 words and measured 4,440, after
a correction to risk 2 landed. `AGENTS.md`'s marker says 6,279 and the file measured 6,292. The gate
should treat the marker's number as the file's baseline: growth past it fails like growth past any
other baseline, and raising it is a new grant, which is calef's.

calef ruled the same day to cut `design/fatal-risks.md` back rather than raise its grant, and it is
back at 4,235 words, within the grant, as of 2026-09-24. `AGENTS.md` was not part of that ruling.

## What was built, 2026-09-24

The check is `helpers/prose_ratchet.py`, run by `script/lint` as "the prose ratchet". Its header is
the manual. The baseline is `design/prose-baseline.tsv`, one row per document over a limit.

- Scope. The document list is `script/metrics`' prose-budget scope, moved into the module so the
  gate and the graph share it. Appendices were added to it. The graph's scope had missed every
  appendix, though its docstring said it counted them; that changes the series by one document.
- Measures. Words of main body, median and longest sentence, and bold as two counts. Fenced code,
  HTML comments, frontmatter and generated tables are stripped first. Blocks are split before
  sentences. A bold span may wrap onto the next line of its paragraph and still counts once.
- The ratchet. Over a limit passes only at or under the baseline row. A document with no row meets
  the limits outright. It is also compared with the merge base, so an unbanked shrink leaves no
  room to regrow.
- The baseline only shrinks. Rows may not be added or raised against the merge base, and a row for
  a missing file fails. A rename carries its row. `--bank` lowers rows and never adds.
- Exceptions. `<!-- prose-budget: exception. ... -->` is honoured as `AGENTS.md` and
  `design/fatal-risks.md` already wrote it. `writing-standards` is its §213 twin and is provisional.
  Each needs a date and a `Reason:`.
- The orphan check. A file under `X/` must be linked from `X.md` or `X/README.md`. That README is
  the directory's provenance page and is exempt. A thematic
  directory, `design/tenets/` today, is listed in the module and checked against its README. It
  found one orphan, `notes/project-metrics/ledger.md`, now linked.
- A selftest runs first. It holds each trap the reader must avoid, and each was confirmed to fail
  when its rule was broken.

### Four choices a reader should know about

Bold is held as counts, not density. Density is bold over words, so condensing a document raises it.
A density ratchet would fail the work §212 asks for. Each count may not rise; cutting words is free.
This departs from §213's words, "bold density may not rise", and calef may overrule it.
calef overruled it on 2026-09-26 (UTC): a document a change touches is judged on density, and
whoever condenses a document removes its bold too. §213 records the ruling in his words.

Banking is lazy. A shrink does not force a baseline edit, because forced banking would put the
baseline in most pull requests. The merge-base comparison closes the slack instead.

The splitter differs from §213's in three ways, each a place the tree's prose broke it. A lowercase
word starts a sentence, since `calef` and the board names are lowercase. Inline code is one word,
since it is verbatim. Quoted text leaves before splitting, per the design note above. So its
corpus numbers run lower than §213's: the median document's median sentence is 17 words, not 20.

Median and density are not asked of documents under 200 words, §213's own floor. The longest
sentence is asked of every document.

### What it found on the day

The baseline holds 1,025 of 1,148 documents, regenerated from the tree it merged into. Longest
sentence is over in 905 and bold in 1,016. Words are over in 162 and the median in 178. Those counts are §212 and §213's debt, now held still.

New documents are the sharp edge. Of 209 added under this scope in the week to 2026-09-24, 163 would
have failed outright; 160 of those on bold, and only three because of parsed fields like `**Status:`.
So the gate will ask most new documents to change how they are written. That is what both decisions
ratified. When it was armed, 9 of 20 open pull requests would have failed it.

## What would make it not worth doing

If the baseline file churns on every pull request, the ratchet costs more attention than it saves.
Measuring that churn over the first week is part of the milestone.

## Follow-on

- **Outstanding.** Measure baseline churn over the first week, from 2026-09-24: how many merged pull
  requests touched `design/prose-baseline.tsv`, and why. The block names churn as the thing that would
  make this not worth doing, so that number decides whether it stays.
- **Outstanding.** Promote the two exception markers from provisional. The syntax is honoured as
  found; calef names it. Where the splitter departs from §213's, and why, is in the module's header.
- **Done.** Built 2026-09-25: the marker-count check from the design note above. `granted_words()`
  reads the first number before `words` in a `prose-budget` marker as a whole-file `wc -w` ceiling.
  It waited on `AGENTS.md`, which #1285 brought to its 6,097. `design/fatal-risks.md` had grown to
  4,250 against its 4,235 through milestone 89 (Scaleway EM-RV1)'s table cell (#1278). Per calef's
  ruling of 2026-09-24 it was cut back rather than re-granted, and `main` then passed.
- **Done.** Resolved 2026-09-25: every new decision failed this gate, because the generated index
  table in `design/decisions/README.md` counted as prose (found when the queue removed #1278). The
  gate now skips a table under a heading in `GENERATED_TABLES`, the one `script/decisions` anchors
  on, as it skips fenced code (aae40a98f). `script/metrics` counts through the same set. The
  README's row went from 5,242 words to within the cap.
- **Refused.** A list of parsed markup exempt from the bold count. The maintainer asked for one on
  2026-09-24, citing the `Status:` and `Gate:` lines roadmap blocks and proposals must carry. It
  would overturn a ruling, so it is calef's call and was not built. §213 records calef's ruling of the same day:
  parsed markup is counted, no exclusion was carved, and frontmatter is the likely answer. Measured
  cost: of 209 documents added in the week to 2026-09-24, three fail bold only because of parsed
  fields. Proposals are outside the scope, so #1233's is not checked at all. If calef rules for the
  list, it is a set of line patterns subtracted in `bold_counts()`, about ten lines.

## Index row

Decisions 212 (a prose budget) and 213 (writing standards) were ratified with a ratchet as their enforcement and no gate built. This builds one check in `script/lint` for both: main-body word count, median and longest sentence, and line-opening and inline bold density, each held to a per-file baseline that may not rise, plus an orphan check for appendices. One milestone because both gates share the block-aware markdown reader and the baseline mechanism.
