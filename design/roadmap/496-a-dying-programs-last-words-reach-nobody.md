# 496. A dying program's last words reach nobody

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)* Promoted from the
proposal `a-dying-programs-last-words-reach-nobody`, filed 2026-09-20, on calef's instruction of
2026-09-20 to give every proposal on `main` a number. The text below is the proposal's own, unedited
except for this paragraph: the argument is its author's and promotion is not the moment to improve
it. Written by the lane for milestone 442 (a crypto provider `rustls` can use on all three bare-
metal targets), which lost most of a day to this and then found that the thing it was chasing did
not exist.

**Gate: NONE.** Everything needed to reproduce it is in the tree.

## The correction this file exists to record

This proposal said something else on 2026-09-19. It claimed that a `std` program calling
`poly1305::Poly1305` directly **died before executing the first statement of `main`**, and it laid
out the evidence: an abort at `__rust_start_panic`, a clean three-segment binary, the failure
surviving every compiler flag. That claim was **false**, and the way it was false is the finding.

The program did not die early. It ran, printed six correct lines, reached a failing vector, panicked
with a perfectly clear message naming both values, and **nobody could read any of it.**

## What actually happens

`kernel/src/user/std_tests.rs`'s `drain_sink` reads the sink endpoint in a loop and stops on the
**end-of-stream marker**. That marker is sent by the std runtime's `cleanup`, which runs after
`main` returns. Under `panic = "abort"`, which every nife program uses, a panic runs the hook and
then executes a trap, so `cleanup` never runs and the marker is never sent.

So the reader blocks forever on an endpoint whose writer is dead, the watchdog eventually fires,
and the test prints **nothing at all**. Every byte the program wrote was delivered to that
rendezvous and thrown away.

**The symptom is indistinguishable from a program that never started**, which is exactly how it
was read, for a day, through a bisection that produced a coherent and entirely wrong story.

## Why it is worth a lane

**It defeats the one debugging tool a program has.** A nife program's only way to say anything is
`println!`, and this makes the failure case the case where that stops working. Every future lane
debugging a crashing `std` program will meet it, and the evidence it presents actively argues for
the wrong conclusion.

**The workaround belongs at the wrong layer.** `cryptography_exerciser` now installs a panic hook
that prints and calls `process::exit`, which makes `cleanup` run and the marker arrive. That works
and it is eight lines, but it is opt-in, per program, and remembered rather than enforced, which
AGENTS.md's ladder calls rung four.

## The shapes a fix could take

- **Let the reader stop when the writer is gone.** `drain_sink` already has the thread id at every
  call site. What it lacks is a non-blocking receive, or a pending count by rendezvous id: the hang
  diagnostic in `sched.rs` already reads exactly that count through `Rendezvous::debug_counts`, so
  the information exists and is simply not reachable from a test.
- **Send the marker on the way out of a fault.** The kernel reaps a faulted thread; whether it can
  or should flush that thread's sink is a capability question rather than an obvious yes.
- **Make the PAL's abort send it.** `sys::pal::nife`'s abort path could send end-of-stream before
  trapping. Smallest change, and it puts the fix where every program gets it without asking.

## BUGS

- **Nothing here is measured.** The three shapes above are sketched from reading, and none has been
  tried. The middle one in particular may be wrong for reasons the capability model will supply.
- **It is not only `drain_sink`.** Any reader of a nife program's sink has the same problem; this
  file names the one in the test harness because that is where it was met.
