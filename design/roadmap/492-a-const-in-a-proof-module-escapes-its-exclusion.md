# 492. A const inside a proof module is not excluded, because its mutant has no module path

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)* Promoted from the
proposal `a-const-in-a-proof-module-escapes-its-exclusion`, filed 2026-09-19, on calef's instruction
of 2026-09-20 to give every proposal on `main` a number. The text below is the proposal's own,
unedited except for this paragraph: the argument is its author's and promotion is not the moment to
improve it.

Found by milestone 438 while replaying `cargo mutants --in-diff`
against milestone 319's pull request: two of the four survivors it reported are mutants that
`cargo test` can never kill, in a module `cargo test` never compiles.

**Gate: NONE.** One entry in `.cargo/mutants.toml` and a paragraph saying why, which is the same
shape milestone 326 already used for `**/src/proofs.rs`. Nothing has to build or boot first.

**What is wrong.** `.cargo/mutants.toml` excludes the Kani and loom harness modules by
`exclude_re = ["verification::", "proofs::", "interleavings::"]`, matched against the mutant's
**name**. A function inside `#[cfg(kani)] mod verification` gets `verification::` in its name and is
excluded. A `const` or `static` inside the same module does not: cargo-mutants names its mutant by
the file and the operator alone, with no module path at all, so the regex has nothing to match.

```console
$ cargo mutants --list --workspace | grep 'x86_64.rs:314'
crates/machine_discovery/src/x86_64.rs:314:29: replace + with -
crates/machine_discovery/src/x86_64.rs:314:29: replace + with *
```

Line 314 is `const N: usize = V1_LEN + 1;`, four lines inside `#[cfg(kani)] mod verification`.

**How big it is: three mutants, today.** Cross-referencing the 9,656 mutants
`cargo mutants --list --workspace` generates against the line spans of every `#[cfg(kani)]` and
`#[cfg(all(test, loom))]` module in `crates/` and `components/` finds exactly three: the two above
and `crates/network_time_protocol/src/lib.rs:1323`, which is `const PROVED_NANOS: u64 = 1 << 16;`.
Most such items are plain literals or struct values with no operator to mutate, which is why the
number is small; it grows the next time a harness needs a computed bound.

**Why it is worth an entry rather than a shrug.** It is the third appearance of one defect.
Milestone 244 found `system_initializer` scored 191-mutants-0-caught because `--exclude` does not
remove a package from the dependency graph; milestone 280 found `uefi_loader`'s `[[bin]]` half
scored on a file nothing compiles; milestone 326 found 36 of `timetable`'s 48 survivors were its own
proof harnesses, because the module-path regex cannot see a module that is its own file. Each time
the number moved for a reason that was arithmetic rather than a finding, and each time it was found
by somebody triaging by hand. This one is the same defect keyed on the **item kind** instead of the
file layout.

**The shape of the fix, for whoever takes it.** A regex over the mutant name cannot express "inside
a `cfg`-gated module", because the name does not carry that. What the tree can express is the file
and line, which `exclude_globs` cannot reach either. So the honest options are a narrow name regex
per case (cheap, and it rots), or a `script/lint` check that does the cross-reference above and
fails when a mutant's line falls inside a `cfg(kani)` or `cfg(loom)` module span (rung two, and it
cannot rot). The second is what milestone 244's bare-metal gate already does one level over:
**derive the list rather than remember it.**

**What it blocks: nothing.** Three mutants is not a score. It is on the list because the same defect
has now cost four triages, and because a proof lane that trips it reads as a lane with untested code.
