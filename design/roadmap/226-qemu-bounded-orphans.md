# 226. `qemu-bounded.sh` leaves an emulator behind, and the next run blames the wrong thing

**Status: BUILT 2026-09-03.** Minted 2026-09-02 by the maintainer, from milestone 127's EL2 entry
lane, which hit it twice in one session. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**Both shapes, because they answer different failures.** The leak is prevented everywhere anything
can prevent it, and the one case macOS cannot prevent now arrives as a sentence instead of a
mystery.

**The leak was reproduced before it was fixed**, which is the part worth keeping. Start a bounded
run, signal the wrapper and its detached killer the way `pkill -f` does, and the emulator is
inherited by pid 1 and runs until somebody notices. `scripts/qemu-bounded-selftest.sh` is that
reproduction as an artifact. Run against the pre-226 script it fails three of its seven cases (both
orphan cases and the lock diagnostic); against the current one it passes all seven.

**What the killer does now.** It had one reason to fire, the bound, which bounds a run that is
allowed to finish and does nothing about a run whose wrapper is killed. It has three:

1. **the bound expired**, unchanged in effect;
2. **the wrapper is gone**, noticed by a `kill -0` poll once a second, which is what covers a
   SIGKILLed wrapper, a dead session and a closed terminal, none of which run a trap anywhere;
3. **the killer itself was signalled** (TERM or HUP), whose trap kills the child on the way out, so
   the one process that knows the child's pid never takes that knowledge with it.

**SIGINT is deliberately not in that trap list.** A shell puts an asynchronous subshell's SIGINT to
ignore before the subshell can trap it, so listing it would be a lie that reads as coverage. Ctrl-C
is covered better anyway: the wrapper dies of it, the killer survives it, and reason 2 fires within
a second.

**The early-reader property was verified rather than assumed**, since the block named it as a real
requirement. A real QEMU writing continuously into a pipe whose reader takes five lines and exits is
still killed at the bound. So is the milestone 38 property beside it: a fast child in a pipeline
returns at once rather than at the end of the bound, and it now does so because the killer's output
goes to `/dev/null` instead of into the pipe, which closes that bug at the root rather than at the
cleanup.

**And the macOS constraint was tested, not reasoned about.** `perl -e 'alarm 3; exec @ARGV'` against
the installed `qemu-system-aarch64` still leaves it running eight seconds later.

**The lock diagnostic.** On a failing exit, and only then, the wrapper runs `lsof` over the image
paths in its own command line and prints the pid, ppid, start time and command of anyone holding
one. It reports rather than kills, and says to walk the parent chain up first, because a QEMU whose
parent is a live harness is somebody's gate rather than a leak (AGENTS.md, 2026-08-15).

**In brief.** `scripts/qemu-bounded.sh` exists because `timeout(1)` does not exist on macOS and
`perl -e 'alarm N; exec @ARGV'` does not work on QEMU, which installs its own `SIGALRM` handler and
swallows the alarm. The script uses `SIGTERM`, which QEMU honours, and detaches its killer so it
survives a pipeline whose reader exits early.

**It does not survive its target detaching.** When the EL2 lane's run was killed, the emulator
survived with `ppid 1`. It then held the write lock on `nifefs-blank.img`, and **the next boot failed
with `Failed to get "write" lock`**, which names nothing about the real cause. The lane lost time to
it twice before recognising the shape.

## Why this is worth a block rather than a habit

AGENTS.md already narrates this failure from the other direction, at length: killing a loop script
does not kill its descendants, so a check honestly reporting "no qemu" is followed by a command that
finds one. Its advice is to ask who holds the file (`lsof target/nifefs.img`) rather than whether a
process matches a name, and to kill the tree at its root.

**That advice is rung four**, and this is the instance where rung four failed in the ordinary way: a
lane that had read the file still lost time, because the symptom arrives on a *later* run as a lock
error about a file, with nothing pointing at a leaked process.

Every lane uses this script. A leak here is not one lane's problem, it is the next lane's mysterious
failure, and this project runs many lanes.

## What it needs

**An emulator that cannot outlive the thing that started it**, or a failure that names the cause when
one does. Two shapes, and the block picks neither:

- **Make the leak impossible.** A process group killed as a group, or a supervisor that dies with its
  parent. Stronger, and it must not break the reason the killer is detached in the first place, which
  is a real requirement rather than an accident: a pipeline whose reader exits early must still get
  its emulator killed.
- **Make the symptom honest.** Whatever reports `Failed to get "write" lock` could say which process
  holds it, since `lsof` answers that in one call. Weaker, and it does not stop the leak, but it
  turns a mystery into a sentence.

**These are not exclusive and the second is worth having regardless**, because a lock can be held by
something this project did not start.

## BUGS

- **A SIGKILL to the killer defeats all of it, and nothing on macOS can fix that.** SIGKILL is not
  trappable and macOS has no `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG)`, so a supervisor shot in the head cannot hand
  off. `kill -9` at a whole process group is the realistic way to hit it. This is the case the lock
  diagnostic exists for, and the self-test deliberately does not assert on it: asserting on a known
  defect only pins it in place.
- **The parent-alive poll can be fooled by pid reuse.** If the wrapper dies abnormally and its pid is
  reused inside the bound, the killer waits out the full bound, which is exactly the old behaviour
  and never worse. It cannot fail the other way: a live wrapper's pid is not reused.
- **The lock diagnostic only inspects arguments that look like disk images** (`*.img`, `*.qcow2`,
  `*.raw`, and any `file=` field of a comma-separated option). A lock held on something named
  differently is not reported.
- **The self-test is in no gate**, so nothing runs it unless a person does. It starts real emulators
  and costs about a minute, which is a poor trade against every lane for a script that changes twice
  a year. That is rung two declined on purpose, and it is a foot gun: a later simplification of
  `qemu-bounded.sh` will not be caught by CI.
- **This block does not say how often it happens.** Two occurrences in one lane on one day is what
  prompted it, and nobody swept for others.
- **The macOS constraint that produced this script is unchanged, and was rechecked** rather than
  assumed: `perl`'s alarm is still swallowed by the installed QEMU.
- **It says nothing about the emulators a killed harness leaves**, which AGENTS.md records as a
  separate and larger failure: eleven QEMU processes over one day, the oldest with eight hours of CPU
  time on it.
