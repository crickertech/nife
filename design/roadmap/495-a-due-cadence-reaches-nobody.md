# 495. A cadence that says "due" reaches nobody, and the watcher cannot tell due from dead

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)* Promoted from the
proposal `a-due-cadence-reaches-nobody`, filed 2026-09-19, on calef's instruction of 2026-09-20 to
give every proposal on `main` a number. The text below is the proposal's own, unedited except for
this paragraph: the argument is its author's and promotion is not the moment to improve it. Written
by milestone 117 (the stranger test)'s run 6 lane, from what the run showed about the cadence that was supposed to have
started it.

**Gate: NONE.** A lane can start today. Every input is already on disk or one `gh` call away.

**In brief.** Two scheduled workflows exist to say "a person must now do something": the stranger
cadence (`script/stranger-test --due`) and the audit cadence (`script/audits`). Both say it by going
red in the Actions tab. **Nothing carries that red to a person.** `script/cadence-check`, which
`helpers/trunk-health.sh` runs so that scheduled failures stop being invisible, reports a workflow
only once it has gone fifteen days without a *success*, so a job that is correctly reporting "due"
and a job that is broken arrive as the same verdict, DEAD, a fortnight after the fact.

## The evidence

- **The stranger cadence was never tested.** Run 5 was 2026-08-18, so a run came due on
  2026-09-17. The workflow asks on Mondays: green on 2026-09-14 (27 days), and it could not go red
  before 2026-09-21. Run 6 happened on 2026-09-19 because a maintainer briefed a lane, which is the
  "somebody thought of it" this mechanism was built to replace.
- **The audit cadence shows what happens when one does go red.** On 2026-09-19 it had failed on
  every Monday since 2026-08-17, five in a row, and `script/cadence-check` lists it as
  `DEAD: never succeeded`, which is true and says the wrong thing: the job works, and what it has
  been saying for five weeks is "audits are due".

## What it would take, and the options

The question is what `due` should look like to the one watcher a person reads. Three shapes, each
priced by what it adds:

1. **Ask the scripts directly, not the workflows.** `trunk-health.sh` already runs on patagonia
   every ninety seconds with a checkout in hand; `script/stranger-test --due` and the audits'
   equivalent need no network, no `claude` and no toolchain. A `DUE:` line on transition, beside
   the existing `DEAD:` ones, closes the gap without touching GitHub. Recommended, because it
   reuses the watcher a maintainer session is already told to confirm is alive.
2. **Teach `cadence-check` a third verdict**, reading a job's own summary to tell "failed because
   something is due" from "failed". Keeps one source, but it parses step summaries, which is
   fragile, and still inherits the weekly lag.
3. **Open an issue from the workflow when it goes red.** Durable and visible, but it needs the
   workflow to hold `issues: write`, which every workflow here has declined on least-privilege
   grounds, and it is a second channel to the one the watcher already is.

**Reversible**: all three are tooling on one machine or one workflow, and nobody else has acted on
the current behaviour except by not acting.

## Scope note

This is not a stranger-test fix. The stranger cadence is one of two consumers, and fixing it only
there would leave the audit cadence red for a sixth week.

## Index row

Two scheduled workflows exist to say "a person must now do something": the stranger cadence
(`script/stranger-test --due`) and the audit cadence (`script/audits`).
