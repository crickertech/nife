# 258. Archive and compression: `tar` and zlib, because `git` cannot read its own objects without them

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Minted 2026-09-05 by calef, on finding that no milestone, proposal or line
of code in this tree covered archive or compression of any kind. *(Number provisional until the
merge queue lands it.)*

**Gate: DECISION.** For half of it. `tar` is nobody's call but a lane's and can start today. The
compressor's write-or-take question is [§146](../decisions/146-archive-and-compression-write-or-take.md),
which is `PROPOSED` and calef's, because taking a dependency is a decision under
[§46](../decisions/46-dependency-rule.md). **A lane may build the whole of part 1 and must stop at
part 2's fork rather than choosing it.**

## Why this exists, and it is not "a tree should have archive utilities"

**Milestone 99 (`git` on nife) counts a compressor it does not have.** Its own argument for why
`git` is a better first real workload than Vaultwarden:

> `init`, `add`, `commit`, `log`, `status`, `diff` are a filesystem, a hash, a compressor, a clock,
> and a place to put bytes. **Every one of those is something this tree either has or is building.**

Every git object is zlib-compressed, and so are packfiles, so `git` cannot read its own object
database without inflate. **The emphasised clause is false for the compressor**: there is no
compression code anywhere in this tree, in any form, and nothing is building any. Checked
2026-09-05 across `crates/`, `kernel/src/` and `user/src/`; the only greps that matched were a
comment about load inflating a median and `crates/gpt`'s note naming the zlib CRC-32 polynomial.

That matters beyond bookkeeping, because 99's whole case is that unlike Vaultwarden it needs nothing
that does not exist. One of its five things does not exist.

**Milestone 198 (the package manager) will need a container and probably a compressor**, and says
outright that it *"does not decide the format, the activation shape, or the repository split."*
AGENTS.md makes 198 a precondition on the ranking function itself, since no third party sees nife
before a package manager and a trivial install exist. So this sits underneath the thing that makes a
second customer possible, rather than beside it.

## Scope, and the refusals are part of the deliverable

**Part 1: `tar`, written here.** A `ustar` header is 512 bytes of fixed-offset fields with an octal
checksum and the format is a loop over headers. Pure logic, so it belongs in `crates/` where it is
host-testable and Kani-reachable, which is what AGENTS.md prescribes and what `gpt`, `elf`, `dtb`
and `nifefs` already are.

**The security-relevant decisions in `tar` are policy rather than specification**, and they are the
reason this is not a dependency: `../` traversal, absolute paths, and symlink escapes are questions
about what an extraction may reach. **In a capability system that answer should be structural**, and
this tree already has the shape for it in the `fs_subtree_caretaker` family. An extractor that
cannot name anything outside its subtree does not need to check for `..` at all, and demonstrating
that is worth more than the parser.

**Part 2: zlib inflate, and enough deflate for `git`.** Gated on §146. That section recommends
writing inflate and emitting only **stored (uncompressed) blocks** for the compressing direction,
which is legal zlib that any conforming reader accepts, and which makes real compression a measured
optimisation later rather than a prerequisite now. It also states the case for taking `miniz_oxide`
instead, and neither is chosen here.

**Refused, in writing, so nobody re-derives it:** `bzip2` (no consumer, displaced everywhere that
had a choice), `xz`/LZMA (no consumer, and §146 records the 2024 xz-utils backdoor as a cost that
belongs in a dependency decision), and `7z` (no consumer, inherits the LZMA argument).

**Deferred against a consumer:** `zstd` (take it if 198 picks it; FSE and ANS entropy coding is a
genuine subsystem this project would gain nothing from owning) and `zip` (a container plus DEFLATE
plus CRC-32, and this tree already has the CRC-32, so it is close to free once inflate exists).

## The part that is more interesting than plumbing

**A decompressor over untrusted input is the best adversarial parser this tree could acquire.**
Milestone 191 found that no Kani harness here had ever caught a defect after the day it was written,
and milestone 193 fixed the reachability that caused it. A real attacker-facing parser is what that
machinery is for, and the properties are stateable: *the output never exceeds the declared bound*,
*the window is never read outside itself*, *a truncated stream terminates rather than looping*.

**It is also the shape [§145](../decisions/145-compartmentalization-at-process-cost.md) proposes as
a possible bounded customer**: hand a confined domain untrusted bytes, let it reach nothing, take the
output. Risk 7's adversarial half is unbuilt, and a decompression bomb is an adversary that needs no
outside researcher to supply it.

## The proof that this milestone worked

**`tar` round-trips an archive this tree produced, extracted by a program that could not escape its
subtree if the archive told it to**, with the traversal case tested rather than argued. That is part
1 and it does not wait on §146.

For part 2, when it is unblocked: **an object written by real `git` is inflated correctly here**, on
a fixture rather than on a running `git`, since milestone 99 is `NOT-STARTED`.

## BUGS

- **Nobody has read git's object reader** to confirm that stored-block deflate is accepted in
  practice rather than only by the zlib specification. §146 carries the same caveat and it is the
  cheapest thing to check before part 2 starts.
- **This block does not price part 2.** §146 judges inflate to be small from the shape of RFC 1951
  and not from a line count, and it says so in its own BUGS.
- **The capability answer to path traversal is asserted, not built.** `fs_subtree_caretaker` exists
  and nothing has yet used it to confine an extractor, so "structural rather than checked" is a
  design intent in this block rather than a demonstrated property.
- **Compression is not on the customer path, because there is not one.** It is on the path to
  milestone 198, which is what makes a customer path possible, and that is a longer chain than the
  ranking function usually rewards. Saying so plainly is what keeps this from looking like a
  utilities shopping list.
