# 284. The first process is called `progenitor`, and 775 sentences still said `init`

**Status: BUILT** 2026-09-13. Minted the same day by the maintainer out of a measurement taken
against `main`: milestone 266 wrote down the policy for this and carried out three cases of it.
*(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

## Why this exists: a clause of milestone 266's own policy, not carried out

[Milestone 266](266-init-is-an-action-and-the-thing-is-a-process.md) renamed the first process from
`init` to `progenitor` (ratified by calef on 2026-09-08) and published the rule it applied, four
bullets, of which the second is:

> **A present-tense claim about the system changes**, because it is now false.

It applied that to **three** claims, all in `notes/`, out of 748 occurrences of the role it had
counted. A measurement on 2026-09-13 found the rest: hundreds of live sentences saying that `init`
holds the budget, endows the clock, builds the shell and refuses an unmeasured program, in module
headers, doc comments and notes, about a process that has not been called `init` for five days.

**That is a defect rather than a naming decision, which is why a lane may take it.** Correcting a
sentence that is false is not the same act as choosing what a thing is called; 266's own policy
already classifies it, and the name it corrects to was ratified.

## The measurement

Whole-word `init`, everywhere a developer lane may edit (the tree less `design/roadmap/` and
`design/decisions/`), on base commit `2bc68bd0` and after:

| | count |
|---|---|
| occurrences before | **1,751** |
| changed by this milestone | **775**, across 98 files |
| occurrences after | **976** |

**What the 976 are**, classified by reading rather than by pattern:

| what | count | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| the **verb**: `fn init`, `mmu::init`, `timer::init`, rustdoc links to them | ~387 | correct, untouched |
| records, quotations, captured transcripts, dated bench journals | ~347 | correct, untouched |
| `fixtures/src/hello.rs`'s five role constants and the prose bound to them | ~103 | **calef's**, proposed below |
| paths and filenames (`notes/trusted-init.md`, `target/init-measure-<arch>.txt`) | ~52 | untouched |
| covered by a blanket note another milestone already wrote | ~82 | untouched |

And, outside a lane's reach: **360 in other milestones' roadmap blocks** across 75 files, **92 in
`design/decisions/`** across 31 files, and **40 in `design/init-and-granular-spawn.md`**, which is
under `design/` and so is not a lane's either.

## The rule applied, so it can be disagreed with

266's four bullets, plus the two this sweep needed and 266 did not:

- **A present-tense claim about the system changes.** The whole subject. `crates/measured_boot`'s
  *"the hash the kernel checks init against"*, `crates/grant_plan`'s *"the name init loads it by"*,
  `SECURITY.md`'s *"a compromised init cannot break the kernel"*: all false, all fixed.
- **A record of what was true on a date does not change.** Milestone 22's title is *trusted init*,
  so `notes/trusted-init.md` keeps its name and its H1 keeps that phrase. `notes/visionfive2.md` is
  a dated first-silicon bench journal and was left whole. `notes/stranger-test.md` records what a
  stranger found on a given day, including *"the two archives boot different binaries under the name
  `init`"*, which was true when they found it.
- **A quotation never moves**, and where the thing quoted has since changed, a note goes beside it.
  Three cases: `components/src/builder.rs`'s self-description (quoted in two name-provenance blocks
  and in `script/names`' own header, now dated with *"then"*), the panic message `no building budget
  for init` (quoted in `notes/progenitor-and-loading.md` with a date, and in
  `kernel/src/user/disk_service.rs` with one already), and the serial line `init : measured, built,
  started` in `kernel/src/sched.rs`.
- **A file a developer may not edit does not change.** Counted above, not touched.
- **An identifier does not change, because a name is calef's.** New here, and it is the line that
  decides most of what was left. Every `INIT_*` constant, `fn init` in a doctest, `init_bytes`,
  `INIT_STACK_PAGES` and the five `hello` roles stayed exactly as they are. Where the prose around
  one had to stop lying, it says what the thing is and leaves the identifier alone.
- **A string a gate or a log parser matches does not change on its own.** New here, and it cost a
  real decision. `crates/board_console` recognises the boot-tour label `init/build  :` by substring,
  against **captured VisionFive 2 logs** that are evidence and cannot be re-written; so the label
  stays and the sentence after it was corrected. Runtime strings nothing parses (the `expect`s in
  `kernel/src/user.rs`, `could not spawn (init is out of memory)`, the handoff line) were changed,
  each checked against the tree first.

## What changed, by shape

- **Kernel and component documentation**, which is the bulk: `kernel/src/user.rs` (90),
  `crates/system_initializer/src/lib.rs` (80), `components/src/swish.rs` (48),
  `crates/grant_plan/src/spawnproto.rs` (32), `crates/grant_plan/src/lib.rs` (29),
  `kernel/src/trust.rs` (23), and forty more files with fewer.
- **Four user-visible strings.** `could not spawn (the progenitor is out of memory)` at the prompt
  (both copies, `components/src/swish.rs` and `crates/swish/src/lib.rs`), `nife: handing the system
  to the userspace progenitor.`, the `caps` table's spawn row, and the measured-boot refusal lines in
  `kernel/src/trust.rs`.
- **Three stale claims that were wrong about more than the name.**
  `components/src/builder.rs` said *"the kernel loads this program from the initrd's `init` entry"*
  and *"its archive entry is `init`, the one deliberate exception"*; both stopped being true when 266
  packed it as `builder`. `xtask/src/main.rs` said `hello` is *"packed as `init`"*. And
  `kernel/src/user.rs` cited `user/src/system_initializer.rs`, a path milestone 175 moved.
- **Two present-tense descriptions of a fixed bug**, in `kernel/src/user/sink_tests.rs`, moved to the
  past tense they were always describing: *"there `init` **is** the hello binary"* is no longer true
  and was never meant to outlive the fix it explains.
- **One section left whole with a note added above it.** `notes/pipes.md`'s *"A correction: there are
  two inits"* is the correction it records, so it stays; a dated parenthetical now says 266 made it
  one, because a reader arriving at that heading would otherwise leave believing there are two.
- **`crates/system_initializer`'s `Name:` block gained calef's refusal**, which is the other half of
  this work and the reason the crate is out of scope. See below.

## `system_initializer` keeps its name, and the refusal now lives beside the name

calef, 2026-09-13, asked directly whether the crate should follow the program: *"init is the issue
not initializer."*

The argument is one asymmetry. `init` lost because it is a truncated **verb** where the rule asks for
a noun. `initializer` is an **agent noun**, the thing that initialises, which is what the rule asks
*for*: 266's own house-style list cites it beside `builder`, `spawner`, `supervisor` and
`provisioner` as evidence for the convention. And the crate is not the process; it is the
initialisation, and it descends nothing, so `progenitor` fits it worse than it fits the program.

That is now a paragraph in `crates/system_initializer/src/lib.rs`'s existing `Name:` block, where
the next person to wonder will be reading, rather than only in a roadmap block. The full record is
milestone 266's `## Follow-on`, which the maintainer is handling; this lane did not touch it.

## `fixtures/src/hello.rs` still has five `init` roles, and they are calef's

Milestone 266's title is *"`init` stops being a role."* It is still a role here, five times, and this
lane investigated rather than assumed.

**What they are.** `INIT = 20`, `INIT_DEV = 23`, `INIT_CONSOLE = 24`, `INIT_IRQ = 25`,
`INIT_LEAST_AUTHORITY_DEMO = 28` and `INIT_COREMARK = 29` are **six**, not five, and none of them is
the first process. They are milestone 19d/19e test roles in which the `hello` catalogue plays the
**parent**: at each one it parses an ELF out of the initrd, builds a child from its own budget, and
reports. `INIT_BOOT_ROLE` (27) was the one that meant "boot the system", and that is the one 266
moved out; what is left is the demonstration that a userspace process can load another.

**Who dispatches them.** `kernel/src/user/tests.rs`, six `#[test_case]`s, each with its **own**
duplicate constant (`INIT_IRQ_ROLE = 25`, `INIT_ROLE = 20`, and so on) passed to `spawn_progenitor`.
`kernel/src/bench.rs` and `kernel/src/main.rs` reach `hello` through `HELLO_ENTRY` for other roles.
So they are live, driven from the kernel's own suite, and not dead wiring.

**The recommendation, which is not `progenitor`.** These roles are not the progenitor, and renaming
them to it would replace one false name with another. What they have in common is that the binary is
the **parent** in each: `PARENT`, `PARENT_DEV`, `PARENT_CONSOLE`, `PARENT_IRQ`,
`PARENT_LEAST_AUTHORITY_DEMO`, `PARENT_COREMARK`, with `fn parent`, `fn parent_dev` and so on.

Refusals, because they are the valuable half:

- **`PROGENITOR_*`** is refused: false. The progenitor is one process on one archive entry, and
  `hello` at role 20 is neither.
- **`LOADER_*`** is refused: it names one of the three things the role does (parse, build, endow) and
  the roles that delegate a UART or an interrupt are not loading anything interesting.
- **`BUILDER_*`** is refused: `builder` is already a program in this tree with its own argument, and
  a role constant that shares that name would make two things claim one word, which is the exact
  refusal that cost `system_builder` its crate twice.
- **Leaving them** is a live option and costs nothing mechanical. What it costs is that milestone
  266's title is not true of this file, and a newcomer reading `INIT => init(dma_phys)` beside
  `PROGENITOR_ENTRY` has two words for one idea and no way to tell they are different ideas.

**Not performed.** A role constant is a name; names are calef's; and `AGENTS.md`'s latitude for
recommending on reversible forks does not reach a name. The prose around them was left matching them,
deliberately, so that a rename moves one set of words and not two.

## BUGS

- **The `init/build  :` boot-tour label is still wrong and is left that way on purpose.**
  `crates/board_console::progress` matches it by substring and its captured VisionFive 2 fixture logs
  contain it; changing the label means changing the recogniser and stranding evidence that cannot be
  re-captured without the board. The sentence after the label was corrected, so the transcript now
  reads `init/build  : the userspace builder loaded ...`, which is honest and mismatched.
- **`design/init-and-granular-spawn.md` is cited from nine places and is 40 occurrences of the old
  name**, including its filename. It is under `design/`, which a lane may not edit.
- **471 occurrences remain in roadmap blocks and decisions**, 360 and 92 respectively plus the design
  file, unchanged since 266 recorded the same limitation. The most misleading are named in the
  hand-off below.
- **Three quotations are now dated rather than live**, which is the rule working and is still a cost:
  a reader who greps `no building budget for init` or `a minimal init: the system builder` finds the
  note and not the code. Each says so where it sits.
- **The captured transcripts in `notes/trusted-init.md` still read `init:`**, unchanged from 266's
  own `BUGS`, and so do the fenced diagrams in `notes/pipes.md`, whose column alignment is the
  meaning.
- **This was not gated by a boot.** `script/test` and `cargo build` were run; `script/swish-check`
  needs a QEMU this container does not have, and CI is what runs it. The change is comments and
  strings, and the four strings that a person sees were each checked against every consumer in the
  tree first, but the honest statement is that no interactive boot ran here.
- **The sweep is a judgement per occurrence and 976 were left.** The classification above was made by
  reading, and a reading is wrong some of the time. The tell for a miss is a sentence in the present
  tense with `init` as its subject.

## Follow-on

- **Recorded.** The `init/build  :` label, the `design/` occurrences and the dated quotations are
  limitations beside the features they belong to: `crates/board_console/src/progress.rs` for the
  label, and this block's `BUGS` for the rest.
- **Recorded.** The 471 occurrences in `design/roadmap/` and `design/decisions/` are this block's
  own `BUGS` entry beside the count, in `design/roadmap/284-finish-the-progenitor-rename.md`, because
  a lane may not edit either directory. They are a maintainer's sweep and were re-counted rather than inherited: 360 across 75 roadmap files, 92
  across 31 decisions, on 2026-09-13. The three that mislead most, because they read as live claims
  rather than as history: `design/decisions/14-project-direction.md` (*"init is the privileged
  unverified component"*, in the thesis `SECURITY.md` points at), `design/decisions/26-fault-endpoint.md`
  (26 occurrences, the measured-boot record, *"this kernel image runs exactly this init"*), and
  `design/decisions/55-shell-holds-the-redirect.md` (*"the `fs_subtree_caretaker` init would build per
  invocation"*). `design/init-and-granular-spawn.md` is a fourth of a different kind: 40 occurrences
  and the old name in its own filename, cited from nine places.
- **Milestone 399.** The six role constants above, their functions, and the
  `kernel/src/user/tests.rs` duplicates, with `PARENT_*` recommended and three alternatives refused.
  Held out of this milestone because a name is calef's. Numbered on 2026-09-19 by milestone 433's
  drain of the pile and `SUPERSEDED` in the same act by milestone 405, which turns these six
  parents into programs with their own names; 399 keeps the refusals and 405 carries them forward.

## Index row

**Built:** 2026-09-13

Minted 2026-09-13 by the maintainer from a measurement against `main`. Milestone 266 renamed the
first process and published the rule that a present-tense claim about the system changes because
it is now false; it applied that to three claims out of the 748 it counted. 1,751 whole-word `init` remained where a lane may edit, hundreds of them live sentences about a process that has
not been called that since 2026-09-08. 775 changed across 98 files, 976 left and each class named:
the verb `fn init` (correct and untouched), records, quotations, captured transcripts, `fixtures/src/hello.rs`'s six role constants (calef's, proposed with `PARENT_*` recommended and
four refusals) and 471 in files a lane may not edit. Three claims were wrong about more than the
name. calef's refusal of a `system_initializer` rename now sits in that crate's own `Name:` block.
