# 569. The disk an installer names has no model, only a size

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** The number is **provisional**: the integrator mints it at merge. Promoted from the proposal `the-disk-an-installer-names-has-no-model` on 2026-09-22, filed 2026-09-21. Raised by the rung 2a lane of milestone 198 (a package manager, and
the trivial install that makes a second customer possible) while building the install offer, and
filed rather than built because the half that a *program* needs is a wire shape and that is not a
lane's to mint.

**Gate: DECISION.** Only for the second half. The kernel-side half below needs no ruling and could
start today; what waits on calef is whether a process that is not the kernel may be told a
controller's identity, which is the same question milestone 421 (the block roster cannot name an
NVMe disk) is already held on.

## The sentence this is about

`kernel/src/user/install_service.rs` prints this before it wipes a disk:

```text
  install     :   TARGET: the NVMe disk attached to this machine, 1073741824 bytes.
  install     :   EVERYTHING ON THAT DISK WILL BE DESTROYED.
```

**That is the single most load-bearing sentence a stranger reads in this system.** Everything else
the installer does is recoverable by reinstalling; this one is not, and the whole safety property of
the install is that a person read it and agreed. Milestone 515 (a stick that puts itself on the
machine's disk)'s own `BUGS` says the confirmation *"must name the disk by model and size, not by an
ordinal"*, and today it names the size and hedges the rest: **"the NVMe disk attached to this
machine"**, because on a machine with two it could not say which.

## Why it says that and not more

Not for want of the data. NVMe's `IDENTIFY` with `CNS = 1` returns the controller structure, whose
first sixty bytes are ASCII: a 20-byte serial number, a 40-byte model number, and an 8-byte firmware
revision. `crates/non_volatile_memory_express` already declares `CNS_CONTROLLER` and **nothing in
this tree has ever issued that command**: the one `Command::identify` call site
(`kernel/src/non_volatile_memory_express.rs`) asks for `CNS_NAMESPACE`, because geometry is all the
driver needed.

The limit that is real, and worth stating precisely because it is easy to overclaim, is on the
**data plane**. `non_volatile_memory_express::Handoff` is what the admin plane tells the confined
server at spawn, and its own header says why it is shaped as it is: *"Three `u64`s because a spawn
carries three scalars"*, which is `kernel/src/user.rs`'s `Spawn`. All three are spent:

| word | carries |
|---|---|
| 0 | `dstrd`, `blocks_per` and `entries`, packed |
| 1 | `data_plane_phys` |
| 2 | `size_bytes` |

Forty ASCII bytes do not fit in a spawn, so **a program cannot be told the model the way it is told
the geometry.** That is the sentence the rung 2a lane wrote down, and it is true; what it does not
say is that the kernel does not need the spawn at all.

## Two halves, and only one of them is an architect's

**A. The kernel prints the model. Reversible, needs no ruling, and is the whole of the sentence
above.** The offer is printed by `install_service`, in the kernel, which is also where the admin
plane lives. A second `IDENTIFY` into the DMA region the admin queue already owns, a `[u8; 40]` on
the kernel-side `Wiring` (a Rust struct, not a wire), and the sentence names the drive. Cost: one
more admin command at bring-up, roughly thirty lines, and a parser for a fixed-offset ASCII field
that is space-padded rather than NUL-terminated.

**It also does not solve the two-disk case**, and saying so is the point. Naming *a* model is not
naming *which*, and a machine with two NVMe controllers needs an identity a person can match against
the thing in their hand. A serial number is that; a model number on its own is not.

**B. A program names the disk. This is the wire question and it is an architect's.** `disk_surveyor`
is what would list the machine's drives for a person to choose between, and it cannot see an NVMe
controller at all: `crates/block_roster` encodes two transport kinds and neither is NVMe. That is
milestone 421 (the block roster cannot name an NVMe disk) exactly, held since 2026-09-19 on
DECISIONS §193 (NVMe in the block roster), whose open question is the transport kind's spelling
**and whether an NVMe entry carries anything a virtio one does not**. A controller identity is that
"anything". So this proposal does not add a fork; it adds a consumer to one already open, and the
consumer is the sentence at the top of this file.

## What it would settle

Whether a stranger who is about to lose a disk is told which disk. Today the answer is "the one in
this machine", which is true on xenon and on every machine this has been run on, and is a guess on
the first machine with two.

## BUGS

- **This proposal does not price option B**, because its cost is whatever §193 rules the roster entry
  to be, and a price written before that ruling would be a price for a shape nobody has chosen.
- **A model number is not an identity.** Two identical drives in one machine report the same model,
  and the serial is what separates them. Option A as written would print the model and could print
  the serial as easily; what it cannot do is let a person *choose*, which is option B.
- **Nothing here helps a SATA disk**, which has no driver at all (milestone 515's `BUGS`), or an
  NVMe controller hidden behind Intel RST or VMD.

## Index row

The installer prints one sentence before it destroys a disk, and it is the most load-bearing sentence a stranger reads in this system: everything else the install does is recoverable by reinstalling. Today it names a size and hedges the rest, calling the target "the NVMe disk attached to this machine", because on a machine with two it could not say which. Milestone 515's own `BUGS` already says the confirmation must name the disk by model and size rather than by an ordinal, and whether a process that is not the kernel may be told a controller's identity is the half that waits on a ruling.
