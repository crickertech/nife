# 409. One machine description, not a description and a narrative saying the same thing

Promoted from the proposal `one-machine-description-not-two`, filed
2026-09-14 by milestone 268's lane, which caused it: the machine description now prints on all three
architectures, and on two of them the arm above it had already said most of the same things in its
own words. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

It reads the tree and moves lines within one function.

**Premise re-checked 2026-09-19 and still true.** `kernel/src/main.rs` calls
`arch::isa::print_summary()` in both the x86_64 and riscv64 arms and again inside
`print_machine_description`, which still carries its `#[cfg(not(any(test, feature = "bench")))]`, so
the duplication and the reason it cannot simply be deleted both stand as written.

## In brief

`kernel/src/main.rs`'s riscv64 and `x86_64` arms narrate their own bring-up, one line per step as
each piece comes up: `isa`, `firmware`, `memory`, `paging`, `pci`, `apic`, `clocks`, `io apic`. Then
`print_machine_description` answers the eight questions in one block, and several of the answers are
the same facts in a different layout. A riscv64 boot prints its `isa` and `firmware` lines twice.

The duplication is noise rather than a defect, and it is the honest cost of getting parity first:
the description had to land on all three before anything could be trimmed from either.

## What makes this less trivial than it looks

**The arms' lines serve an audience the description does not reach.** A `test` boot exits through
semihosting and a `bench` boot diverges into `bench::run`, and `print_machine_description` is
`#[cfg(not(any(test, feature = "bench")))]` precisely because neither is a boot anybody reads to
bring up a board. The riscv64 arm's `isa::print_summary` call carries a comment saying it is placed
where it is *"so that the test, shell and bench boots report it too"*. Delete it and those two
configurations stop saying what machine they ran on, which is a real loss on a bench.

**And the timing differs, which is sometimes the point.** The arms print each fact *at the moment
that piece comes up*, so a boot that dies halfway leaves a transcript that says how far it got. The
description prints everything at once, after everything is up, so a boot that dies before it prints
nothing at all. On a board those are different instruments, and milestone 267's lint exists because
somebody once moved a line between them.

## Roughly what to do

Decide, per duplicated line, which instrument it belongs to, and say so where it sits:

- facts a dying boot needs *early* stay in the arm;
- facts a healthy boot needs *collected* move to the description;
- facts a `test` or `bench` boot needs get a third home, or the description's `cfg` gets revisited
  (milestone 267's lint guards its **body**, not its signature, so that is a decision rather than a
  prohibition).

Measured, not guessed: a boot transcript per architecture before and after, in the block.

## Not a levelling-down

Nothing here removes a capability. The question is only whether one fact is printed once or twice,
and the default answer where it is unclear should be twice: a duplicated line costs a reader a
second, and a missing one costs a bench session.

## Index row

`kernel/src/main.rs`'s riscv64 and x86_64 arms narrate their own bring-up a line at a time, and
`print_machine_description` then answers the same eight questions in one block, so a riscv64 boot
prints its `isa` and `firmware` lines twice. The duplication is the honest cost of getting the
description onto all three architectures first, and it is not simply deletable: the arms print each
fact at the moment that piece comes up, so a boot that dies halfway still says how far it got, and
they are what a `test` or `bench` boot reports at all, since the description is excluded from both.
The work is to decide, per duplicated line, which of the two instruments it belongs to, say so where
it sits, and show a boot transcript per architecture before and after.
