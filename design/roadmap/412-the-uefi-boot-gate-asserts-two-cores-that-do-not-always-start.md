# 412. `script/test`'s UEFI leg asserts two cores online, and the second one does not always start

Promoted from the proposal
`the-uefi-boot-gate-asserts-two-cores-that-do-not-always-start`, filed 2026-09-14 by milestone 294's
lane. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

Nothing is owed and nothing is missing. It is a measurement and a decision about a
gate's assertion, both of which a lane can do today.

**Premise re-checked 2026-09-19 and still true, with evidence that arrived after it was filed.**
`xtask/src/main.rs` still sets `NIFE_SMP=2` for the UEFI tour and still asserts
`smp: 2 core(s) online` unconditionally, and `ap_boot.rs`'s "third or later" bound is untouched:
milestone 316 fixed that module's `BUGS` #3 (`boot_cpu_id` answering the wrong question) and left #1
open. **316 also supplies a second sample this block should reconcile rather than ignore**: 26
two-core boots, eight of them under OVMF, with zero `cpu 1 did not start` lines. 316's own `BUGS`
says that is incidental evidence about a different failure mode and not the dedicated
`cargo xtask uefi-boot` measurement step 1 asks for, which is why this stays work rather than
becoming an answer.

**Found by milestone 294's lane, which had no business being anywhere near it.** That lane changed
markdown, `script/roadmap` and one comment in `script/lint`, and nothing `cargo xtask` builds. Its
first `script/test` failed:

```
  smp: init-sipi-sipi via the local apic, trampoline at 0x8000
  smp: cpu 1 did not start (firmware returned -1)
  smp: 1 core(s) online
  ...
uefi-boot: the boot transcript is missing "smp: 2 core(s) online"
```

The next two runs passed, on the same tree, same machine, same commit: **one failure in three.**

## Why this is not already the recorded bug

`kernel/src/arch/x86_64/ap_boot.rs`'s module BUGS section records exactly this class and bounds it
away from here: *"A third or later secondary, brought up while an earlier one is already online and
running, fails intermittently and non-deterministically ... At `-smp 3` and above, exactly one
secondary typically fails."* `xtask/src/main.rs` sets `NIFE_SMP=2` for the UEFI tour, and the
comment beside it reasons from the same bound: *"The suite below stays at one core, because the
two-core AP defect this tour does not touch."*

So the record says the flake starts at three cores and the gate was written believing it. **It
reaches two.** Either the bound in `ap_boot.rs` is wrong, or this is a second failure mode that
happens to print the same line, and the difference matters: the recorded one is a secondary
brought up *beside an already-running one*, which cannot be what happened at `-smp 2`.

## What this costs today

`uefi-boot` asserts `smp: 2 core(s) online` unconditionally, so the gate fails on a defect the tree
has already recorded as intermittent and not root-caused. A lane that hits it reads a red gate it
did not cause, and the cheapest available conclusion is that the flake is somebody else's problem
and the run should be repeated, which is how a gate stops being read.

Note that **no pull request check catches this**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs every job on
`ubuntu-24.04-arm`, and nothing there boots the x86_64 UEFI image. It is only ever seen by a lane
running `script/test` on an x86_64 host.

## What a lane should do

1. **Measure it.** Boot `cargo xtask uefi-boot` enough times to put a rate on it at `-smp 2`, which
   one lane's three runs cannot. One in three is a sample, not a number.
2. **Decide which record is wrong**, and correct that one: either `ap_boot.rs`'s "third or later"
   bound, or `xtask/src/main.rs`'s comment that the tour does not touch the two-core defect.
3. **Then decide what the gate should assert**, which is the part worth arguing rather than
   assuming. Asserting two cores is what makes the assertion worth having (it proves the
   trampoline page the loader asked for was usable, which is what its own comment says). Retrying
   the boot, or asserting one core, both weaken it. A gate that fails one time in three is worse
   than either, and a gate that is *known* to fail one time in three and stays that way is worst.

## Index row

`cargo xtask uefi-boot` asserts `smp: 2 core(s) online` unconditionally, and milestone 294's lane
saw `smp: cpu 1 did not start (firmware returned -1)` once in three runs on one tree, one machine
and one commit. `arch::x86_64::ap_boot`'s `BUGS` bounds that flake at three cores and above, and the
comment beside `NIFE_SMP=2` reasons from the same bound, so either the bound is wrong or this is a
second failure mode that prints the same line; the recorded one is a secondary brought up beside an
already-running one, which cannot be what happens at two. Nothing in CI boots the x86_64 UEFI image,
so only a lane running `script/test` on an x86_64 host ever meets it. The work is a rate first, then
which record to correct, then what the gate should assert, and that last part is the one worth
arguing: a gate known to fail one run in three and left that way is worse than either alternative.
