# 292. `fixtures/src/sink.rs` is three programs wearing one name

**Status: BUILT** 2026-09-14. calef ruled the split; the three names are **provisional** and gathered
below for him to rule together. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

One binary dispatched three roles on `arg0` (`ROLE_WRITER`, `ROLE_FILE`, `ROLE_VERIFY`) and was
packed into both archives as `sink`. It is three programs now, and all three stay in `fixtures/`:

| was | is (provisional) | where | why there |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ROLE_WRITER` | **`sink_transcript_writer`** | `fixtures/` | writes a pinned transcript so a test can assert a classification by value |
| `ROLE_FILE` | **`file_sink`** | `fixtures/` | exercises the contract's receiving end against a real image; `>` at a prompt is `fs_file_caretaker` |
| `ROLE_VERIFY` | **`file_source`** | `fixtures/` | reads the file back so `<` and `|` can be compared |

This is the third application of calef's 2026-09-14 ruling, in his own words: *"I don't understand
why we would want to write a program that does multiple things. Part of the beauty of Unix that I
think we want to retain is small programs with specific functions."* One concurrent lane is splitting
`components/src/ntp.rs` and another `fixtures/src/hello.rs`'s thirty-one roles, and he asked for this
case to have its own milestone rather than being folded into the second. **Neither of those lanes had
landed when this block was written**, so their milestone numbers are not cited here; the integrator
can wire them at merge, and this note is what says a pointer is missing rather than absent.

## The argument is not that three programs are tidier

**It is that a dispatch number nobody can get wrong is one that does not exist.**

The role numbers were **three hand-maintained copies of a fact two binaries had to agree on**, which
is what AGENTS.md rule 7 exists to prevent, and all three were invisible to `script/lint` check 5
because none of them was a `#[path]` module:

| file | what it declared |
|---|---|
| `fixtures/src/sink.rs:86-88` | `ROLE_WRITER = 0`, `ROLE_FILE = 1`, `ROLE_VERIFY = 2` |
| `kernel/src/user/sink_tests.rs:9` | `ROLE_WRITER = 0` |
| `kernel/src/user/fs_service.rs:1272-1273` | `SINK_ROLE_FILE = 1`, `SINK_ROLE_VERIFY = 2` |

**Three sites, six constant definitions, and the split deleted every one.** Counted by grepping the
values and not only the names, because a bare `arg0: 1` would not have shown up in a search for
`ROLE_`; there were none. (`components/src/disk_partitioner.rs` and
`fixtures/src/os_primitives_benchmarker.rs` have their own role numbers. They are different programs
with the same defect and are not this milestone's.)

`fs_service.rs`'s copy carried its own warning, which is the tell that the tree already knew this was
too low a rung:

> `fixtures/src/sink.rs`'s roles. Kept in sync with that file by name and by this comment; a
> mismatch spawns the wrong role and hangs, which is why they are named here rather than spelled as
> bare integers at the two call sites.

A comment asking the next person to remember is rung four of AGENTS.md's ladder. Three programs are
rung one: the wrong state is unrepresentable, because there is no number to get wrong. The failure it
guarded against was real and nasty (**a mismatch hangs rather than fails**, since the wrong role
blocks on a rendezvous nobody is serving), and a hang in a kernel test boot is diagnosed from a
timeout rather than from an assertion.

**A second duplicate went with them, unasked.** The single binary needed two report-slot constants,
`REPORT_WRITER = 1` and `REPORT_FS = 2`, because the writer role held no FS endpoint and so its
report sat one slot lower than the other two roles'. Each program now has one `REPORT`, at the slot
it actually uses.

## Where each one landed, and why all three stayed in `fixtures/`

Milestone 175 spent 363 files drawing the line between `components/` (what a distribution ships
because somebody wants its function) and `fixtures/` (what exists to exercise the system), so the
directory is part of the ruling rather than tidying afterwards.

**The brief said to check whether `ROLE_FILE` belongs in `components/`, on the grounds that
`kernel/src/user/fs_service.rs` spawns it "in the live path". That premise is false, and checking it
was the point of asking.** `fs_service.rs` carries its own answer at the module declaration in
`kernel/src/user.rs`:

> `#[cfg_attr(not(test), allow(dead_code))] // spawned only by the phase-2 test`

and both entry points are attributed the same way. `start_file_sink` and `start_file_source` are
called from exactly one file, `kernel/src/user/sink_tests.rs`, and from nowhere else in the tree.

The live `>` path is `components/src/fs_file_caretaker.rs`, which is a different program and a
different shape: it **narrows** `filesystem_proto` for a client that speaks `filesystem_proto`, where
`file_sink` **translates**, speaking the sink contract to its client and `filesystem_proto` to the FS
server. `file_sink` is the fixture that proves the translation works against a real RedoxFS image.
Nothing at a prompt builds one, which notes/pipes.md has recorded since milestone 50.

So: three fixtures, and the directory question is answered rather than assumed.

## The names, and what was refused

Each program's own header carries its provenance block and its refusals (`script/names`), which is
where a reader meets them. Gathered here because calef rules them together:

- **`sink_transcript_writer`** (was `ROLE_WRITER`). Refused `writer` (generic), `indifferent_writer`
  (names the property being proved rather than the program, which is `flaky`'s mistake applied to a
  conclusion), `sink_writer` (reads as "writes a sink" rather than "writes to one", and says nothing
  about what it writes).
- **`file_sink`** (was `ROLE_FILE`). It is the name the kernel side already spelled:
  `fs_service::FileSink`, `fs_service::start_file_sink`. Refused `file_sink_caretaker`, which nearly
  won on analogy with `terminal_sink_caretaker` (the same adapter for a different backend) and lost
  on collision with the existing and different `fs_file_caretaker`.
- **`file_source`** (was `ROLE_VERIFY`). `source` is this tree's own word for the reading end of the
  sink contract: `grant_plan::spawnproto::Wiring` carries `sink` and `source` as the two directions,
  and `sink_tests` already names the endpoint `source` at the call site. Refused `sink_verifier` and
  `verify` (they name the *test* this serves; the program verifies nothing, it reads a file and sends
  bytes), `file_reader` (generic), and `cat` (a standard term a reader knows from outside, and
  therefore one that would promise a name argument and a general program, which this is not).

**`sink` survives as the contract word**, under the structural-versus-current test calef set on
2026-09-13 (design/naming.md). `byte_sink_proto` is a wire contract named for what it carries and
makes no disposal claim; `file_sink`'s terminus is structural, because its client holds a capability
over which no message but *append* is expressible and no grant anybody could make would change that.
What did not survive the test is one binary wearing that word for three different jobs.
`byte_sink_proto` is untouched.

**One naming inconsistency this milestone found and did not settle, because it is an architect's.**
The tree spells one sink adapter `terminal_sink_caretaker` and this one `file_sink`, and `caretaker`
is defined in two incompatible ways depending on which file you read. The old `sink.rs` header said
`fs_file_caretaker` is a caretaker *because* it serves the protocol its client speaks, and that this
program was deliberately not one; `sink_tests` says the terminal adapter is "`fs_file_caretaker`'s
shape", and it is named `caretaker`. Both cannot be the definition. It is recorded in `file_sink`'s
own header, where the next person to touch the name is already reading.

## What the tests prove is unchanged, and what changed under them

`kernel::user::sink_tests` is four `#[test_case]`s and **not one assertion moved**. What changed is
which image each spawn names:

- `spawn_writer` takes `sink_transcript_writer` and passes `repeat` as `a0` rather than as `a1`
  behind a role number.
- `fs_service::start_file_sink` takes a `file_sink_image` and spawns it with `arg0: 0`.
- `fs_service::start_sink_verify` is `start_file_source`, takes a `file_source_image`, and spawns it
  with `arg0: 0`. **Renaming that function is a judgement call this lane made and flags**: leaving
  `start_sink_verify` pointing at a program called `file_source` is exactly the drift this milestone
  is about, and a `pub fn` inside one kernel module with one caller is the reversible end of the
  naming rule. It is provisional like the rest.

The three empty roles that `_start` used to dispatch are gone, and with them the `_ => writer(a1)`
default arm, which silently ran the writer for any unknown role number and would have turned a
mistyped role into a plausible-looking wrong answer rather than a failure.

## Three entries in the archive where there was one

The initrd tables in `xtask/src/main.rs` pack `sink_transcript_writer`, `file_sink` and
`file_source` on both ISAs, so the measured-boot manifest (`kernel/src/trust.rs`, the kernel's
`build.rs`) gains two lines. No name is near `nifefs`'s `NAME_LEN = 32`: the longest is
`sink_transcript_writer` at 22 bytes.

## Records this milestone deliberately did not edit

`design/roadmap/50-pipes-and-redirection.md` and `design/decisions/51-sink-protocol.md` both cite
`fixtures/src/sink.rs`, and both keep the old path. Milestone 50 is **BUILT**, which design/naming.md
makes an account of what happened under the names it happened under, and a decision records what was
decided in the words used then. A reader arriving from either lands here, because this block names
both. The live documents (notes/sink-protocol.md, notes/pipes.md, notes/shared-page-audit.md,
notes/unsafe-obligations.md, `crates/byte_sink_proto`, `components/src/swish.rs`) were repointed,
because a reader picks those up to act on.

`design/naming.md`'s 2026-09-13 table row for `sink` (the program) is a record of a ruling made when
the program had three roles, so the row stands and carries a note saying what the split did to its
reasoning. The ruling itself is unaffected: `sink` survived that sweep for reasons that survive the
split too.

## BUGS

- **The shared-frame duplication got one file wider rather than narrower.** `file_sink` and
  `file_source` each carry their own `PAGE_VA`, their own `MappedWindow`, and their own `put`/`get`,
  which is the same dozen lines every other FS client in the tree carries. The split did not create this and could
  not honestly avoid it: a crate for it is a naming and dependency decision, and the `ntp` split lane
  has already proposed exactly that crate. Recorded in both programs' `BUGS` sections rather than
  only here.
- **`file_sink` and `file_source` both open one hard-coded name**, `byte_sink_proto::fixture::SINK_NAME`.
  They are two halves of one fixture rather than general programs, and nothing takes a name from
  anywhere. Recorded in both headers.
- **`file_source` reports the size it found, not the size it delivered.** Every caller compares what
  it received, so this has never mattered; it is recorded where a future caller meets it.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 413.** `caretaker`
  carries two incompatible definitions in this tree, one that narrows a protocol and one that
  translates between two, and this lane had to name a translating adapter without being able to say
  which. It shipped as `file_sink` on a collision argument, which is a local answer to a global
  question.
- **Recorded.** The three limitations in this block's `BUGS` are written where a reader meets them:
  the shared-frame duplication and the single hard-coded name in both `fixtures/src/file_sink.rs`
  and `fixtures/src/file_source.rs`, and the reported-size caveat in `fixtures/src/file_source.rs`.
- **Done.** The shared-frame duplication has a home already: the concurrent `ntp` split lane has
  proposed the crate that would end it across every program that maps that frame, and this milestone
  added one more copy of a shape that proposal already covers rather than a new problem. The proposal
  is not cited by number because that lane had not landed when this was written.
- **Refused.** Lifting `put`, `get` and `fs_call` into a crate here, to avoid the two copies this
  split creates. It is the right fix and it is not this milestone's: a crate is a name and a
  dependency, it would touch six programs this lane has no business in, and doing it badly in a
  hurry is how a tree gets a shared module nobody can restructure later. The proposal that owns it
  already exists.

## Index row

**Built:** 2026-09-14

Minted 2026-09-14 by calef, the third application of his ruling that a program does one thing (concurrent lanes are splitting `ntp` and `hello`), and he asked for this case to have its own milestone. One binary picked `ROLE_WRITER`, `ROLE_FILE` or `ROLE_VERIFY` out of `arg0`. The argument for splitting is not tidiness: the role numbers were **three hand-maintained copies of a fact two binaries had to agree on** (the program, `kernel/src/user/sink_tests.rs`, `kernel/src/user/fs_service.rs`), six constant definitions in all, invisible to `script/lint` check 5 because none was a `#[path]` module, and a mismatch **hangs** rather than fails. Three programs deleted all six, and the writer's two report-slot constants with them. All three stay in `fixtures/`: the brief's premise that `fs_service` spawns the file role in the live path is false (`// spawned only by the phase-2 test`), and `>` at a prompt is `fs_file_caretaker`, which narrows a protocol where this one translates between two. Names `sink_transcript_writer`, `file_sink`, `file_source` are **provisional**, gathered in the block with their refusals; `byte_sink_proto` is untouched. Found and did not settle: `caretaker` is defined two incompatible ways across `fs_file_caretaker` and `terminal_sink_caretaker`.
