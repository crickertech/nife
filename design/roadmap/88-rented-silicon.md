# 88. nife on rented silicon: Oracle's free tier first, Graviton metal for the PMU

Raised 2026-08-03, from the observation that several open milestones are
hardware-gated and a cloud instance is hardware without a purchase. Oracle-first is calef's call
(2026-08-03): the always-free A1 shape (4 Ampere cores, 24 GB) makes the recurring cost zero, so
the rented-silicon story starts with no bill to watch.

Stage 2 onward needs an Oracle account, and stage 4 rents Graviton `.metal` by
the hour; both are calef's to provide. Stage 1 is not gated and is a lane on its own: boot under
UEFI locally with AAVMF firmware and get a byte out, which is also the boot stub milestone 24's EFI
path shares.

**What this buys that no machine on the desk can.** Every benchmark in this tree so far runs on
hardware the reader has to take our word about. A cloud instance is the same silicon for everyone:
"nife against Linux on the same free shape, here is the image, rerun it on your own free
account" is a credibility claim no desk machine can make, and it is the demonstrator thesis
(DECISIONS §14) applied to the *audience* rather than the code. Second, an always-free instance
can stay up, which opens a door no burst rental does: a public, always-on nife demo
instance, its own decision later because exposing this kernel to the internet is a security
posture question, not a deployment step. Third, milestone 25's deferred `sel4bench` needs a real
PMU, no VM exposes one, and Graviton `.metal` rents one by the hour; that stage stays AWS.

**Why Oracle is friendlier to this kernel than EC2, and the honest unknowns.** OCI's A1 VMs are
KVM guests with paravirtualized devices, and this tree already drives virtio-net and virtio-blk
over the PCIe transport (DECISIONS §18), so the existing drivers plausibly work where EC2 would
demand a new ENA driver on day one. "Plausibly" is load-bearing: whether A1's launch mode
presents virtio to a custom non-Linux image, which UART its serial console emulates, and whether
the custom-image import path (QCOW2) accepts an arbitrary UEFI payload are all facts to measure
on arrival, not assume. The known caveats, recorded so nobody rediscovers them: always-free A1
capacity is famously scarce in popular regions, Oracle reclaims idle always-free instances unless
the account is upgraded to pay-as-you-go (which keeps the free tier free but adds a card), and
the 4 OCPUs can be split across at most two instances.

**What it costs in engineering, named up front.** No cloud takes a kernel image; it takes a disk
image that boots via UEFI, so the kernel needs a boot path it does not have (an EFI stub or a
bootloader stage). Server aarch64 VMs describe the machine with **ACPI, not a device tree**,
which is a new discovery front door (milestone 60 built the DTB one). None of this is wasted
motion: the UEFI work is shared with optional milestone 24's EFI variant (corrected 2026-08-03;
an earlier draft said 24 "needs" it, but 24 also has a UEFI-free path via VZ's Linux boot
protocol, recorded in its file), and it is provider-neutral by construction, so Graviton, Azure
and Google's Ampere shapes become reachable with the same boot path. One cross-reference the
stages should honor: if stage 2 finds OCI's serial console is virtio-console rather than a
16550, the driver it forces is milestone 24's named artifact; build it once.

**The staging that keeps it honest**, each stage a deliverable on its own:

1. Boot under UEFI locally (QEMU `virt` with AAVMF firmware), serial byte out. No cloud yet.
2. The always-free A1 shape: custom image imported, a byte on the OCI serial console. This is the
   milestone's "printed a byte over serial" moment, at $0.
3. The bench suite against Linux on the identical free shape, published with the image, so the
   reader's rerun is also $0. This stage also owes milestone 17 its gate: the `smp_throughput`
   scaling curve across hart counts (finished at stage 4's 64-core metal) is the measurement that
   decides whether the SCHED lock ever gets partitioned (notes/sched-lock-inventory.md).
4. Graviton `.metal` by the hour, for the PMU: the `sel4bench` comparison milestone 25 deferred.
   The only paid stage, used in bursts.
5. Stretch, each its own decision later: virtio networking on the A1 instance with the drivers
   the tree already has, and the public demo instance question.

## Scope note

Nothing here retires the VisionFive 2 or the milestone 87 machine: aarch64 cloud has no IOMMU
control from inside a VM and no physical peripherals; it complements the boards, it does not
replace them. (RISC-V rental is milestone 89's subject, not this one's.) Nothing in this
milestone may regress the QEMU boot: DTB stays the first-class discovery path, ACPI is a second
front door beside it, gated by the same parity rule as everything else (§19).

## Index row

"Here is the image, rerun it on your own free account" is a credibility claim no desk machine can
make, at $0 recurring. OCI's A1 VMs are KVM with virtio, which this tree already drives; the PMU
stage stays Graviton `.metal` by the hour, unblocking milestone 25's deferred `sel4bench`. Costs a
UEFI boot path and an ACPI front door, both shared with optional milestone 24
