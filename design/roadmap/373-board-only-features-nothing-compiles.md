# 373. The board-only kernel features nothing compiles, until somebody is standing at the board

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Filed as a proposal on 2026-09-04 by the `maintainer/e3-on-radon` lane;
promoted by milestone 433 on 2026-09-19. **The premise was checked that day and half of it has
stopped being true, which narrows the work rather than closing it.** `script/lint`'s per-feature
clippy loop now builds `board`, `fastpath_pad` and `soak_test` on both aarch64 and riscv64, and a
second loop builds `shell`, `soak_test`, `job_mix` and `board` on x86_64, so the individual features
are no longer uncompiled. Two things are still exactly as this file describes them. **`single_hart`
and `reboot_soak_test` appear nowhere in `script/lint`**, so nothing but a person's own
`script/board-image` run has ever compiled either. And **no combination is built**: every one of the
six feature sets below is a combination, clippy builds each feature alone, and a `board,bench,single_hart`
card is a configuration nothing in CI has ever seen. Two feature names in the body are pre-297
spellings: `soak` is `soak_test` and `reboot_soak` is `reboot_soak_test`.

**Gate: NONE.** It is a build matrix, and the expensive question (which of these should also *run*
somewhere) is deliberately left out of it.

## In brief

`kernel/Cargo.toml` carries feature flags whose only consumer is a microSD card:
`board`, `soak`, `job_mix`, `reboot_soak`, `single_hart`, and `fastpath_pad` beside them. **Nothing
in CI compiles any of them.** `script/lint`, `script/test`, `script/bench` and every workflow build
the default and test kernels; a card build happens when a person runs `script/board-image`, which is
minutes before they walk to the bench.

So an ordinary refactor in `kernel/src/sched.rs` or `kernel/src/smp.rs` can break a card build, and
the tree stays green for as long as nobody writes a card. The failure surfaces as a bench session
that starts with a four-minute cargo error instead of a boot, which is the most expensive place in
this project to discover a compile error: the board is powered, the card is out, and the person is
not at their desk.

## What it would be

A CI job, or a leg of `script/ci-build`, that runs `cargo build -p kernel --release --target
riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf` once per feature set the tree actually writes to a card:

```
board
board,soak
board,soak,reboot_soak
board,job_mix
board,bench,single_hart
board,bench,single_hart,fastpath_pad
```

Six release builds of one crate. It proves compilation and nothing else, which is the point: it is
the cheap half, and it catches the failure that costs the most.

## What it is not

**It is not "run the soak in CI".** These features exist because their workloads need a board;
`reboot_soak` will not even compile off riscv64 by deliberate design, and a `job_mix` sweep under TCG
is the rehearsal `script/job-mix` already provides. Compiling is the part that generalizes.

**And it is not a fourth architecture's problem.** `fastpath_pad` has no x86_64 module and that is
already recorded in `script/fastpath-footprint`'s BUGS; a matrix would make the gap visible rather
than fix it.

## The same shape one level out

The list above is hardcoded, which is finding 11 of notes/architecture-list-sweep.md wearing new
clothes: the seventh card feature somebody adds is measured here only if they remember to type it.
Deriving it from `[features]` is possible and is a second decision, because not every feature in
that file belongs on a card.

## Where it came from

notes/footprint-perturbation.md's BUGS, and the observation that `single_hart` shipped into a tree where
nothing but a person's own `script/board-image` run has ever compiled it.

## Index row

`kernel/Cargo.toml` carries feature flags whose only consumer is a microSD card, and an ordinary
refactor in `kernel/src/sched.rs` or `kernel/src/smp.rs` can break a card build while the tree stays
green, because the failure surfaces as a four-minute cargo error at the start of a bench session,
which is the most expensive place in this project to find a compile error. `script/lint` has since
closed half of it by clippy-building most of these features individually; `single_hart` and
`reboot_soak_test` are compiled by nothing, and no combination a card actually uses is built at all.
Six release builds of one crate would cover the set. It proves compilation and nothing else, which
is the point: running a soak in CI is not the ask, since these workloads need a board and
`reboot_soak_test` will not compile off riscv64 by design. The list is hardcoded, which is finding
11 of notes/architecture-list-sweep.md in new clothes, and deriving it from `[features]` is a second
decision because not every feature belongs on a card.
