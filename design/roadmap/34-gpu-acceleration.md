# 34. GPU acceleration via virtio-gpu 3D (the display ladder's rung four)

**Status: NOT-STARTED.**

**Gate: NONE.** The block prices it as a mountain and says it reopens the parked competitor
question; that question is decided, not merely open. [DECISIONS
§131](../decisions/131-hold-at-rung-two.md) (calef, 2026-08-26): hold at the display ladder's rung
two until something useful is built and proven on text mode. This is not an unresolved fork
blocking a lane; it is a resolved one whose answer is "not yet, and not a lane's to pick up," and it
reopens on the terms §131 names rather than on a further decision here.

**In brief.** The **Venus** path: Vulkan commands serialized over the virtio-gpu device, arriving on the §18 PCIe transport, so the guest gets real GPU acceleration without owning a hardware driver. Needs the 3D context and command-submission side of virtio-gpu that rung one deliberately left alone (rung one sets up no cursor queue and no 3D context, keeping the §23 two-queue ceiling untouched), the confinement story extended to command-carried backing addresses (DECISIONS §30's residual gap: those are the addresses the descriptor validator structurally cannot see, and today only an IOMMU stops them), and something to consume it, which is what would give `wgpu` a real target

**Why it matters.** **how every VM gets a GPU without a hardware driver**, and the honest ceiling on the display ladder: rung five (a bare-metal driver for the VisionFive 2's BXE-4-32 3D core) is struck as a Linux-scale multi-year effort that proves nothing this does not. A mountain, priced as such, and it reopens the parked competitor question the ladder's governance note names as the architect's call
