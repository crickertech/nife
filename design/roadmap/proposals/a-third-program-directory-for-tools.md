# A third program directory, for the tools a person invokes

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-13.** Found by milestone 175's classification pass, which
[its own block](../175-user-components-fixtures-split.md) asked for in as many words: *"check
whether milestone 39's two-way split still fits the tree or whether a third directory (`tools/`, or
similar, not decided here) is honest about what's actually there, rather than forcing a fit."* This
is the answer to that question, written down instead of taken.

**Gate: DECISION.** A top-level directory holding a Cargo package is named exactly as the package,
so this is a name, and names are calef's. It is also the most expensive kind of name in this tree:
it lands in `xtask`, in four exclusion lists, in `script/lint`, `script/names` and `script/verify`,
and in every citation that points into it.

## What milestone 175 found

175 split 74 programs into `components/` (49) and `fixtures/` (23, plus two `#[path]` modules). The
rule it used was one question, *would a distribution ship this because somebody wants its function?*,
and it works: no program was genuinely hard to place under it.

**But sixteen of the forty-nine components are not services**, and 39's option A already listed
`tools/` beside `components/` for exactly them:

| | |
|---|---|
| `date`, `printenv`, `uptime`, `uuid` | read one thing, print it, exit |
| `ps`, `pgrep`, `pmap`, `watch` | look at the running system |
| `wc`, `rm`, `doc`, `rmle` | operate on what the command line designates |
| `disk_surveyor`, `disk_partitioner`, `identity_provisioner`, `swapper` | operator tools, run once on purpose |

**Ten of the sixteen are already typeable at the prompt**: `grant_plan::Prog::from_name` resolves
`date`, `rm`, `wc`, `doc`, `ps`, `pgrep`, `watch`, `uptime`, `printenv` and `uuid` and nothing else
in that list, which is the closest thing this tree has to a `/bin`.

The remaining thirty-three are what the word was coined for: long-running servers and drivers
(`net_stack`, `gpu_driver`, `clock`, `login`, `credentialer`, the caretakers), and the init and
supervision spine (`progenitor`, `root_supervisor`, `spawner`, `builder`, `job_undertaker`).

## Why 175 did not take it

**The two-way split is not a forced fit, and that is the honest case against a third directory.**
Milestone 39's vocabulary says a **component** is *the shippable unit, a binary plus its manifest*;
a service is what a component offers. `wc` is a shippable unit with a manifest. It offers no
service, and nothing in 39's definition requires it to. So `components/` holding `wc` is coarse
rather than wrong, and a coarse-but-correct directory is a much smaller defect than a name taken
without the person who owns names.

**And the cost of a third directory is real but bounded**, which is the other half of the argument:
sixteen `git mv`s, sixteen `[[bin]]` blocks moved between manifests, one more dependency set to
prune, a third `build.rs` (four lines, pointing at `crates/user_rt/link.ld` like the other two), and
roughly 150 path citations to repoint. 175 measured that cost by doing the same work at four times
the scale, and it is about an hour.

## The argument for doing it anyway, and for doing it soon

**A reader meets a directory before they meet anything in it.** `components/` with `wc.rs` next to
`net_stack.rs` tells a newcomer that those two things are the same kind of thing, and the tree's own
`notes/adding-a-program.md` now has to spend a paragraph saying they are not.

**Doing it later costs the repoint twice.** That is milestone 175's own argument for performing the
`interrupt_heeder`/`interrupt_ignorer` renames in the same change that moved the files, quoted from
its block: *"this milestone moves both files anyway and doing it twice is the cost of doing it
early."* The same sentence applies here one level out.

## What a decision needs to settle

1. **Whether the third category exists at all**, or whether "component" is deliberately the broad
   word and `tools/` would be inventing a distinction the capability model does not have.
2. **The name.** `tools/` is 39's own suggestion and is already spent once in this tree
   (`tools/redoxfs_host`, a host build tool, which is a different meaning of the word and would make
   `tools/` ambiguous). `bin/` is Unix's and says nothing about authority. Others worth refusing on
   the record rather than silently: `commands/`, `programs/`, `utilities/`.
3. **Where `swish` goes.** It is the shell, so it is what *runs* the tools rather than one of them,
   and it is as plausibly the spine as it is a tool.

## What it does not decide

Whether `net_transport` gets lifted into a crate (milestone 175's block leaves that open), and
whether `crates/` gets 39's three-audience split (39 named that as a separate strain and 175
explicitly refused to fold it in).
