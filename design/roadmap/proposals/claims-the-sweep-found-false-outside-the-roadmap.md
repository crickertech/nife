# The same stale claim, in the code and the notes, where no roadmap gate reads it

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-03.** Written by the milestone 252 sweep, which found each of these
while checking a `PARTIAL` block's claims against the tree.

**Gate: NONE.** Every item is a comment or a note, each one verifiable by reading the file beside
it.

**In brief.** Milestone 252 swept 22 `PARTIAL` blocks and corrected them. **The blocks were rarely
the only place the wrong sentence lived.** A stale claim that had been copied into a rustdoc, a
module header or a note stayed wrong after the block was fixed, and nothing in the tree reads those.
This is the list, so that fixing the roadmap does not leave the tree quietly disagreeing with it.

## The list

- **`crates/capability`'s `ENUMERATE` rustdoc** says only the rendezvous object consults the right
  and that the address space will "when `pmap` is built". `pmap` was built 2026-08-23 and
  `kernel/src/syscall.rs`'s address-space list arm checks the right today. The same sentence sits in
  a comment on that file's retype arm.
- **`notes/process-view.md`** still records the display-name authority question as undecided, which
  milestone 126's block answered on 2026-08-26.
- **`notes/crates-io-on-nife.md`** rows 19 and 28 still say no verb reports or sets an mtime.
  `crates/filesystem_proto` has carried all three verbs since §112 was decided on 2026-08-23, and the
  PAL's own comments under `patches/std-nife/overlay/` repeat the dead claim a third time.
- **`crates/abi`'s start invocation** is documented as ignoring its three arguments, which both the
  kernel's own arm and the builder's call contradict. Found by milestone 139's round 7 and left for
  whoever next touched the file.
- **`design/decisions/102-frame-names-a-run.md`** says the decision is still unbuilt and quotes
  milestone 142's block saying nobody is building it. It is built: the page-frame object carries a
  count and the compositor sizes a scanout over 311 frames.
- **`notes/live-replacement.md`** says the interactive stack is not running under the test harness,
  which three kernel test files disprove, and milestone 177's block quotes the stale sentence
  approvingly.
- **`notes/register-of-measures.md`** still names milestone 75's authority question as open, after
  §139 decided it and milestones 229 and 237 built it.
- **`kernel/src/arch/aarch64/timer.rs`** asserts that nothing in this tree reads the cycle counter
  from EL0, which a test in `kernel/src/user/tests.rs` does.
- **`user/src/session_reviver.rs`**'s module doc and six inline comments cite a durable-session type
  that was deleted with the SMB implementation on 2026-08-30.
- **`design/roadmap/142-a-text-display-worth-living-in.md`** carries sixty lines of verbatim
  duplicated text, three paragraphs pasted twice during its 2026-08-27 edit.

## Why this matters

`script/roadmap --check` reads paths cited in a `## Follow-on` bullet and nothing else, so a claim
in a rustdoc is invisible to every gate this project has. Milestone 247's note already records the
same shape: a `Recorded.` bullet citing a path is the only reason the `crates/regions` rename rot was
ever found. These are the claims a reader meets first, because a reader in the code does not open the
roadmap.

## BUGS

- **A list like this is a snapshot and it starts rotting the day it is written.** It is a worklist,
  not a mechanism, and the mechanism question (what would have caught these) is genuinely open: none
  of them is greppable in the way a path citation is.
- **It is not exhaustive.** The sweep read 22 blocks and the code each one pointed at. A claim in a
  file no `PARTIAL` block happens to cite was never looked at.
