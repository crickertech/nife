# A legacy virtio-mmio slot panics the kernel's scan, where skipping it is the answer

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-10.** Found by the lane that built
`design/roadmap/proposals/time-the-hw-entropy-step.md`, which met it as a boot panic in a step that
had nothing to do with virtio.

**Gate: NONE.** It is one `debug_assert_eq!` in `kernel/src/virtio.rs` and whatever the tree decides
should stand in its place, plus a test that a legacy slot is not returned.

**In brief.** `virtio::find_by_device_id` walks the mmio slots, matches on `DeviceID`, and then
`debug_assert_eq!`s that the slot's `VERSION` register is 2 (modern virtio). A slot that reports 1
is a device this kernel deliberately does not drive, and the honest answer to meeting one is the
same as meeting a slot of the wrong type: **keep walking**. What happens instead is a panic, in a
debug build, at whatever point in the boot happened to ask.

**How it presented, which is the argument for changing it.** On 2026-09-10 the riscv64 boot tour
grew a step that scans for a virtio-rng. Booted with `NIFE_RNG=1` and no `NIFE_DISK`, the runner
attached a legacy RNG (the `-global` that selects modern mmio lived inside the disk block; fixed
separately, in both runners) and the kernel panicked with `expected modern virtio-mmio, left: 1,
right: 2` at a point in the tour that names no device and gives a reader nothing to go on. The
runner bug is fixed; the shape that turned a missing command-line flag into a kernel panic is not.

**Why it survived.** Every leg of the suite builds disks, so the global was always present and no
legacy slot has ever existed on a machine this repository boots. The assertion has therefore never
fired in CI and never will; it fires only for someone assembling a QEMU command line by hand, which
is exactly the person least equipped to read it.

**What to weigh, because the assertion is not obviously wrong.** It was written as a tripwire for a
runner that had silently stopped selecting modern virtio, and that is a real failure worth catching:
a scan that skipped quietly would report "no device" where the truth is "a device this kernel
declines to drive", and milestone 145's `None` path already means the first thing. So the choice is
between skipping with a printed line that says which slot was declined and why, and keeping the
panic with a message that names the missing runner flag. The first is probably right (a kernel
should not die of a device it does not want) but the second is defensible and the difference is a
judgement about who the reader is.

**Blocked until it is answered:** nothing.
