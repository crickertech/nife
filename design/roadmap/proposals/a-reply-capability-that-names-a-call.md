# A reply capability names a thread, so only a sweep keeps it from answering the wrong call

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-04.** Written by the milestone 254 lane, out of the hazard that
milestone shipped a mitigation for rather than a fix.

**Gate: NONE.** No decision is owed. It changes `Object::Reply`'s payload, which is kernel-internal
(the capability is minted by the kernel, never forged and never delegated, so no wire format and no
user program agrees on its shape), and it wants a lane that can also state the new invariant as a
Kani property.

**In brief.** `cap::reply_cap` mints `Object::Reply(tid)`: a generational **thread** name and
nothing else. No call sequence number, no rendezvous, no nonce. So `sched::ipc_reply`'s guard can
only ask *is this thread parked awaiting some reply*, not *is this thread awaiting **this** reply*,
and the rendezvous in `wait_on` is discarded with a `_`. Give the payload a call identity, and the
guard can ask the second question.

## Why it is worth doing, given that the hazard is closed

**It is closed by a sweep, which is rung two of AGENTS.md's ladder, and a call identity is rung
one.** Milestone 254 deletes every `Object::Reply(caller)` in the machine before it frees a stranded
caller, which is seL4's non-MCS answer (`cteDeleteOne(callerCap)`, reached from `cancelIPC`). That
is correct today because the sweep runs at all four places a server can stop being able to answer.
The property it maintains is *"no unconsumed reply capability names a thread that has left its
park"*, and nothing in the type system says so: a fifth way for a server to stop answering, added by
somebody who has not read `strand_reply_caller`, reopens the hazard silently.

With a call identity there is nothing to maintain. A stale capability names a call that is over, the
guard compares and refuses, and no sweep has to have been remembered.

**The hazard is not hypothetical and two systems document it.** L4Re warns that a partner may still
hold the temporary reply capability after a finite receive timeout and *"may use this capability to
reply to the caller at a later, unexpected time specifying an arbitrary IPC label"*. Zircon says the
same about `zx_channel_call` timing out: a later reply *"could match another outbound request"*.
Both quotes and their sources are in notes/blocked-thread-teardown.md.

**And it removes a cost.** The sweep is 128 x 16 comparisons per caller freed, on a teardown path
today. A deadline on `CALL` (milestone 106) would move that cost onto a timer, where it is a
different question.

## Sketch

`Object::Reply(ThreadId)` becomes `Object::Reply(ThreadId, CallId)`, where the call identity is a
counter on the caller's own `Thread`, bumped by `ipc_call` at each park. `cap::reply_cap` reads it;
`ipc_reply` compares it against the caller's current one and drops the reply if they differ, which is
the same disposition it already gives a caller that is not reply-parked at all. `strand_reply_caller`
then needs no sweep, and can bump instead.

**What it does not decide.** Whether the sweep should be kept anyway, on the argument that a
capability naming a finished call is garbage worth collecting even when it is harmless. That is a
judgement about capability-table pressure, and it is cheap either way.

## What is blocked until it is answered

Nothing. Milestone 254 shipped the mitigation, and the property holds today.
