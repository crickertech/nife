# The proof-scope predicate runs the whole suite for changes that cannot reach a harness

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-03.** Written by the milestone 247 sweep, from milestone 119's block.

**Gate: NONE.** The predicate is one Python block inside `script/verify`, it has no dependency on
any other milestone, and a change to it is exercised by the wiring it lives in.

**In brief.** `script/verify --affected-since <base>` decides whether a pull request needs the Kani
suite by attributing every changed file to a crate and asking whether that crate is in a harness
crate's dependency closure. Anything it cannot attribute runs the proofs, which is the correct
default and is also where the false positives come from. Milestone 119 named three of them. One,
`scripts/` being spelled differently from `script/`, was fixed on 2026-08-26 and the fix is
commented in place. Two remain: any `Cargo.lock` touch proves everything, and a binary file falls
through to `not attributable to a crate; runs by default`.

## Why this matters

The prover is the merge queue's long pole. A group build goes green while `verify` is still
running, every time, so every needless full run is real waiting on the critical path, and the
comment in `script/verify` already prices one instance of it: a one-line comment added to
`script/citations` cost a 40-minute suite on a red trunk. Milestone 119 measured that these blind
spots are nearly all of the remaining tail, and priced fixing them **above** adding more shards,
because `glob`'s proofs are atomic at 15.0 minutes and are half the suite's time on their own. More
runners cannot divide one harness; a narrower scope predicate can skip it.

The two open cases are not equal. `Cargo.lock` is the harder one and the current behaviour is
defensible: a lockfile bump can move a registry dependency inside a harness crate's closure, and
those packages live outside the repository, so no diff names a file that attributes to them. Making
this precise means reading which package versions the diff actually moved and asking whether any of
them is in the closure, rather than treating the file as opaque. A binary file is the easy one: a
`.png` under `user/` or an image fixture is not an input to `cargo kani` under any reading, and it
falls through only because the attribution step has nothing to say about it.

## Where it came from

Milestone 119's block, on what remained after sharding: *"that tail is nearly all false positives
from three blind spots in the scope predicate (`scripts/` is not `script/`, a `Cargo.lock` touch
proves everything, binary files count). Fixing those beats more shards ... Each is its own small
lane."* Its Follow-on records the same thing as `**Proposed.**`, alongside a refusal of more
shards for the reason above.

## What it would take

Two edits in the `--affected-since` block, each with a test of its own. The binary case can be a
classification beside the documentation one. The `Cargo.lock` case needs `cargo metadata` on both
sides of the diff, or a parse of the lockfile's own package list, and it should keep failing toward
running when anything about the comparison is unavailable, which is the posture the surrounding
code already takes.
