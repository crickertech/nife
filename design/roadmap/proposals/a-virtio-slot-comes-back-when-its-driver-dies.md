# A virtio slot should come back when its driver dies

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-24.** Raised by milestone 198 (a package manager)'s rung 3a consumer
lane, whose package-fetch test was the first thing to run the virtio device table out after its
thirty-third slot: both QEMU legs panicked with `more virtio devices than MAX_DEVICES` in CI. The
lane took the tenth bump (to 34) and wrote this down, because `kernel/src/virtio.rs`'s own comment
on `MAX_DEVICES` names the unregister as "the next lane's work item" and a bump is not that.
**Name provisional**: this file's stem is a lane's coinage.

**Gate: DECISION.** Reusing a slot means a stale `Object::Virtio` capability must not resolve to the
device that took its slot next, which needs a generational name on the table, the machinery region
slots and thread ids already use. That changes what a capability means, which DECISIONS §16 (object
revocation) treats as a design fork rather than a task. The seventh receipt in the comment also
names the other half: whether a transport can be handed to a second driver after the first
programmed the device, and how that meets `entropy_service::ensure`'s one-service-per-device rule.

## The measurement

`MAX_DEVICES` counts every transport a boot has *ever* registered, never how many exist: the
aarch64 machine has five devices and the suite registers thirty-four. Ten bumps are recorded in the
comment, each a receipt. The memory reason one lane gave for refusing a bump was fixed on
2026-08-16 (frames come back with `Holding::release_or_fail`), so the counter is now the only
ceiling, and it binds on every lane that adds a confined-device test.

## Exit criterion

A test that registers and releases more transports than `MAX_DEVICES` in one boot passes, and a
capability to a released device is refused rather than resolving to its successor.

## Index row

The virtio device table never reuses a slot, so every confined-device test costs one for the rest
of the boot; ten bumps so far. Proposed: a generational unregister on driver death.
