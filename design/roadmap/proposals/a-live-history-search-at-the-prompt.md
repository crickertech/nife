# A live history search at the prompt

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-26.** Raised by the coordinator's brief to milestone 47 (navigation and
naming)'s lane `milestone/47-line-editing`, recorded rather than built. The stem is provisional.

**Gate: NONE.** Shell-side, in `crates/line_editor` (DECISIONS §227 (how Tab reaches the shell)
option D put the engine in the shell).

## What it is

`^R` starts an incremental search backwards through history, as bash and fish do: each key
narrows it, `^R` again finds the next older match, Enter runs it and `^G` or `^C` gives up. The
engine's history is eight entries today, so this is worth building alongside a longer history.

## Exit criterion

Host tests in `crates/line_editor` for the narrowing, the repeat, accepting and abandoning, with
the screen model the crate's tests already use.

## Index row

The prompt has no incremental history search. Proposed: `^R` in the line editor, with a longer
history behind it.
