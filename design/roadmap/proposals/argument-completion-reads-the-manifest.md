# Tab completes an argument from the program's manifest

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-26.** Raised by the coordinator's brief to milestone 47 (navigation and
naming)'s lane `milestone/47-line-editing`, which built name completion (DECISIONS §227 (how Tab
reaches the shell) option D) and recorded this rather than building it. The stem is provisional.

**Gate: NONE.** Shell-side, over the line the shell now edits itself, with no wire change.

## What it is

Tab after a program name offers every entry of the directory today (`swish::complete`'s BUGS). A
program's manifest (`grant_plan::Manifest`) already says what it takes: a file to read, a file to
write, a directory, a memory range, options. Completion could offer only what fits. `rm <Tab>` would
offer names, `rm -<Tab>` the options its manifest declares, and a builtin such as `cd` directories only. It is
the same property as the rest of this shell: what is offered is what the line could grant.

## Exit criterion

Host tests in `crates/swish` showing a directory-only position offers no files, and an option
position offers the manifest's options and nothing else.

## Index row

Argument completion offers every name in the directory regardless of the program. Proposed:
complete an argument from what the program's manifest says it takes.
