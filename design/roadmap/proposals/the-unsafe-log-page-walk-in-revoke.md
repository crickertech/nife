# `revoke.rs`'s log-page walk restates one safety argument in six places

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-03.** Written by the milestone 252 sweep, from milestone 139's block.

**Gate: NONE.** It is one file, the helper already exists, and the ratchet in `script/lint` is the
measurement that says whether the change worked.

**In brief.** `kernel/src/revoke.rs` walks its per-space log-page chain inside six separate
`unsafe` blocks, and each one restates in a comment what the helper's own safety section already
says. Milestone 139's round 8 named this as its next target and asked for a milestone; nobody minted
one, and the round-8 report was the only place the request lived. Collapse the six into whatever
shape carries the obligation once, the way rounds 3 through 7 did for the framebuffer, the register
maps and the mapped windows.

## Why this matters

Milestone 139's whole argument is that an `unsafe` block is a proof obligation, and that six copies
of one obligation is six chances to get it wrong while the ratchet counts it as six facts. The six
sites here are the largest remaining cluster in the kernel outside `arch/` and `sched.rs`, and
`sched.rs` is blocked on a typestate decision that is calef's. This one is not blocked on anything.

## What it needs

- Read the six sites and the helper's `# Safety` section, and decide whether the obligation is one
  argument or genuinely six.
- If one: a wrapper or an iterator that discharges it once, with the comment moved to the wrapper.
- If six: say so in `notes/unsafe-obligations.md` and record it as irreducible, which is a result
  and closes the item honestly.
- Re-measure the ceiling from the merged tree, per that note's own rule, rather than from this
  branch.

## BUGS

- **A wrapper can hide an obligation rather than discharge it**, which is the failure mode round 6
  flagged for the mapped windows: if the wrapper's own safety argument is weaker than the six it
  replaced, the count improves and the kernel does not. The measure is the argument, not the number.
- **Nothing here has a customer.** It is verification hygiene, so under the ranking function it
  loses to anything on a customer path the day one exists.
