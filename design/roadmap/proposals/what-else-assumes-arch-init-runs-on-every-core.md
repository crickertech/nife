# What else assumes `arch::init` runs on every core

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-20.** Found by milestone 447 (a thread's vector registers are its own),
which hit the instance and named the class in its own report. The instance is fixed in that
milestone; the class is not audited, and this is that audit.

**Gate: NONE.** Three call sites and a reading of each boot path.

## The instance, which is evidence rather than anecdote

447 put its floating-point initialisation in `arch::init`, on the reasonable assumption that a hook
by that name runs when a core comes up. It was **green on aarch64 and x86_64 and silently wrong on
RISC-V**, where the boot hart installs `stvec` through `arch::exceptions::init()` directly and never
passes through `arch::init` at all.

**Silent is the word that matters.** OpenSBI hands the kernel a hart with `sstatus.FS` already open,
so no thread ever took the first-use trap, so nothing faulted: two threads shared a register file
and every test passed. The lane found it by reasoning about the boot path rather than by a failure,
which is the kind of discovery that does not repeat reliably.

## What to audit

`arch::init()` has three call sites (`kernel/src/main.rs` twice, `kernel/src/smp.rs` once). For each
architecture, establish which cores actually reach it, and then read what is initialised there
against that answer. The question for every item is the one 447 had to ask: **is this per-core
state, and does every core run this code?**

Three failure shapes to look for, because they are what makes this worth a lane rather than a grep:

- **Per-core state set on one core.** The 447 shape exactly.
- **State that happens to be correct by inheritance**, like `sstatus.FS` arriving open from firmware,
  where the bug is invisible until the firmware changes or a second core boots differently.
- **Initialisation that is per-core on one architecture and global on another**, which reads as a
  portability question and is really a correctness one.

## What would make it stay fixed

Open, and worth more than the audit. The name `arch::init` is a claim about when it runs, and on one
architecture that claim is false; a reader meeting the name cannot tell. Whether the answer is a
rename (calef's), a comment at each call site, or a structural change that gives per-core bring-up
its own hook, is exactly the sort of thing to decide with the audit's findings in hand rather than
before them.
