# A TLS stack, and the fork is not "OpenSSL or not" but what we are trying to prove

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-05.** Written after calef asked whether a milestone covered OpenSSL. None
did, and the tree mentions it once, incidentally, in `design/fat-binaries.md` as an example of
hand-rolled function multiversioning alongside glibc and BLAS.

**Gate: MILESTONE 66.** That gate covers the server half only; the client half is gated on nothing
and could start today, which the table below sets out. Neither is urgent, and this is a proposal
rather than a milestone for one reason: **nothing is blocked on it today.**

## The principle is already settled, so this is not a write-or-take question

[§46](../../decisions/46-dependency-rule.md) is explicit that crypto goes on the take side, and the
reason is stated: *"correctness there includes resistance to attacks not yet published and
side-channel behaviour no specification states, and that is bought by years of exposure and review.
A proof that our AES matches the spec would not make it safe to use."*

So nife takes a TLS stack. **The fork is which one, and it splits on what the choice is meant to
demonstrate rather than on engineering taste.**

## Three answers, and they are not mutually exclusive

**`rustls` is the engineering answer.** Rust, no C build system, and it uses the entropy this tree
already has. Milestone 66 already assumes it by name: *"TLS: none. `rustls` needs entropy (have it)
and a large crypto surface."* [§83](../../decisions/83-rust-over-c-implementations.md) points the
same way, and its reasoning is specifically about hostile bytes: the vulnerability history of
comparable parsers *"is dominated by heap overflows and out-of-bounds access. That is the class Rust
removes by construction rather than by care."*

**OpenSSL is the ecosystem answer**, and the reason is risk 1: *only software written for nife runs
on nife*. Real software links OpenSSL. Choosing `rustls` gives nife TLS; it does not give nife the
ability to run a program that expects `libssl`. Those are different claims and only one of them is
about the ecosystem.

**And the third is the interesting one: OpenSSL confined is a demonstration rather than a
dependency.** It is the most security-critical C library in the world and the canonical large C blob
that everyone is obliged to trust. This tree has [§31](../../decisions/31-foreign-language-seam.md)'s
seam, `c_shim`, `c_confiner`, `c_swappable`, and milestone 202's 26 enumerated confinement claims
with replayable falsifications. **Running OpenSSL where a compromise reaches nothing is
[§14](../../decisions/14-project-direction.md)'s thesis as a concrete object**, and it is
[§145](../../decisions/145-compartmentalization-at-process-cost.md)'s argument with a name everybody
recognises.

Milestone 36 already ranks foreign components and would place this: it calls **SQLite** the
canonical *"C you cannot beat"* and puts it at tier three. OpenSSL is the same tier and a better
demonstration, because unlike SQLite it has a credible Rust alternative, which means taking the C one
would be a **choice about what to prove** rather than a lack of options.

## The split nobody has written down, and it is the useful part

**Client-side TLS and server-side TLS are different milestones with different consumers.**

| | who needs it | blocked on |
|---|---|---|
| **client** | milestone 198 (a package manager), fetching what it installs; milestone 99 (`git` on nife), for the `clone` half; milestone 174 (nife as a thin development client), reaching its build service | nothing |
| **server** | milestone 66 (Vaultwarden) | 66's own concurrency gap: `ACCEPT` re-arms but the backlog is one connection deep |

Client-side needs `connect`, which has existed since the contract did. **So the half with three
consumers is the half that is not blocked**, and it is the one to build first if either is built.

**Milestone 174 is explicit that it can wait:** *"TLS is not a hard prerequisite for a first cut.
nife has no TLS/crypto stack today."*

## Why this is a proposal and not a milestone

**No consumer is blocked today.** 198 has not chosen a format or a transport, 99 is `NOT-STARTED`
and its local half needs no network at all, 174 says it can start without TLS, and 66 is the largest
single item on the roadmap and gated elsewhere. A milestone minted now would sit `NOT-STARTED`
behind four other things and teach nobody anything.

**What would turn it into one** is any of: 198 choosing a transport that needs HTTPS, 99 reaching the
`clone` half, or a decision that the confined-OpenSSL demonstration is worth doing for its own sake
rather than for a consumer. That last one is the most likely and it is
[§145](../../decisions/145-compartmentalization-at-process-cost.md)'s to trigger.

## What the tree has today

`argon2`, `subtle`, and `aes`. That is the whole crypto surface, and `aes` exists because RedoxFS
needs it. There is no hash, no signature, no key exchange, and no certificate parsing. **A package
manager needs signature verification before it needs a transport**, which is a smaller and nearer
piece of the same surface and may deserve its own proposal.

## BUGS

- **Nobody has checked whether `rustls` builds here.** `notes/crates-io-on-nife.md` probed 27 crates
  and `rustls` was not among them. Its dependency graph (`ring` or `aws-lc-rs` by default) is exactly
  the class that note calls C, and `ring` is recorded there as failing class C *"via C and assembly"*.
  **So "rustls is the easy answer" is an assumption this proposal is making and has not tested.**
- **The confined-OpenSSL idea is priced nowhere.** OpenSSL wants files, sockets, threads, time and a
  build system, and milestone 66 already says the smaller SQLite needs *"the §31 seam plus real
  filesystem locking"*.
- **This proposal names no first consumer**, which by AGENTS.md's ranking function is a reason to
  rank it below anything that has one.
