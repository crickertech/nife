# Every fixed-size table but one is raised only after it has failed silently

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-03.** Written by the milestone 247 sweep, from milestone 231's block.

**Gate: NONE.** The pattern exists and works. Milestone 231 built the gauge for
`CAPABILITY_TABLE_SLOTS`, `sched::MAX_THREADS` has an older separate one, and the remaining tables
need either the same treatment or a decision that one mechanism serves all of them. Either route is
startable today.

**In brief.** `CAPABILITY_TABLE_SLOTS` now reports `capability slots: 21 of 24 at peak` on every
boot, and `script/shell-check` fails if the kernel flagged a boot as having gone past the peak
recorded beside the constant. No other fixed-size table has that. `MAX_REGIONS` and
`nifefs::NAME_LEN` have no gauge at all. `sched::MAX_THREADS` has its own `PEAK_THREADS`, built
separately and reported differently. So the shape is being solved once per table by hand.

## Why this matters

The argument for the first gauge applies unchanged to the rest, and milestone 231's block makes it
in the strongest available form: `CAPABILITY_TABLE_SLOTS` was raised three times and **every raise
was reactive, after a silent failure that named something else**. Milestone 230 is the worked
example, and it cost a bisect: a virtio-rng attached, init trapping at `user_rt::trap` with no
message, and the cause was slot exhaustion in `crates/system_initializer`. Nothing about the failure
said "table full".

Every ungauged constant still has that property. A table that fills produces a failure somewhere
downstream, in whatever code first cannot get a slot, and the distance between the cause and the
symptom is the whole cost. The gauge closes it by making the approach visible before the wall is
hit, which is the difference between a number on a boot line and a bisect.

The second reason is the one that makes this a proposal rather than three copies of a patch.
Solving the same shape once per table by hand is how `sched::MAX_THREADS` ended up with a mechanism
that does the same job under a different name and prints in a different place. A reader now has to
know both. One more hand-rolled gauge makes three.

## The fork inside it, which is small

Whether to generalise or to repeat is worth deciding rather than defaulting into. A shared mechanism
means one place to read, one output format, and one check in `script/shell-check`; it costs an
abstraction over constants that differ in kind, since `nifefs::NAME_LEN` is a length bound on a name
and not a count of live objects, and forcing those into one gauge may be the wrong shape. Repeating
costs a reader a new name per table. A lane can settle this by looking at what the three remaining
constants actually bound, and should say which it chose and why.

## Where it came from

Milestone 231 (nothing counts how many capability slots a boot actually uses) named it: *"Build the
same high-water gauge for the other fixed-size tables, or decide that one mechanism should serve all
of them. `MAX_REGIONS` and `nifefs::NAME_LEN` have no gauge at all and `sched::MAX_THREADS` has its
own separate `PEAK_THREADS`, so the shape is being solved once per table by hand and every ungauged
constant is still raised only after it has failed silently."*
