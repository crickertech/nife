# Nobody has drawn the capability-shaped way past one IPC round trip per file request

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-03.** Written by the milestone 247 sweep, from milestone 138's block.

**Gate: NONE.** Drawing the design is a lane's work and can start today: frames are already
capabilities, the residual is already measured, and the alternatives milestone 138 refused are
already written down with their reasons. What the design *concludes* is a change to a contract two
programs agree on, so it lands as a `design/decisions/` entry for calef rather than as code.

**In brief.** After milestone 138's three steps, a file request costs about 13 microseconds of
residual that no cache removes, because the shape of the contract is one IPC round trip per
request. The capability-shaped answer is to grant the client frames it can read directly, which is
what `mmap` over a page cache buys Linux. The primitive exists here already: frames are
capabilities, they are shared rather than moved, and rights narrow at send. Nobody has drawn the
design, so the residual is currently a frontier described in prose.

## Why this matters

It is the last term. Milestone 138 removed the 208 microsecond fixed cost with a metadata cache and
raised the transfer size to 64 KiB, and what remains is not a slow implementation of the current
contract, it is the current contract. No further tuning reaches it. That makes this the difference
between a file service that is fast for a microkernel and one that is fast, which is the
comparison this project exists to make.

It is also the interesting half from a demonstrator's point of view. Linux gets `mmap` performance
by handing a process a mapping into a global page cache, and the confinement questions that raises
are answered by the ambient authority model. Here the same performance would come from a
capability that says exactly which bytes, with exactly which rights, revocable. If that works, it
is a result about capability systems and not only about this file server. If it does not work, the
reason is worth writing down, because it is a claim about the model.

The questions the design has to answer are the ones milestone 138 refused a data cache over:
coherency between a client reading frames and a server writing them, what a client observes when
the file changes underneath it, and what revocation means mid-read. The metadata cache had none of
those because it lives inside one server's address space. This has all of them, which is why it is
a design and not an optimisation.

## Where it came from

Milestone 138's Follow-on: *"Design the capability-shaped way past the ~13 us per-request residual:
grant the client frames it can read directly instead of one IPC round trip per request, which is
what `mmap` over a page cache buys Linux. Frames are already capabilities here, so the primitive
exists and nobody has drawn the design. Until someone does, the residual stays a frontier described
in prose."*

The same block's refusals are the constraints this design inherits. Replacing RedoxFS was ruled out
on measurement: 94% of the old fixed term was the absence of a cache, not a property of the store,
and any replacement arrives needing the identical cache. A `READV`-shaped scatter list and a
negotiated channel size were both declined because every existing agreement between a client and
this wiring is a compile-time constant both sides carry, and a new concept on the wire has to earn
its way past that.
