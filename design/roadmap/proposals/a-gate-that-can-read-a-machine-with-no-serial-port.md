# A gate can read a serial-less machine's screen only under QEMU, and the fleet is not virtual

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-04.** Written by milestone 243's lane, from its own block's second
problem.

**Gate: MILESTONE 242.** The mechanism this needs is a write to the boot medium, and the boot medium
on every machine in the fleet is a USB mass-storage device nife cannot yet talk to. Milestone 242 is
USB host and HID; the host controller is the half this waits on.

**In brief.** Milestone 243 answered the half of its block that a **human** needs: on a UEFI machine
with no serial port the boot tour is now painted into the firmware's linear framebuffer, so a person
standing in front of Graeme's laptop can watch nife boot. It did **not** answer the half a **gate**
needs on real hardware. The screen check it added (`board_console::screen`, driven by
`cargo xtask uefi-boot`) works by asking QEMU's monitor for a screendump, and nobody can ask a Dell
for one.

So the state of the fleet after 243 is: six machines can be brought up **by hand**, with a person
reading a monitor and taking a photograph, which is precisely the state milestone 216 got the
VisionFive 2 *out* of for boards that do have a serial port.

## What it would be

**Postmortem to the boot medium.** The stick the machine booted from is a FAT32 EFI system
partition that a person is going to carry back to patagonia anyway. A kernel that appended its
console transcript to a file on it would turn "photograph the screen" into "plug the stick in and
run the gate", and `board_console::progress` would judge the result unchanged, exactly as it judges
a screendump and a serial log today.

Three pieces, in the order they block each other:

1. **USB mass storage**, which is milestone 242's neighbourhood rather than this proposal's.
2. **A FAT32 writer**, or a raw reserved region on the stick with a known offset, which is the much
   cheaper answer and is worth pricing first: the loader knows where its own image sits and could
   reserve a span at image time.
3. **A transcript buffer in the kernel**, which is new state on the diagnostic path and wants
   arguing about rather than assuming (`screen_console` deliberately holds no buffer at all).

## What it is not

**Not a network console.** Milestone 243's note priced that: it needs a NIC driver per machine and
says nothing until the stack is up, so it cannot report the failures that happen before it, and a
machine whose only voice is the network cannot report a network failure.

**Not a photograph read by a program.** `board_console::screen` decodes a *screendump*: pixel-aligned
bytes with exact glyph matches and no threshold to tune. A phone camera produces none of those
properties, and the honest cost of making it work is optical character recognition, which is a
different project.

## Why it is worth a milestone rather than a `BUGS` entry

Because it is the difference between six machines being *usable* and six machines being *in the
test loop*, and the project's own ranking function is the shortest path to a system a customer runs.
A machine that needs a person present to say anything cannot soak, cannot be woken on a schedule,
and cannot produce the boot-lottery samples milestone 249 wants. It is recorded in
`notes/serial-less-output.md`'s `BUGS` as well, where a reader meets the feature.
