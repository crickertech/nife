# A region retypes a frame run

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-26.** Raised by the lane for milestone 23 (a capability-routed component
OS with live replacement) while starting the handoff page count the `line_editor` swap needs. Its
state with history is a little over one page (notes/interactive-stack-swap.md).

**Gate: DECISION.** It changes the meaning of an argument of an existing method,
`MemoryRegion::RETYPE`, which is the syscall surface and so an architect's call under §10 (process model:
capability-based, microkernel).

## The finding

§102 (a Frame names a run of pages) made a `PageFrame` capability able to name a run, and `MAP` and
`MAP_INTO` map a whole run in one call. Only the kernel can mint one. `MemoryRegion::RETYPE` takes
no arguments and always makes a one-page frame (`kernel/src/syscall.rs`, `memory_region_retype`).
So a supervisor that wants a two-page handoff page for a component has no one-capability way to
make it, although the pages it would get are already contiguous: a region hands pages out from a
watermark (`crates/memory_regions/src/table.rs`, `retype_page`).

## Options

- **A. `RETYPE`'s first argument becomes a page count, with `0` meaning one** (recommended). One
  capability per handoff, however large, which is what §102 argued for at 475 pages. Additive:
  every caller today passes zero. The region's watermark advances by the count, or the call
  refuses with `OutOfMemory` and moves nothing.
- **B. Route N one-page frames.** No kernel change. `component_plan` would need a role that resolves
  to several slots, and every instance spends N capability-table slots on one blob. Chosen only
  because it is less work, which is AGENTS.md's elegance-over-convenience test failing out loud.
- **C. Keep one page and drop history across a swap.** The coordinator's default was a page count
  instead, so this is the fallback if A and B are both refused.

## What it unblocks

The handoff page count (`component_plan::Handoff` grows `pages`), then the `line_editor` swap, then
`redoxfs_server`'s eventual handoff, which will not fit in one page either.
