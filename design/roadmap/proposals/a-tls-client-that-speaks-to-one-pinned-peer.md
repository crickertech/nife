# A TLS client that speaks to one pinned peer

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-19.** Written by the lane for milestone 442 (a crypto provider `rustls`
can use on all three bare-metal targets), which carried that block's clauses 1 and 2 and repriced
this one out of it rather than leaving it unnamed.

**Gate: DECISION.** Which provider the client is built on is calef's, stated under "The decision
this leaves" in 442's block. The handshake code is the same either way, so a lane could start
against either and rewire; naming the gate is honest about the fact that it would be building on a
crate nobody has agreed to take.

## What 442 left standing, and what it did not

442 produced a provider that builds and runs on all three architectures and computes what the
specifications say. It produced **no handshake**. `cryptography_exerciser` constructs the provider,
asks what it can negotiate, and stops there, deliberately: there is no peer, no certificate and no
socket in that program at all.

Two things are missing before a client exists, and neither is small.

**An HTTP client, which the tree does not have.** DECISIONS §196 (nife carries TLS: `rustls` for
the protocol, and a crypto provider we make work) says so in its own `BUGS`: a `git grep` for an
HTTP request line in `components/` and `crates/` finds none. `std::net`'s `TcpStream` is bound
(milestones 27 and 64), so it can be an ordinary `std` program, which is the cheap half.

**Certificate verification, which nothing has exercised.** `rustls-webpki` builds on all three
(442's table) and 442 never called it. There is no ECDSA or RSA signature vector in that
milestone's program, which its `BUGS` says plainly, so the largest remaining piece of a handshake
is proven only to compile.

## The shape §196 already chose

**One root, or one pinned key, held as a capability**, for the one repository this client talks to,
rather than a system trust store. §196's clause 4 gives the reason and it is a circularity rather
than a preference: a system-wide store has to be updated independently of the system, and the thing
that updates it is the package manager.

## What it would prove, and what it would not

It closes rung 3c of DECISIONS §157 (a trivial install is a web page, a USB drive, and packages
over the internet): a package fetched by host name from a source somebody else operates. It does **not** buy integrity, which §195 (a recipe vouches,
and the owner may overrule) already gives by digest over any transport; TLS here buys
confidentiality and knowing which host answered.

## BUGS

- **No rotation story.** 442's block carries this and it does not get smaller here: when the one
  pinned key rotates, every installed client is talking to a peer it no longer recognises.
- **No wall clock a stranger's machine can trust**, so certificate expiry is unenforceable in the
  ordinary way. 442's block names this too.
- **No cost is known.** A handshake on a board with no hardware crypto may be slow enough to
  matter, and 442 made it slower by forcing portable implementations on all three architectures.
