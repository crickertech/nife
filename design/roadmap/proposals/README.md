# What this directory is for

**This is the inbox for identified work that does not have a number yet.** It is prose, not an
index: nothing here is generated, and no gate reads this file. The list of what is currently in the
pile is `script/roadmap --proposed`, which reads the files themselves and cannot go stale.

## Why it exists

A lane that finds work it is not doing has to leave it somewhere a script can see, or it is gone.
Milestone 247 (follow-on work named by a finished milestone goes nowhere) created this directory
after the third time a finding died in a pull request body, and `AGENTS.md` states the rule it
serves: identified work leaves the lane in a tracked form, or the merge waits.

**The number is the thing a lane cannot mint**, because concurrent lanes cannot see each other and
two of them reaching for "the next milestone number" is a collision nobody notices until merge. So a
proposal carries no number, and an integrator assigns one at promotion. That is the whole reason
this directory is separate from `design/roadmap/` rather than being part of it: **a lane can add to
the roadmap here without coordinating with any other lane.**

## What a file here looks like

`<slug>.md`, lowercase and hyphenated, no number. Inside, the same three things a numbered block
opens with, checked by `script/roadmap --check`:

```
# A title, with no milestone number in it

**Status: PROPOSED <YYYY-MM-DD>.** Who raised it and what they were doing at the time.

**Gate: NONE.** Or DECISION, HARDWARE, or MILESTONE <n>, and why.
```

The date is not decoration. A proposal nobody promotes is the same burial in a new place, and age is
the only tell a script has.

## What happens to one

**Promotion is how a proposal reaches any disposition at all**, including being refused or found
moot: this directory carries exactly one status by design, so nothing can be retired in place. An
integrator gives it a number, `git mv`s it up a directory, and the numbered block's status paragraph
says it was `promoted from the proposal <slug>`, which is the phrasing `scripts/roadmap_proposals.py`
matches. The block that named the work updates its `**Proposed.**` bullet to `**Milestone N.**`, so
neither record orphans the other.

**A proposal is not a promise to build.** It is a claim that somebody found something real and wrote
it where the next person can find it. DECISIONS §71 (a limitation is promoted when it stops being a
fact and becomes a plan) draws the same line for `BUGS` entries, and it is deliberate: a pile that
implied commitment would be kept short by not writing things in it, which is the failure this
directory exists to prevent.

## Why this file is here at all

Partly to say the above. Partly because **git does not track an empty directory**, and on 2026-09-20
every proposal in it was promoted at once: the directory vanished from the index, and git's rename
detection then read two lanes' new proposals as belonging in `design/roadmap/` instead, quietly
moving them a level up. A committed file keeps the inbox on disk and the intent legible.

`README.md` is exempt from the slug rule for that reason, in
`scripts/roadmap_proposals.py`. It is the only exemption, and it is a file rather than a pattern so
that a second one has to be argued for.

*Name: recorded (milestone 247). Milestone 247 (follow-on work named by a finished milestone goes
nowhere) created this directory as the inbox for work without a number. The stems here are not tracked by
`script/names`: a proposal's slug becomes its milestone's, and calef ruled milestone titles drafts
on 2026-08-04.*
