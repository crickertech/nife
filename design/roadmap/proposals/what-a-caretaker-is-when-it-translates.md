# What a `caretaker` is, when the thing it holds is not the thing it hands out

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-14.** Found by the milestone 292 lane while naming the program that puts a
file behind a byte sink, which had been `ROLE_FILE` inside a three-role binary and so had never
needed a name of its own.

**Gate: DECISION.** `caretaker` is a word five programs already carry and every future narrowing
program will reach for, so this is a name and names are calef's. It is cheap to settle and expensive
to leave, because the next lane writing an adapter will copy whichever neighbour it happened to read.

## The two definitions, both in the tree, both load-bearing

**Definition A, narrowing.** A caretaker serves *the same protocol its client speaks*, and what it
takes away is authority rather than vocabulary. `fixtures/src/sink.rs` stated it in as many words
before milestone 292 removed the file:

> The `fs_file_caretaker` shape, one contract further out. `fs_file_caretaker` is a caretaker
> because it "serves the same `filesystem_proto` protocol its own client speaks"; this one serves a
> *different* and much smaller protocol than it speaks, and that asymmetry is the point.

`fs_file_caretaker`, `fs_subtree_caretaker` and `fs_nameset_caretaker` are all definition A. So is
`fs_file_caretaker`'s own header, which reads the word that way.

**Definition B, translating.** `components/src/terminal_sink_caretaker.rs` holds a terminal endpoint
that carries `OP_READLINE` and hands out a byte sink that cannot read. It speaks
`line_editor::proto` on one side and `byte_sink_proto` on the other, which is definition A's
explicit counter-example, and `kernel/src/user/sink_tests.rs` says so while calling it a caretaker:

> the terminal's sink is a **separate endpoint served by an adapter**, which is
> `fs_file_caretaker`'s shape

calef ratified `terminal_sink_caretaker` over `terminal_sink` on 2026-08-03, so definition B has a
ruling behind it and definition A has only prose. The prose is more precise.

## Why milestone 292 could not settle it

The lane needed a name for the file-behind-a-sink program, and `file_sink_caretaker` was the
consistency answer: the same adapter as `terminal_sink_caretaker`, for a different backend. It was
refused on collision instead, because `fs_file_caretaker` already exists and is a different thing,
and two names a reader must hold apart cost more than the consistency buys. **That is a local answer
to a global question**, which is why it leaves this behind rather than closing it.

The program shipped as `file_sink` (provisional). If definition B is the ruling, `file_sink_caretaker`
becomes the honest name and the collision is a cost to accept rather than a reason.

## What a decision needs to settle

1. **Which definition `caretaker` carries.** If it is A (narrowing, same protocol), then
   `terminal_sink_caretaker` is misnamed and there is a second word owed for the translating shape
   (`adapter` is the word both `sink_tests` and notes/sink-protocol.md already use in prose, and it
   is the word this tree reaches for when it is not naming a file).
2. **Whether `file_sink` should be `file_sink_caretaker`**, which follows from 1, and whether the
   `fs_file_caretaker` collision is tolerable if it does.
3. **Whether `caretaker` should say what it holds or what it hands out.** `terminal_sink_caretaker`
   says both, in that order, and reads well; `fs_file_caretaker` says only what it holds.

## What it does not decide

Anything about `byte_sink_proto`, which is a wire contract named for what it carries and survived the
2026-09-13 structural-versus-current sweep on its own terms. Nor about `fs_subtree_caretaker` and
`fs_nameset_caretaker`, which are definition A under either answer.
