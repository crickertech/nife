# The x86_64 kernel is linked at one physical address, so firmware picks the address and we hope

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-03.** Written by the milestone 247 sweep, from milestone 195's block.

**Gate: NONE.** A lane can start today. OVMF under QEMU reproduces the whole problem, which is how
milestone 195 found it, and nothing here waits on the OptiPlex.

**In brief.** `PHYS_START` for the x86_64 kernel moved from 1 MiB to 32 MiB so the image would clear
the low memory OVMF reserves for itself. That buys a larger gap between us and the firmware; it does
not make the image safe at any other address. Making it physically relocatable means the loader can
place it wherever the memory map actually has room, and the blocker is `.boot`: the 32-bit
trampoline's self-references are absolute, and a 32-bit instruction stream cannot name a 64-bit
address, so those references have to become position-independent before the link address can stop
mattering.

## Why this matters

The claim the current arrangement rests on is that 32 MiB is free on every machine that boots this
kernel, and nothing verifies it. Milestone 195's own `BUGS` says so: none of the UEFI path is proved
on a Dell, OVMF is not a vendor firmware, and whether the OptiPlex leaves 32 MiB free is a question
for the bench. So the failure mode is a machine-specific boot failure discovered by a person
standing at xenon, at the point in the loop where debugging costs the most. A relocatable image
turns "does this firmware happen to leave our address free" into "the loader read the memory map",
which is a question the code can answer on any machine.

It also removes a number that will be tuned again. 1 MiB became 32 MiB once already, in response to
one firmware. A third firmware with different reservations produces a third constant, and each one
is only known to be wrong after a boot fails.

## Where it came from

Milestone 195 (finish the UEFI boot path) named it on the way out: *"Make the x86_64 kernel image
physically relocatable instead of linked at one address. `PHYS_START` moved from 1 MiB to 32 MiB to
clear OVMF's low reservations, which buys a larger gap rather than a fix, and `.boot`'s absolute
self-references have to become position-independent because a 32-bit instruction stream cannot name
a 64-bit one."*
