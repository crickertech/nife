# The prompt suggests the rest of a line from history

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-26.** Raised by the coordinator's brief to milestone 47 (navigation and
naming)'s lane `milestone/47-line-editing`, which built DECISIONS §227 (how Tab reaches the shell)
option D and was told to record fish's extras rather than build them. The stem is provisional.

**Gate: NONE.** The shell edits its own line, so this is shell-side work with no wire change.

## What it is

As a line is typed, the newest history entry that starts with it is shown after the cursor in a
dim colour, and a right arrow at the end of the line accepts it. This is fish's autosuggestion.
`line_editor::LineDisc` already keeps eight lines of history; the engine would need a way to draw
text after the cursor that is not part of the line.

## Exit criterion

A host test in `crates/line_editor` shows the suggestion drawn after the cursor, erased when the
next key disagrees with it, and accepted by a right arrow at the end of the line.

## Index row

The shell could suggest the rest of a line from history as it is typed, fish's autosuggestion.
Proposed: a suggestion drawn after the cursor and accepted with the right arrow.
