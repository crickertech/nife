# An event-counter driver, so milestone 134's M6 to M8 have an instrument

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-19.** Written by milestone 134's per-IPC stack-depth lane, which
re-checked tier B against the tree after milestone 74's aarch64 half landed (PR #972).

**Gate: HARDWARE.** The code can be written and exercised under QEMU, but QEMU counts no cache or
TLB event that means anything; the reading needs radon and argon.

**In brief.** Milestone 134's M6 (I-cache misses per IPC), M7 (D-cache misses, and whether they fall
in the stack region) and M8 (TLB misses) have no instrument on any architecture. Checked
2026-09-19: nothing in `kernel/src` or `crates/` writes `PMEVTYPER<n>_EL0` or configures an SBI PMU
cache event. The hardware is there: aarch64's boot line reports six event counters visible since
milestone 74's `HPMN` fix, and the SBI PMU extension radon's firmware implements can match
`SBI_PMU_HW_CACHE_*` events.

**What to build**, in 74's own shape: per ISA, one L1I refill, one L1D refill and one TLB refill
event, started once, read before and after, kernel-internal, printed as `bench-probe:` lines. No
generic event interface; milestone 74's scope note held that back until a second consumer, and
these three measures are that consumer. Milestone 147's profiler would be a third.

**First step, and it is not code:** find out which of these events radon's OpenSBI and argon's
Cortex-A57 actually count, and whether they count them correctly. Milestone 134's own BUGS expects
some not to. That is the same order milestone 74's riscv64 half took.

**Two things to settle as it goes.** Each `PMEVTYPER<n>_EL0` carries its own exception-level
filter, so the question calef is deciding for `PMCCFILTR_EL0`
(`design/roadmap/proposals/the-aarch64-half-of-74.md`, decision A) comes up again here, and the
answer should be the same one. And M7's attribution half (do the missing lines fall in the stack
region) wants a data-address sampler that neither the A57 nor the U74 has; expect M7 to become
"misses rise with thread count" read beside the per-IPC stack depth, not an attribution.
