# A boot banner that names the build, so two cards cannot be confused for one

**Status: PROPOSED 2026-09-04.** Found by the maintainer/e3-on-radon lane, writing the bench
procedure for milestone 134's E3.

**Gate: NONE.** Small, and it makes a class of wasted bench session impossible rather than unlikely.

## In brief

E3 is a comparison of two kernels that differ in exactly one Cargo feature. Both are written to a
microSD card as the same three filenames, neither prints its feature set, and nothing on the card or
in the capture says which one booted. A session that writes the second card and forgets to relabel
its log has compared a build against itself, and **the capture is indistinguishable from a correct
one**.

The same shape applies to every card this tree writes: `--soak`, `--jobmix`, `--reboot`, `--bench`,
and the plain tour all produce `nife-vf2.img`.

## The mitigation today, and why it is not enough

`script/board-image` echoes `features: board,bench,single_hart` at build time (added by this lane),
and the operator names the log file. That is **rung four** of AGENTS.md's ladder, a note in a place
someone has to have read, and it is guarding a decision that is made twenty minutes and one power
cycle later.

## What it would be

The kernel prints its own feature set, once, in the same breath as the banner it already prints, so
the fact lives **in the capture** rather than beside it. Rung three: a written record at the thing
itself. Roughly `env!` over the enabled features at compile time, or a small `const` list assembled
from `cfg!`s; the choice between them is exactly the sort of thing that is cheaper to decide with
the code open than in a proposal.

Two properties worth holding it to. It should cost an ordinary boot nothing but one line. And it
should name the **whole** feature set rather than a curated list, because the next feature somebody
adds is the one that will be missing from a curated one.

## What it does not fix

A card written from an uncommitted working tree still says nothing about the commit. The stronger
version prints a build identity as well, which is a bigger decision (a reproducibility claim rather
than a debugging aid) and should not ride along on this one.

## Where it came from

notes/board-bench.md's BUGS, "the padded and un-padded images are indistinguishable on the card".
