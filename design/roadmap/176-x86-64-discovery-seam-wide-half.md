# 176. The x86_64 discovery seam's wide half: COM1's IRQ and a CMOS RTC

**Status: BUILT.** Minted 2026-08-25, from milestone 161's own item 0, "the wide half is
still owed and should be its own milestone." Re-scoped fresh against the current tree rather than
carried over from 161's own text, which turned out to describe a partly stale state. Piece 1 built
the same day (below); piece 2 was sized, found to need a decision
([DECISIONS §130](../decisions/130-cmos-rtc-delegation.md), ratified 2026-08-26), and built against
it (below).

## What 161's own text got right, and what it no longer does

`kernel/src/arch/x86_64/machine.rs`'s own `BUGS` section lists four device windows as "still read
from a tree by the front end and stay `None` here": the interrupt controller, the RTC, the UART's
interrupt line, and the PCIe ECAM range. **Two of those four are stale claims, checked directly
against the tree this milestone was minted from:**

- **The interrupt controller (IO APIC) is built**, milestone 161's own item 2, reached directly by
  `arch::x86_64::irq` rather than through `memory.rs`'s statics.
- **PCI is wired**, and has been since milestone 165's ACPI/MCFG work: `kernel/src/main.rs`
  calls `memory::record_pci_regions` from the ACPI `ecam` path, so `memory::pci_regions()` returns
  `Some` on x86_64 today. `machine.rs`'s own comment ("still report nothing on x86 even though the
  MCFG answered a few lines earlier") predates this and needs correcting as part of this
  milestone's own cleanup, not left standing as a live claim.

**Two are real**, and are this milestone's actual scope:

## Built: piece 1, COM1's IRQ wired, 2026-08-25

`Acpi::isa_irqs` already resolved all sixteen legacy ISA IRQs at boot; `isa_irqs[4]` is the console
UART's line. `kernel/src/main.rs`'s boot tour now reads it (`acpi.isa_irqs[4].gsi`) and hands it to
a new `memory::record_uart_irq`, the same-shaped setter `memory::record_pci_regions` already was for
PCI: it fills `memory::UART_IRQ`, the exact static the other two architectures fill from their
device tree at `memory.rs` line 135. `user::uart_irq_and_source()` (already generic across all three
architectures) now reports a real answer on `x86_64` instead of always falling back to the
`UART_RX_INTID` constant; its "device tree" source string, and `memory::uart_irq()`'s matching doc
comment, were generalized to "machine description" since ACPI is now a second source feeding the
same seam. Nothing calls it yet (the x86 console is polled, as the milestone that raised this item
already said), so this is exactly what it was scoped as: filling a seam for a future reader to find
real, rather than routing an interrupt.

`kernel/src/arch/x86_64/machine.rs`'s stale `BUGS` comment was also corrected: PCI has been wired
since milestone 165 and the interrupt controller since milestone 161 item 2, neither is `None`
today, and the `BUGS` section now names only the CMOS RTC (piece 2, below) as the device window
with no seam at all.

## Built: piece 2, a CMOS RTC read by the kernel, 2026-08-25

Sizing this found a real design fork, not a shape to build: the other two architectures' RTCs are
memory-mapped, so their `RTC_REGION` seam is a physical page a driver maps and pokes directly. The
PC-compatible CMOS RTC is two fixed I/O ports, and [DECISIONS §121](../decisions/121-port-io-capability.md)'s
current (still-PROPOSED) recommendation keeps all x86 legacy port I/O kernel-resident, so the
existing "map the device, let userspace drive it" pattern has no CMOS equivalent. Full writeup, four
options considered, and the decision itself in
[DECISIONS §130](../decisions/130-cmos-rtc-delegation.md): **option 3**, the kernel reads CMOS once
at boot and hands the seed to the clock service as a `Spawn` argument, the same way `kind` already
crosses that boundary.

Built exactly against that decision. `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/rtc.rs` (new) is the kernel-side
reader: a dozen `in8`/`out8` pairs against ports `0x70`/`0x71`, the same shape as
`arch::x86_64::timer`'s PIT calibration, with the CMOS update-in-progress flag polled and a
double-read-and-compare so a read never lands mid-update, BCD-to-binary and 12h/24h decoded per
status register B, and the six raw fields turned into a Unix timestamp through the `calendar` crate
this tree already depends on rather than a second copy of that arithmetic.
`clock_proto::rtc::CMOS` (provisional; a new kind, `= 3`) is the wire-format addition: unlike
`PL031`/`GOLDFISH`, which name a register layout the service polls itself, `CMOS`'s reading has
already been taken by the kernel and arrives as data on the wall clock's second `Spawn` argument
(`arg1`), which `clock_service::start` fills only on `x86_64` (`rtc_region()` stays `None` there
forever; §121 forecloses the alternative). `user/src/clock.rs`'s `read_rtc` takes the new kind as
`Some(seed)`, no register, no base address.

`date_tests.rs`, `time_tests.rs`, `clock_tests.rs` and `ntp_tests.rs` all run on `x86_64` now
instead of skipping via `clock_service::machine_has_no_rtc()`, which itself now asks the kernel's
CMOS reader on this architecture rather than the device tree. Four of `ntp_tests.rs`'s six tests
still skip there, but for an unrelated, pre-existing reason found while wiring this up: the test
runner attaches no virtio-rng function on any bus for `x86_64` yet (notes/x86-port.md), so the NTP
client correctly refuses to reach the network without a nonce source, the same refusal
`without_entropy_the_client_refuses_rather_than_guessing` tests on purpose. `ntp_tests.rs` gained a
`machine_has_no_entropy` guard, the same convention `disk_tests`, `credential_tests` and
`entropy_tests` already use for that cause, so the four skip with a reason rather than panic; giving
`x86_64` a network entropy device is its own, unstarted piece of work.

Piece 1 is complete and independent of this.


## Follow-on

- **Decision.** `design/decisions/121-port-io-capability.md` holds the question that decided piece
  2's shape, whether userspace may ever drive x86 legacy port I/O. Its recommendation keeps port I/O
  kernel-resident and is still PROPOSED; `design/decisions/130-cmos-rtc-delegation.md` took the RTC
  question against it and is ratified, which is why `rtc_region()` stays `None` on x86_64 forever.
- **Recorded.** `crates/clock_proto/src/lib.rs` carries the new `rtc` kind, shipped as a provisional
  name like every name a lane mints. `CMOS` is unlike its siblings in kind: `PL031` and `GOLDFISH`
  name a register layout the clock service polls itself, while `CMOS` names a reading the kernel has
  already taken and passes to the service as data on its second `Spawn` argument.
- **Recorded.** `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/machine.rs`'s BUGS section had claimed for two milestones
  that the interrupt controller and the PCIe ECAM range were still `None` on x86_64, after
  milestones 161 and 165 had wired both. Corrected here, and it now names only the device windows
  that are genuinely absent.
- **Unclaimed.** Attach a virtio-rng function to the x86_64 test runner and wire it, so the NTP
  client has a nonce source there; four of `ntp_tests.rs`'s six tests skip on x86_64 without one.
  Milestone 215's block proposes this as one item in a larger x86_64 fixture lane, so take it there
  rather than as a second piece of work.
