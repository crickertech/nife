# 14. Kernel objects from untyped: remove the kernel heap

**Status: BUILT.**

**In brief.** Retype TCBs, endpoints, page tables; delete the kernel heap

**Why it matters.** **critical path:** a verifiable kernel cannot allocate. **Built:** the kernel has no allocator; see design/kernel-objects-from-untyped.md

**Deliverable.** Retype TCBs, endpoints, and page tables out of untyped memory, the way milestone 11
already does for user pages, and delete the kernel heap and slab.

**Why.** This finishes §10's deferred axis. Milestone 11 stopped the kernel allocating for *user*
memory; the kernel's own objects still come from its heap. It is also the real prerequisite for the
"small enough to verify" endgame: seL4's proof leans on a kernel that never allocates. Biggest item
here, and the seL4 long tail by reputation.

**On the critical path (§14).** The gate this used to sit behind ("is verifiability actually the
goal?") is resolved: it is. So this is no longer an optional purity win. A verifiable kernel cannot
allocate dynamically, so removing the heap is a prerequisite for verifying the kernel at scale rather
than only its pure-logic crates. It still also buys the smaller payoff on its own terms: the
kernel-heap-exhaustion class disappears entirely.

## Follow-on

- **Refused.** Sub-page object packing, meaning a decision about whether several TCBs share a page.
  Object sizes were not measured when the milestone ran, and a packing commitment made ahead of the
  measurement is a guess that later code would be built on.
- **Refused.** The capability derivation tree. Revocation stays frame-scoped, which is the
  memory-safety-critical half and is what reclamation actually wants; subtree granularity has no
  driver on the roadmap, and the argument that this is a terminal design rather than a way-station
  is in design/decisions/13-frame-revocation.md.
- **Refused.** Any change to the user-facing map and retype semantics for frames. Milestone 11's
  paths keep working, and reworking them would have cost every existing user program for nothing
  this milestone needed.
- **Recorded.** `design/kernel-objects-from-untyped.md` holds the four-step path to capability-only
  naming and why the capability payloads fall last. They still carry a generational name rather than
  a TCB pointer, which is safe because a dead name can never resolve again; the pointer form waits
  on the derivation tree refused above.
