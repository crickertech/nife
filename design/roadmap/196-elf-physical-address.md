# 196. A physical address on `elf::Segment`, or a second ELF reader forever

**Status: BUILT 2026-09-02.** The field shipped (`milestone/196-elf-paddr`, 2026-08-31). **The
second reader did not go then**, for a reason nobody predicted, and milestone 208 (the x86_64 kernel
image ships an RWX segment, and it is the reason a second ELF reader exists) is what removed it: the
image was refused by `Elf::parse` as writable-and-executable, so the loader could not use the shared
parser however many fields it had. With the linker script split, `uefi_loader` now calls
`elf::Elf::parse` and its own reader is gone, proved by booting under OVMF rather than by reading.

What survives in `uefi_loader/src/image.rs` is not a reader: it is `physical_span` over
`elf::Segment::paddr` plus this loader's own wording for every `elf::Error`, in an exhaustive match
so growing the enum breaks the build. `Elf::parse` deliberately does not provide `physical_span`,
because a program loader maps at `p_vaddr` and a firmware loader places at `p_paddr`, and on this
image they are unrelated.

**The original PARTIAL text and its reason are below**, unchanged, because the reason nobody
predicted is the useful half of this block. Minted 2026-08-30 from milestone 87's (the x86_64 bare-metal machine) lane.
*(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**The gate is discharged**, and is recorded here rather than deleted. It read
`Gate: DECISION`, because `crates/elf` is a shared definition, which AGENTS.md rule 7 makes global
to the tree and therefore calef's rather than a lane's. It was answered when the `paddr` field
shipped on 2026-08-31.

**In brief.** The UEFI loader carries its own forty-line ELF reader for one reason: `crates/elf`'s
`Segment` exposes no `p_paddr`, and in this kernel `p_vaddr` and `p_paddr` are genuinely unrelated
(`.ap_trampoline`'s `p_vaddr` is `0x8000` against a `p_paddr` of `0x12b000`, measured; see BUGS). A loader placing an image in physical memory
needs the physical address, so it re-implements the parse.

**Two readers of one format is the defect**, and it is the shape rule 7 exists to prevent: the
agreement between them is a comment, not a type.

## What is being decided

Whether `elf::Segment` widens to carry `p_paddr`. It is a small change to a crate the kernel's own
loader depends on, which is what makes it calef's rather than small.

- **Widen it.** One field, one parse site, and the loader deletes forty lines. Everything reading
  `Segment` keeps working.
- **Leave it.** The duplicate reader stays, and the next thing that loads an image physically writes
  a third.

**Decided 2026-08-31: widen it, as a plain `u64`.** The field is in the format and the crate is
simply not exposing it, which makes this a gap rather than a design change.

**And the typed version is deliberately not done here.** Making the virtual/physical confusion
unrepresentable is milestone 200 (a virtual address and a physical address stop being the same
type), which is tree-wide and ratified its own names. Typing `elf::Segment`'s two fields alone would
claim a distinction the rest of the tree does not make, and a newtype whose value every consumer
immediately unwraps is not a mechanism. So this milestone adds the field with the hazard in its doc
comment, and milestone 200 makes the mistake unsayable everywhere at once.

## BUGS

- **The field is redundant in every case but one**, and that is the hazard rather than a comfort:
  `paddr == vaddr` for every user program in this tree, so a consumer that reaches for the wrong one
  behaves correctly in testing and wrongly on the one path that matters, which is the kernel image.
  The doc comment has to carry that until milestone 200 lands, and a doc comment is rung three.

- **The addresses in the paragraph above were backwards and stale**, and the lane found it by
  building the image rather than by reading anything. `.ap_trampoline` is `p_vaddr` `0x8000` against
  `p_paddr` `0x12b000`, not the reverse: its bytes *ship* high (`AT()` puts them after `.rodata`) and
  *execute* low (a STARTUP IPI can only name a page below 1 MiB). `0x165000` was a number from an
  older build. Corrected here and in notes/elf.md, which now shows the measured headers.

- **Widening `Segment` did not, on its own, retire the UEFI loader's reader, and `p_paddr` was never
  the blocker.** `crates/elf` refuses the kernel image with `Error::WritableAndExecutable`, because
  `kernel/link-x86_64.ld` folds `.text.boot` and `.data.boot` into one output section and the 32-bit
  trampoline therefore ships as a single `RWX` `PT_LOAD` at `0x101000`. Measured: patch that one
  segment's `p_flags` to `RX` in a copy of the image and `Elf::parse` accepts the entire file, all
  ten `PT_LOAD`s, the three `NOLOAD` reservations and the trampoline's split addresses included.
  Nothing else in the validating parser objects. So the remaining work is one linker-script change
  rather than an argument about whether a validating parser suits a boot loader, and it would also
  make the kernel image obey the W^X rule `crates/elf` and `paging::Flags` enforce everywhere else.
  It belongs to whoever owns `kernel/link-x86_64.ld` (milestone 87's lane held it while this ran),
  not to `crates/elf`.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 200.** Making the virtual/physical confusion unrepresentable, deliberately not done
  here. Typing `elf::Segment`'s two fields alone would claim a distinction the rest of the tree does
  not make, and a newtype every consumer immediately unwraps is not a mechanism. So this milestone
  adds the field with the hazard in its doc comment, which is rung three, and 200 makes the mistake
  unsayable everywhere at once. The hazard is real: `paddr == vaddr` for every user program in this
  tree, so a consumer reaching for the wrong one behaves correctly in testing and wrongly on the one
  path that matters.
- **Milestone 208.** The linker-script change this block identified as the actual blocker and
  handed to whoever owns `kernel/link-x86_64.ld`. Widening `Segment` did not retire the UEFI
  loader's reader, because `kernel/link-x86_64.ld` folds `.text.boot` and `.data.boot` into one
  output section and `crates/elf` refuses the resulting `RWX` `PT_LOAD`. 208 split the sections, the
  loader now calls `elf::Elf::parse`, and its own reader is gone.
- **Recorded.** `notes/elf.md` carries the measured segment headers, after this block's own
  addresses turned out backwards and stale: `.ap_trampoline` is `p_vaddr` `0x8000` against `p_paddr`
  `0x12b000`, not the reverse, and `0x165000` was a number from an older build. The lane found it by
  building the image rather than by reading anything.
- **Refused.** Giving `Elf::parse` a `physical_span`. What survives in `uefi_loader/src/image.rs` is
  not a reader, and it stays out of the shared crate on purpose: a program loader maps at `p_vaddr`
  and a firmware loader places at `p_paddr`, and on this image they are unrelated, so the span is
  the firmware loader's own question rather than the format's.
