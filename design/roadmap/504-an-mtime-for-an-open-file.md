# 504. An mtime for an open file, not only for a name

*(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)* Promoted from the
proposal `an-mtime-for-an-open-file`, filed 2026-09-19, on calef's instruction of 2026-09-20 to give
every proposal on `main` a number. The text below is the proposal's own, unedited except for this
paragraph: the argument is its author's and promotion is not the moment to improve it. Written by
the milestone 64 (enough std to run somebody else's crate) lane (`milestone/64-std-filesystem-shim`), from milestone 64's block.

Every option that closes this puts something on the file contract, which two
programs agree on (`crates/filesystem_protocol`, the FS server, every caretaker and the `std` PAL),
and so is calef's. Declining is also an answer, and the PAL already implements it.

**In brief.** The three mtime verbs milestone 47 (navigation and naming) added for `touch` (`GETMTIME`, `SETMTIME`,
`SETMTIME_AT`, DECISIONS §112 (touch's two behaviors need two rights)) all take a **name under a directory handle**. `std` asks for a
modification time in two shapes: by path (`std::fs::metadata(p).modified()`, `std::fs::set_times(p,
..)`), which is bound as of 2026-09-19, and through an open file (`File::metadata().modified()`,
`File::set_times`, `File::set_modified`), which is refused with `Unsupported` because a handle has no
name to ask by. This asks whether the contract should answer the second shape too.

## Why this matters

Less than it sounds, and the honest ranking is the first thing to say. The path shape is the
common one: milestone 64's probe list ranked `Metadata::modified` at 19 with 5 crates behind it and
`File::set_times` at 28 with 2, and every walker (`walkdir`, `ignore`, so `ripgrep`) reaches
metadata through `DirEntry::metadata`, which is by path and works. What still refuses:

- **`File::metadata().modified()`**, which programs reach for after `File::open` when they want the
  size and the time of the thing they are about to read. A caller can call `std::fs::metadata` on
  the same path instead, and that is what the refusal's message says.
- **`File::set_modified` / `File::set_times`**, the stable (1.75) API that `tar`-shaped extractors
  and `filetime`'s std path use to restore a timestamp after writing a file's contents. There is no
  path-shaped workaround that is equally correct, because the path may have been renamed since.

The PAL could make both work today without asking anyone, by remembering the name a `File` was
opened by and asking with that. **It refuses to**, and that is the part a reader should weigh: the
answer would describe whatever holds the name *now*. After a rename or an unlink it reports another
file's time or a `NotFound` for a file the caller is holding open, and `set_times` would stamp the
wrong file and report success. Unix's `fstat` and `futimens` act on the inode, which is what a caller
means. That reasoning is recorded at `Mtime` in `patches/std-nife/overlay/std/src/sys/fs/nife.rs`.

## The options

**(a) Put the mtime in `FSTAT`'s second reply word.** The server's `reply` already sends two words
and fills the second with 0, so this is additive on the wire: an old client ignores it. It closes the
read half only. Cost: one line in the server, one in the PAL, and every caretaker taught to relay the
second word: `components/src/fs_file_caretaker.rs`'s `reply` sends a hard-coded 0 there today, so
a program behind a per-file grant would read an mtime of 0 rather than a refusal, which is the
fabricated-answer shape this proposal exists to avoid. Risk: `FSTAT` is also the PAL's
reachability probe, and a reply shape change there is the one place a mistake would make every
`std` program think it has no filesystem.

**(b) Handle-taking twins of the three verbs** (`FGETMTIME`, `FSETMTIME`, `FSETMTIME_AT`, names
provisional). Closes both halves, and it is the shape POSIX kept (`stat`/`fstat`, `utimensat`/
`futimens`). **The setter runs straight into §112**, which is the finding that makes this a real
fork rather than a binding: a file handle is hard-attenuated to `READ | WRITE` the moment it is
opened (`Server::open_file_at`), so it can never carry `dir::SETTIME`, and the arbitrary-time
authority has nothing to be checked against. Either file handles grow a `SETTIME` bit (a rights
change on every open, and the caretakers' `POLICY` table learns a new row per verb), or
`FSETMTIME_AT` is refused on every handle and only `FSETMTIME` (the server's own "now") is offered,
which is not what `File::set_modified(t)` asks for.

**(c) Decline, and keep the refusals.** What the PAL does today. `File::metadata().modified()` and
`File::set_times` answer `Unsupported` with a message naming the path-shaped call. Nothing is lost
that a caller cannot get another way except restoring a timestamp through a handle.

## The seven questions

1. **Considered and lost**: re-resolving the opened name inside the PAL (lost on correctness, above);
   a stat-by-name verb carrying size and mtime together (does not help an open file, which is the
   whole gap).
2. **What the tree does in the analogous case**: extended attributes are handle-taking (`GETXATTR`
   on an open file), so the contract already answers "a fact about the file I hold" by handle; the
   mtime verbs are the exception, deliberately, because `touch` never opens what it acts on.
3. **Prior art**: POSIX `fstat`/`futimens`; WASI's `fd_filestat_get`/`fd_filestat_set_times`, which
   `cap-std` binds to, are handle-first. Recalled rather than re-read for this proposal.
4. **Is the premise true?** Checked: `filesystem_protocol::fs::GETMTIME`'s doc says name-taking on
   purpose, `redoxfs_server`'s dispatch reads the name from the page, and the per-file caretaker
   refuses all three with `ENOTDIR` (`filesystem_protocol::grant::POLICY`).
5. **Cost, measured**: (a) is a line each in the server and the PAL plus a relay in every caretaker; (b) is three
   opcodes, three verb-table rows, three caretaker policy rows, server methods and host tests, plus
   the `SETTIME` question, which is the expensive part and is not code.
6. **Reversibility**: (c) is fully reversible. (a) and (b) are wire changes and are not.
7. **Same cost?** If (b) cost the same as (c), (b)'s getter would still win and its setter would
   still stall on `SETTIME`. The recommendation below is not about effort.

## Recommendation, and what it is not

None made, because this is a wire format. If a nudge helps: (a) is the cheap, additive read half
and could be taken alone, and the setter should wait for a customer that restores timestamps
(`tar`, a backup restore), because §112's rights question deserves a real use case.

**What is blocked until it is answered**: nothing on the customer path. Milestone 121 (`ripgrep`)
reaches metadata by path. Milestone 64 is BUILT without it; the refusals are its `BUGS` entry.

## Index row

The three mtime verbs milestone 47 added for `touch` (`GETMTIME`, `SETMTIME`, `SETMTIME_AT`,
DECISIONS §112) all take a name under a directory handle.
