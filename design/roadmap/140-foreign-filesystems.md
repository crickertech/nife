# 140. Mount a drive this system did not create

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Minted 2026-08-18 by calef, correcting a question the tree had been asking
too narrowly. Milestone 138's work had turned into "is RedoxFS the right store", and that was the
wrong frame: *"The requirement set isn't just recovery on another computer. It is using a drive
constructed and previously attached to another OS."*

**Gate: NONE.** The first increment needs nothing that does not exist, and the sequencing argument
below says which increment that is.

**In brief.** An operating system mounts media it did not format. This one cannot. `fs_server` is
bound to RedoxFS at the type level, so there is no drive on any desk in this house that nife can
read.

## The requirement, in calef's ordering

His framing, and the reason this is one milestone rather than an argument about stores: **assume we
need all of these some day and we deliver them all eventually.**

| filesystem | why | when |
|---|---|---|
| **RedoxFS** | the backup volume. Vendored, working, and the only store here with crash-consistency evidence (186 injected lying-device cases: 112 recovered, 74 refused, **0 silently wrong**) | **kept**, and this milestone does not touch it |
| **FAT32** | **USB sticks.** The format removable media actually arrives in, so it is the one a person meets first | first |
| **ext2** | Linux-native, simple, and a real interop story for a data volume. **Not a backup volume**: ext2 is ext3 without the journal, and that is the property a backup cannot give up | second |
| **ext4** | what a Linux drive is actually formatted as today | some day |
| **ZFS** | what a serious storage box runs | some day |

**RedoxFS was chosen because it could be vendored**, which let the project skip building a
filesystem and get a working one immediately. That decision stands and this block does not reopen
it. What it says is that a vendored store solved one requirement and the others were never asked.

## One program per filesystem, not one server that speaks five

**Decided in discussion with calef, 2026-08-18**, and it replaces this block's first answer, which
assumed an in-process abstraction and was wrong about where the seam is.

**The client-facing seam already exists, and it is `fs_proto`.** A client holds an *endpoint*, not a
program name. A program with a directory capability cannot tell which process is behind it and has no
reason to care. So a separate program per filesystem costs the client nothing: no API change, no
dispatch, no trait.

**Confinement is the reason, and it is the product.** A FAT32 parser reading a stranger's USB stick
is the most attacker-adjacent code this system would run: a large parser over bytes from an unknown
machine. In one server it shares an address space with the backup volume, and a bug in it reaches the
family's backups. As its own program it holds one block-device capability, cannot name the backup
volume, and has nothing to escalate to. `caps fat32_server` prints that difference, which is the
demonstration rather than an assurance.

**It is also what this tree already does.** `net_stack`, `smb_server` and `sub_server_supervisor` are
separate confined programs, `fs_server` already ships three binaries, and one of them is
`second_mount`, a second FS-server process against the same block server. A single server speaking
five formats would be the exception here, not the pattern.

**And `Server<D: Disk>` is already generic on the wrong axis for this.** It abstracts the layer
*below* (the disk). Making it also generic over the layer above is the move to avoid, and §4's
refusal of speculative trait-ification is the rule that says so.

**So what falls out of building the second filesystem is a library, not a trait**: the serve loop,
the shared-page plumbing, the `fs_proto` decode, the parts that are not filesystem-specific. That is
§94's question (what must be per-binary, and what can be lifted) rather than an abstraction over two
stores that disagree about allocation, atomicity, transactions and whether a rename can be atomic.

### `fs_server` is misnamed, and the architecture is what makes it wrong

**calef, 2026-08-18**, on reading the section above: *"Which also means fs_server is misnamed. Its
something like redoxfs_server."*

He is right, and the name was accurate until this decision. A single server for all filesystems is
`fs_server`; **one program per filesystem makes that name a claim the program cannot meet**, and the
next reader would infer that a second filesystem goes inside it, which is exactly the architecture
just refused. §39's rule applies: a name is a claim, and the reader meets it first.

`fs_proto` is **not** misnamed and should not move. It is the protocol every filesystem server
speaks, so a generic name is the true one; that the client cannot tell which server is behind its
endpoint is the whole point.

The rename is mechanical and wide (a crate directory, a package name, three binaries, every
reference), so it wants its own lane rather than riding on prose.

**It belongs to this milestone as increment zero, and not to one of its own** (calef asked which
milestone owns it, 2026-08-19). It has no independent design content: it is a consequence of the
decision above, and it is prerequisite to the first stratum rather than parallel to it, because once
FAT32 exists two servers carry names that disagree about what kind of thing they are. Milestones 46
and 63 were the naming milestones and both are `BUILT`, but each was a *sweep* of many names with
rules to write down; this is one name following from a decision already made, and minting a number
for it would be inflation.

**It must wait for milestone 138's steps to settle, and that is the constraint that actually decides
when.** `fs_server` is under active change: step 1 shipped the record level, step 3 shipped the
multi-page transfer, step 2 and step 4 are queued, and a lane is moving `smb_server` onto the larger
transfer. A rename touching a crate directory, a package name, three binaries and every reference
would conflict with all of it, in the file every one of those lanes is editing. **After 138 settles
and before FAT32 starts** is the window, and it is a real window rather than a preference: renaming
into a quiet tree is an afternoon, renaming into four open branches is a week of conflicts.

**Increment zero is built** (2026-08-25, milestone 138 having settled). `fs_server` is
`redoxfs_server` everywhere: the crate directory, the package and lib name, the `redoxfs_server`
binary (`second_mount` and `mkfs` keep their own names; they were never the misnamed one), and every
functional reference across the tree (`xtask`'s build and initrd packaging, the kernel's `program()`
lookups and test suites, `script/fmt`, `script/lint`, `script/supply-chain`, the crates and notes
that cross-reference it). `fs_proto` and `kernel/src/user/fs_service.rs` were left untouched as
names, exactly as this section argues they should be; `fs_service.rs` only had its own prose
pointers into the renamed crate corrected. The first stratum (FAT32) can now be named without a
second server carrying a name that disagrees about what kind of thing it is.

### Decided: one process per volume

**calef, 2026-08-18.** Each mounted volume gets its own server process holding exactly one
block-device capability.

Both shapes have one *program* per format, so the installation benefit is the same either way and is
worth stating because it is the strongest of them: **a machine that never mounts FAT32 never installs
`fat32_server`, and the parser is absent rather than confined.** What was decided is how many
*instances* run.

**Why per volume wins, and the deciding argument is not isolation strength.** Per-volume needs no
correctness argument at all. A per-type server holds N block-device capabilities and must get right,
on every request, which volume that request is for; that is the confused-deputy shape a capability
system exists to avoid, and it would have to be argued and tested. Per volume there is only ever one,
so the mistake is **unrepresentable rather than unlikely**, which is rung one of the ladder against a
test.

What it also buys: two USB sticks cannot reach each other, where per-type would put a hostile stick
and an innocent one in one address space. A panic takes down one mount. Unmounting is destroying one
region, which is `Untyped::DESTROY` doing what it already does. And `caps` names exactly one volume,
which is the tightest statement available of what a process may touch.

**The cost, stated plainly:** a process per mount, its memory and its supervision entry. Milestone
129's `--mem` work is already pricing that, and this workload barely feels it, because a home backup
server mounts one volume permanently and a stick occasionally. **The arithmetic changes on a machine
with twenty volumes**, and if that machine ever exists this decision should be re-taken rather than
inherited.

`second_mount` shows the shape already runs: a second FS-server process against the same block
server.

## ext2 is also the controlled experiment, and that may be worth more than the interop

**calef, 2026-08-19**, thinking ahead to the ext2 stratum: benchmark Linux-on-ext2 against
nife-on-ext2 and against nife-on-RedoxFS, when ext2 exists.

**Every filesystem comparison this project has published is uncontrolled.** `notes/benchmarks.md`
measures nife-on-RedoxFS against Linux-on-ext4, and **two things differ at once**: the operating
system's architecture and the filesystem. A gap can be attributed to either, which is why milestone
138's answer to *"does this architecture have a disk-read liability that cannot be overcome"* has to
be assembled from decomposition (the block server is at parity, the residual is 13 us, the rest is
implementation) rather than read off a single number.

**ext2 on both sides holds the filesystem constant.** What remains is the architecture, and nothing
else. That is the experiment the thesis actually wants, and it is a reason to build ext2 that has
nothing to do with mounting a stranger's drive:

| | Linux | nife |
|---|---|---|
| ext4 | measured | not planned |
| **ext2** | **wanted** | **wanted** |
| RedoxFS | not possible | measured |

The diagonal we have today compares two things at once. **The ext2 row isolates the operating system;
the nife column isolates the filesystem.**

**The honest caveats, which must travel with any number this produces**, because a controlled
experiment reported carelessly is worse than an uncontrolled one reported honestly:

- **Our ext2 would be new and Linux's is thirty years old.** A gap is then implementation maturity as
  much as architecture, and saying otherwise would be the overclaim this tree's benchmark discipline
  exists to prevent. The comparison is strongest as a *ceiling* on how much the architecture can
  cost, not as a verdict on it.
- **Measure after milestone 138's steps land, not before.** A young ext2 without the multi-page
  transfer, measured against a mature ext2 that has it, prices our implementation's youth rather than
  anything structural.
- **ext2 has no journal**, so an ext2-versus-ext4 write comparison is not apples-to-apples and never
  will be. ext2 against ext2 is, which is the whole point.
- The existing discipline applies unchanged: same machine model, same device, same tier, same
  transfer sizes, and the noise control `notes/benchmarks.md` already uses.

**This does not reorder the strata.** FAT32 is still first, because a USB stick is what a person meets
and because interop was the requirement that minted this block. It does mean the ext2 lane should
budget for a benchmark rather than treating one as optional.

## What each one has to answer

Recorded here so a later lane does not rediscover them per filesystem:

- **Where does a mounted volume appear?** Milestone 47 gave this system absolute paths rooted in the
  caller's own namespace, and §50's `bind` is the shape a second volume would arrive through. A
  mount that becomes ambient is the one outcome this system exists to refuse.
- **What does a read-only mount cost in authority?** A FAT32 stick is attacker-supplied bytes from
  an unknown machine, which is `notes/untrusted-input-audit.md`'s surface with a much larger parser
  behind it.
- **What is the crash-consistency claim per filesystem?** The injector that produced RedoxFS's
  numbers is in the tree and any candidate can be run against it. **A filesystem this system writes
  to needs a measured answer, not an inherited reputation.** FAT32 has no journal and never claimed
  one; that is tolerable on a stick and disqualifying on a backup, and the difference should be
  written where a user meets it rather than assumed.

## BUGS

- **This block names five filesystems and prices none of them.** The ordering is calef's judgement
  about need, not an estimate of effort, and the effort is not known: a read-only FAT32 is small, a
  writable ext4 is not, and ZFS is a different category of undertaking that may never be right to
  own rather than vendor.
- **Nothing here says whether a foreign filesystem is vendored or written.** §46 governs it and the
  answer plausibly differs per filesystem, which is exactly the kind of thing this block should not
  decide in advance of the first one.
- **The seam argument is a prediction.** "Build two and the abstraction falls out" is the tree's
  stated preference and the usual outcome; it is not guaranteed, and a lane that finds FAT32 and
  RedoxFS share nothing worth abstracting should say so rather than manufacturing a trait.
