# 526. A riscv64 host that hands this kernel ACPI instead of a device tree

*(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)* Promoted from the proposal `a-riscv64-host-that-hands-us-acpi`, filed 2026-09-20, on calef's instruction of 2026-09-20 to give every proposal on `main` a number. The text below is the proposal's own, unedited except for this paragraph: the argument is its author's and promotion is not the moment to improve it. Filed by `maintainer/riscv-summit-research` from the RISC-V Summit
Europe 2026 reading (`notes/riscv-summit-2026.md`). *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands
it; the slug is provisional too, like every name a lane mints.)*

Nothing has to be bought, rented or decided first. QEMU's `riscv64` `virt` machine
already generates the tables: its manual documents an `acpi` machine option and says *"When this
option is 'on' (which is the default), ACPI tables are generated and exposed as firmware tables
etc/acpi/rsdp and etc/acpi/tables"*
(https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/riscv/virt.html, read 2026-09-20). So the whole of this is
testable on the development Mac today.

## The premise, and where it comes from

**The RISC-V Server Platform specification reached 1.0 and is ratified.** Verified away from the
talk: `riscv-non-isa/riscv-server-platform` tag `v1.0`, published `2026-05-06T20:48:48Z`, release
note *"First ratified release."*
(https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-server-platform/releases/tag/v1.0). Radim Krčmář's Bologna
deck carries **"Ratified May 2026"** on its task-group slide
(https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2026/presentations#P-SPMRUA).

The content slide lists what a conforming platform must present, and two of the entries are the
point of this proposal: **BRS-I 1.0, spelled out as UEFI and ACPI**, and **IOMMU**. The stated goal
is that *"OS and hypervisor developers [can] target a single portable binary."*

**This kernel cannot boot that machine.** Every riscv64 entry path in this tree is device-tree:
`notes/visionfive2.md` records the contract as *"entered in S-mode with OpenSBI behind the SBI
calls, `a0` = boot hart id, `a1` = device-tree pointer"*, and `kernel/src/arch/riscv64/` reads a DTB
for the harts, the PLIC, the UART and the timebase. ACPI in this tree is an x86_64 path
(`kernel/src/memory.rs`, `kernel/src/smp.rs`, `kernel/src/pci.rs`), reached through
milestone 322 (one machine matrix for three architectures).

## Why it is worth a milestone rather than a `BUGS` line

Three reasons, in the order this project ranks things.

1. **It is the only thing at that summit that lands directly on a port item.** Everything else in
   the note is context or absence. This one says: the first riscv64 machine anybody rents as a
   *server* will describe itself the way an ARM server does, and this kernel will not understand it.
2. **It is on the rented-capacity path.** Milestone 88 (nife on rented silicon) and
   milestone 89 (Scaleway EM-RV1: a second RISC-V implementation, rented) are both gated on hardware
   calef has to provide, and the RV1's TH1520 is a pre-RVA23 embedded part that boots from a device tree, so it
   does **not** exercise this. The machine that will is the one Asanović said the ecosystem still
   lacks (*"Need large-scale deployments, cloud instances to support devs"*, State of the Union
   slide 5), which means the port should be done *before* the box exists rather than in the hour it
   is rented.
3. **milestone 322's seam is the reason this is cheap.** The machine matrix already exists and
   already has an ACPI consumer. This is a second producer behind an existing seam, not a new
   subsystem, and DECISIONS §19 (architectural parity is a tenet) is what makes "x86_64 can and
   riscv64 cannot" a gap rather than a preference.

## What the work is

Deliberately small, and it ends with a transcript rather than a design:

- Boot `qemu-system-riscv64 -M virt` with ACPI on and read RSDP, RSDT/XSDT and MADT through the
  existing x86_64 parsing, confirming what riscv64's ACPI actually offers (RINTC entries for harts,
  where the IMSIC/APLIC live, whether PCIe ECAM comes from MCFG rather than from the DTB).
- Decide the precedence rule and write it down: a machine may present **both** a DTB and ACPI, and
  the kernel has to say which it believes and why. That choice belongs in the block, not here.
- Make the riscv64 tour boot both ways, DTB and ACPI, from the same binary, and record both
  transcripts.

**What would falsify the proposal.** If QEMU's riscv64 ACPI tables turn out to describe a machine so
close to the DTB's that the kernel learns nothing new, this shrinks to a scope note under milestone
322 and should be closed as such. That is a cheap thing to find out and it is the first step above.

## What is explicitly not in scope

**UEFI.** BRS-I names UEFI beside ACPI and this tree has a `uefi_loader`, but booting riscv64 under
EDK2 is a second piece of work with its own firmware problem, and milestone 88's block already
carries a UEFI stage. Doing ACPI alone keeps this to one thing.

**The IOMMU line on the same slide.** That is milestone 143 (silicon IOMMU: carrying 16b's driver to
a board that ships the ratified spec), which is hardware-gated and stays there; `notes/riscv-summit-2026.md`
records that nothing at the summit moved it.
