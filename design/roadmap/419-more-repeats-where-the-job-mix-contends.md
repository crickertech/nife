# 419. `tasks=4` needs more repeats, not more power cycles, and `REPEATS` is one constant for the whole sweep

**Status: BUILT** 2026-09-19, by milestone 168's own lane, in a different session and on the same
day this block was numbered and its decision written up. What landed is **options 1 and 3 together**
from the list below: a uniform `REPEATS` of 21 for the whole sweep, and the median reported with the
minimum and maximum beside it. **Option 2, a per-point table, was refused on measured board time**:
at 21 repeats the timed windows are a small share of a boot, so varying the count per point buys
nothing it costs. Promoted from the proposal `more-repeats-where-the-job-mix-contends`, filed
2026-09-16 by the maintainer from the five-boot job-mix session on radon, where the fourth and fifth
boots each landed outside the range the first three had established. *(Number provisional until the
merge queue lands it.)*

**Its `DECISION` gate was answered by a build rather than by calef, and that is worth saying
plainly.** The gate was right: `job_mix::REPEATS` decides how long every bench evening takes on
every board, and the `job-mix-repeat:` line is output that two programs read (`script/job-mix`'s
rehearsal and `crates/board_console`'s recogniser). The lane that built it had the change assigned
in its maintainer's brief, noted that both readers are in-tree, and recorded the choice in milestone
168 so it is visible rather than implied. So the question **is** settled in the tree, and it was not
settled by the person whose call it was.
[§191](../decisions/191-job-mix-repeats-and-what-the-line-reports.md) stays `PROPOSED` for exactly
that reason: it is now a ratification or an overrule rather than an open fork, and the difference
between those two is not a lane's to erase.

*(Updated 2026-09-26.)* calef ratified what shipped on 2026-09-26 (about 01:30 UTC): *"Yes, ratify
§191 as shipped."* §191 (whether the job mix reports the spread rather than the best) is `DECIDED`, so the paragraph above describes a question that is now
closed, and it was closed by the person whose call it was.

**Premise re-checked 2026-09-19 and still true.** *(That check predates commit `ab6ff0fa0` the
same day; `REPEATS` has been 21 since, at `crates/job_mix/src/lib.rs:465`.)* `job_mix::REPEATS` is still `3`, one constant for
the whole sweep, and milestone 168 is still `PARTIAL` for the reason this block names: its status
line says it does not turn `BUILT` until `tasks=4` has a number, and it still does not have one. The
interim this block recommends, option 4, is what 168's block now does.

**In brief.** Milestone 168's sweep reports the **best of three** repeats per sweep point. At
`tasks=4` the underlying distribution is wide enough that the best of three is itself a coin flip:
across five boots of an identical image the reported figure ranged from 766,361 to 991,671 jobs per
minute, a 29.4% spread, while boot 3's three repeats *on their own* spanned 132,148 to 181,408
ticks, which contains the whole boot-to-boot range. The variance is within a boot, so power cycling
does not reduce it.

`tasks=4` is where `job_mix::ECHO_SERVERS = 2` first produces contention (2:1) with too few samples
to average it. That contention is deliberate and correct; what is missing is enough samples at the
point it bites.

## Why it is a decision rather than a patch

**The cost is not symmetric across sweep points.** `tasks=32` already takes about 930,000 ticks per
repeat and is stable at 2.7%; tripling its repeats buys nothing and lengthens every board session
noticeably. `tasks=4` takes about 150,000 ticks and is the one that needs them. So the obvious fix
is not "raise `REPEATS`" but "vary repeats by sweep point", and that turns one constant into a
table, which is a different thing for a reader to hold and for `board_console` to recognise.

**And a wide distribution may not want a minimum at all.** `REPEATS`' doc states the rule this tree
uses: the minimum is the least host-contended sample and everything above it is somebody else's
load. That reasoning is sound for a micro-benchmark on a busy host. It is questionable for a
workload whose *whole subject* is contention between its own tasks: there, the spread is the signal
rather than noise to be minimised away, and reporting only the best discards it.

## The options

1. **Raise `REPEATS` uniformly**, to 5 or 7. Simplest, one constant, no format change. Costs the
   most board time, and spends it mostly where it is not needed.
2. **A per-sweep-point repeat table.** Cheap in board time and targets the problem. Costs a
   constant becoming a table, and `board_console`'s recogniser has to stop assuming a fixed count.
3. **Keep three repeats and report the spread rather than the best**, so the line carries min, max
   and median. No extra board time at all, and it makes the instability visible rather than
   averaged away, which is arguably what a multi-tasking benchmark should publish. Costs a wire
   format change to the `job-mix:` line, which is the most expensive thing on this list by
   AGENTS.md's *move fast on what can be undone* test.
4. **Do nothing and record `tasks=4` as a range.** Free, honest, and leaves milestone 168 `PARTIAL`
   for a reason nobody can close without one of the above.

**Recommendation: 3, with 4 as the interim**, and the reason is the one this proposal opened with.
The job mix exists to measure what contention costs; a report that keeps only the least-contended
sample is answering a different question than the one §96 asked. But option 3 changes a line two
programs read, so it is calef's rather than a lane's, and until it is decided the honest thing is
option 4, which is what milestone 168's block now does.

**Blocked until it is answered:** milestone 168 turning `BUILT`. Its own status line says it does
not, until a number exists, and `tasks=4` does not yet have one.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 168.** Where the work landed: *"What changed on 2026-09-19"*, with the resampling
  evidence for 21 and the old-and-new line formats in `notes/job-mix.md`.
- **Decision.** [`design/decisions/191-job-mix-repeats-and-what-the-line-reports.md`](../decisions/191-job-mix-repeats-and-what-the-line-reports.md),
  still `PROPOSED`, and now asking calef to ratify or overrule what shipped rather than to choose
  from four options.
- **Refused.** *Option 2, a per-point repeat table.* Refused on measured board time rather than on
  taste: the proposal assumed board time was the cost and it is not.
- **Recorded.** *Every `job-mix:` line produced before 2026-09-19 is incomparable to one after it*,
  because the line gained `repeats=`, `ticks_min=`, `ticks_median=` and `ticks_max=` and the
  statistic changed from best-of-three to median-of-21. Recorded in milestone 168 and in
  `notes/job-mix.md`, which carries the old-and-new table.

## Index row

**Built:** 2026-09-19

Milestone 168's sweep reports the best of three repeats per sweep point, and at `tasks=4` the
underlying distribution is wide enough that the best of three is itself a coin flip: five boots of
an identical image ranged from 766,361 to 991,671 jobs per minute, a 29.4% spread, while one boot's
three repeats on their own spanned a range containing the whole boot-to-boot spread. The variance is
within a boot, so power cycling does not reduce it. `tasks=4` is where `ECHO_SERVERS = 2` first
produces contention with too few samples to average it, and `tasks=32` is already stable at 2.7% and
would pay for repeats it does not need, so the obvious fix turns one constant into a table that
`board_console`'s recogniser has to stop assuming is fixed. The recommendation is to report the
spread rather than the best, because a benchmark whose subject is contention should not keep only
the least-contended sample, and that changes a line two programs read, which makes it calef's.
