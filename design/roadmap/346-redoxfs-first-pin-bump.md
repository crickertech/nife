# 346. The first RedoxFS pin bump, on the engine that holds backups

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Filed 2026-09-03 as an unnumbered proposal by the milestone 247 sweep,
from milestone 203's block; numbered 2026-09-19 by milestone 433. **Premise re-checked 2026-09-19 and
it holds.** `vendor/README.md` still pins RedoxFS at 0.9.1, upstream git sha
`473b4baeb041ebe14504f30693393b1cae52558c`, and still lists the five divergences in the same order
with divergence 3 kept rather than reverted. Nobody has performed a bump; the "Bumping a pin"
procedure has still never been executed. How far upstream has moved since the 37 non-merge commits
`script/vendor-watch` reported cannot be re-measured without network, so whoever takes this re-runs
the watch rather than quoting that number.

**Gate: NONE.** Everything this needs exists: the pinned sha, the five recorded divergences,
`script/vendor-verify --write-patch`, the suite, and milestone 37's crash injector. One clause is
calef's if it comes up, and it is named below rather than blocking the start.

**In brief.** `script/vendor-watch`'s first run found upstream RedoxFS **37 non-merge commits ahead
of the pinned sha**, including `fix: do not hardcode # of sectors per block`, with 0.9.1 still the
newest published version. Bumping the pin means raising it, re-applying the five divergences,
regenerating the patch with `script/vendor-verify --write-patch`, and re-running the suite plus
milestone 37's crash injector. Nobody has ever performed this job in this tree, which is the second
reason to do it: the procedure in `vendor/README.md`'s "Bumping a pin" section has never been
executed.

## Why this matters

This is the case milestone 203 was built to catch, and it was live on the day the watch was built. A
correctness fix is sitting on upstream master and will not appear in a published version on any
schedule anyone here controls. The pinned engine is the one holding a filesystem, and the whole
argument for vendoring rather than writing it (§46: vendor where correctness is won by exposure) is
that upstream's exposure accrues to us. It only accrues if somebody moves the pin.

There is a second cost that grows on its own. The five divergences are re-applied by hand at every
bump, and three of them are re-applied forever. The further the pin drifts behind, the more upstream
restructuring those three have to survive at once, and `vendor/README.md` is already honest that if
upstream restructures the code they touch they may not be re-applicable at all. Thirty-seven commits
is the cheapest this job will ever be.

## The clause that is an architect's, if it fires

Divergence 3 is kept rather than reverted only because reverting it is an architect's call. A bump is where
the five get re-litigated. If a divergence will not re-apply, the honest outcome is a decision
(rewrite it, stay on the pin and record why, or fork permanently) rather than a forced patch, and
that is where a lane stops and writes it up.

## Where it came from

Milestone 203 (nothing will ever tell us RedoxFS moved) built the detection half and said plainly
that acting on the finding was a bump lane's job, not that milestone's. Its own follow-on named the
work: *"Perform the first real RedoxFS pin bump. [...] Nobody owns it, and this is the engine
holding backups."*

## Index row

`script/vendor-watch`'s first run found upstream RedoxFS 37 non-merge commits ahead of the pinned
sha, including `fix: do not hardcode # of sectors per block`, with 0.9.1 still the newest published
version. This is the case milestone 203 was built to catch, live on the day the watch was built: a
correctness fix sitting on upstream master that will not appear in a published version on any
schedule anyone here controls, on the pinned engine that holds a filesystem. DECISIONS §46's whole
argument for vendoring rather than writing it is that upstream's exposure accrues to us, and it only
accrues if somebody moves the pin. The second cost grows on its own, because the five divergences are
re-applied by hand at every bump and three of them are re-applied forever: the further the pin
drifts, the more upstream restructuring those three have to survive at once, and `vendor/README.md`
is already honest that they may stop being re-applicable at all. Nobody has ever performed this job
in this tree, which is the second reason to do it. If a divergence will not re-apply, the honest
outcome is a decision rather than a forced patch, and that is where a lane stops.
