# 19. Run a real workload

**Status: BUILT.**

**In brief.** A native-ABI workload first; Linux-compat or VM hosting later

**Why it matters.** **the "runs real workloads" half** of the thesis. **Built:** granular verbs and userspace init (19d), init as the real boot path (19d.2c), dedicated binaries delivered as a nifefs archive with a shared `user_rt` runtime (19f.1-6), the native ABI written down (19e/Decision 2, notes/abi.md, DECISIONS §15), and the first real workload, a CoreMark-derived compute program spawned against that ABI (19e). design/init-and-granular-spawn.md

**Deliverable.** The "runs real workloads" half of §14: a real, unverified program running in
confined userspace on the verified core. A **native-ABI** workload first (the leanest thing that
proves the point), with a Linux-compat personality or VM hosting as later, larger options.

**Why.** The thesis is not "a verified kernel" but "a verified kernel *that runs real workloads*."
This is the milestone that makes the second half true, and it is what a demonstrator ultimately shows.

**The sub-decision it carries.** What counts as the first "real workload," and by which ABI. Native
first keeps the kernel pure and the surface small. A Linux-compat personality (Starnix / gVisor /
WSL1 shape, a userspace server translating syscalls) is how a demonstrator eventually reaches
existing software, and it is where the parked competitor ambition would begin. VM hosting (seL4's
route) needs the EL2 work in design/driver-domains.md. Decide the first target before writing
compat code, so it stays scoped.

## Follow-on

- **Decision.** `design/decisions/15-native-abi.md` holds the sub-decision this block carried: what
  counts as the first real workload, and by which ABI. calef chose the native ABI, with a
  CoreMark-derived compute program against it, and explicitly not Linux-compat.
- **Recorded.** `design/decisions/10-capability-microkernel.md` is where the Linux-compat
  personality sits, neither refused nor scheduled. A POSIX shim is *additive*, built on capability
  handles the way Fuchsia's `fdio` is, so nothing built now is thrown away by taking it later.
- **Recorded.** `design/driver-domains.md` holds the EL2 shape that VM hosting, seL4's route and the
  third option this block named, would need. This kernel has no EL2 work and nothing has been built
  against that page.
