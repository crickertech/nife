# 248. A placement can only be drawn, never constructed, so the strongest finding on this machine rests on two boots

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Minted 2026-09-03 by calef, from milestone 240's (the soak reports what
happened and not where, so an eightfold difference cannot be explained) handoff and the two censused
boots that followed it. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**Gate: NONE.** Milestone 240 is merged and already knows where every worker is.

**In brief.** On 2026-09-03 the soak on radon produced a **fifteenfold** throughput spread from one
card and one build, and milestone 240's census explained it. The explanation makes a count the
predictor:

| | IPC groups sharing a core with a grinder | rate |
|---|---|---|
| the fast boot | 1 of 4 | **342,447/s** |
| the slow boot | 4 of 4 | **23,254/s** |

A grinder is pure compute and never yields, so a group co-located with one waits for its timeslice on
every exchange. The boot lottery decides how many of the four groups draw one.

**The evidence is stronger than two points usually are and it is still two points.** The slow
arrangement was *predicted in writing before it was seen*, in notes/soak.md, along with the
observation that would have killed the reading (grinders found piled on one core at 23,000/s). It was
not killed. But a confirmed prediction over one fast boot and one slow boot is not a controlled
result, and **nothing in this tree can construct an arrangement** to make it one: placement is drawn
at spawn and nothing rebalances.

## What this is not, and the distinction is the whole design

**This is not thread affinity, and conflating the two would buy a syscall this project has not
decided it wants.** A syscall surface is one of the expensive, irreversible categories (DECISIONS
§10, §16, and AGENTS.md's *move fast on what can be undone*): every future program is written against
it, and a placement primitive is exactly the kind of thing that looks obvious in the moment and
constrains the scheduler forever.

What this milestone needs is a **test lever in the soak build**, behind the same
`#[cfg(feature = "soak")]` that milestone 240's census already sits behind, costing the shipped
kernel nothing. The soak already knows it is building four groups of a responder, three callers and a
grinder; letting it say *where* is a change to a workload, not to an interface.

**Whether the real thing is worth its surface is precisely the question this milestone exists to help
answer**, and answering it before running the experiment would be deciding the expensive thing on the
strength of two boots. That is the wrong order.

## The experiment this buys

One soak run per arrangement, with the count above as the independent variable:

- 0 of 4 groups sharing with a grinder (all four grinders on one core)
- 1, 2, 3 of 4
- 4 of 4, which is the slow boot

If rate falls monotonically with the count, the mechanism is confirmed under control rather than
inferred from a lottery. If it does not, something else is going on and the two-boot reading was
luck wearing a mechanism's clothes.

**Five drawn boots the same evening replaced the variable this milestone thought it was testing, and
the replacement is the thing to build against.** The block above states the predictor as the number of
IPC groups sharing a core with a grinder. **That is wrong**, and a fifth boot said so: a 2-of-4
arrangement came in at **346,492/s**, faster than two separate 1-of-4 arrangements at 342,447/s and
342,379/s. A count that runs the wrong way is not the predictor.

Re-read against a different variable, all five boots fall into three tight levels. **Count the cores
that are free of grinders and carrying an IPC group:**

| grinder-free cores carrying a group | rate |
|---|---|
| **2** | 342,447/s, 342,379/s, 346,492/s |
| **1** | 184,001/s |
| **0** | 23,254/s |

Within a level the spread is under 1.2%; between levels it is roughly proportional, with a different
regime at zero. The group-level count was a proxy that tracked this until an arrangement separated
them.

**And it is a better mechanism rather than only a better fit.** The question is not whether a
particular group drew a grinder; it is how much grinder-free CPU the IPC workload has to run on. Two
clean cores serve four groups nearly as well as they serve three, because the groups block constantly
and share a core willingly. One clean core is half the machine. Zero means every exchange waits behind
something that never yields, which is why that row is a cliff rather than the next step of a trend.

**What the experiment has to do differently, now that the variable has changed once already:**

- **Sweep clean cores from 0 to 4**, which is the independent variable, rather than sweeping the
  co-location count.
- **Run several unlike arrangements at each level**, because the whole reason the first model survived
  four boots is that no arrangement had yet separated it from the truth. Agreement across unlike
  arrangements at one level is the evidence; a single run per level cannot produce it.
- **The 3 and 4 clean-core rows have never been drawn at all.** The lottery has produced only 0, 1 and
  2 in five boots, so the top of the curve is entirely unmeasured and only a constructed run can reach
  it.

**The honest reading of all this is that a drawn sample kept producing a plausible model and then
overturning it**, twice in one evening: a crossing-rate correlate died when a second slow boot
disagreed, and the co-location count died when a 2-of-4 outran a 1-of-4. That is the argument for this
milestone, restated by events. notes/soak.md carries both corrections.
2026-09-03 run, so this is minutes per arrangement rather than an evening each.

## The proof that this milestone worked

**A table of rate against the co-location count, every row from a constructed arrangement rather than
a drawn one**, in notes/soak.md beside the two boots that motivated it.

Not a mechanism for setting placement with no measurement made through it, which would be the lever
mistaken for the finding.

## BUGS

- **It measures this workload, not the scheduler.** Four groups and four grinders is a synthetic
  shape chosen for milestone 219; a real system's mix is not that, and the fifteenfold figure should
  not be carried over to one that is not.
- **A constructed placement is not a placement the system would choose**, so this answers "what does
  co-location cost" and never "how often does it happen." The lottery's distribution is still only
  knowable by sampling boots.
- **Nothing here fixes the problem it measures.** If co-location costs an order of magnitude, the
  remedy is scheduling policy the kernel does not have, and this block deliberately does not propose
  one: the tree has no notion that two threads communicate, that one never yields, or that one is
  latency-sensitive, and choosing among those is a design fork rather than a follow-on.
- **The lever must not leak into the shipped kernel.** Milestone 240 kept its census behind the soak
  feature and `script/fastpath-footprint` read the same 6,687 bytes over eight symbols afterwards;
  the same evidence is owed here.
