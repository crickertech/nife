# 164. x86_64 userspace can't build `aes` (and therefore `fs_server`): no SSE, no scalar fallback

**Status: BUILT 2026-09-01.** Minted 2026-08-25 from milestone 161's x86_64 userspace lane (pull
request #476), which named the `aes` failure plainly as "the finding that is not our bug" and
proposed it as its own milestone rather than routing around it. It was minted **Gate: NONE**, on
the grounds that this was a toolchain and dependency problem rather than a hardware one, and that
held: a lane made the whole of it without a board.

**The title is now a statement about the past.** x86_64 userspace builds `aes`, `redoxfs_server`
and `mkfs`, and the x86_64 archive carries the last two. Both routes this block sized are
superseded and neither was taken; the section below says why, and is kept rather than deleted
because the sizing was wrong in an instructive direction.

## What it turned out to need: one build flag

`aes` 0.8.4 selects its backend in `src/lib.rs` with `cfg_if`, and **every architecture-specific
arm is gated `not(aes_force_soft)`**. The crate ships a portable constant-time software backend in
`src/soft/`, reachable by setting that cfg. Measured against this tree's own FS-server build
command, on `x86_64-unknown-none`:

```
(no flag)              exit 101, rustc-LLVM ERROR: Do not know how to split the result of this operator!
--cfg aes_force_soft   exit 0, redoxfs_server and mkfs both linked
```

That is this block's exact error, reproduced and then cleared. The flag lives in
`.cargo/config.toml`'s `[target.x86_64-unknown-none]` block, beside the `relocation-model=static`
the kernel needs.

**It is on the target rather than on the one package that needs it, and the coupling was noticed
rather than inherited.** This block's own "fact worth knowing" is correct: `x86_64-unknown-none` is
the *same* target the kernel builds under, so a `rustflags` entry there reaches the kernel too.
Cargo has no way to ADD a flag (`RUSTFLAGS` and `--config target.*.rustflags` both REPLACE the
list), so scoping the cfg to `redoxfs_server_build` would have meant restating
`relocation-model=static` in `xtask/src/main.rs`, away from the paragraph explaining why the kernel
needs it. One copy in one place, with the cost written down where a reader meets it: every crate on
this target gets the cfg, and it is inert in all of them but `aes`, which is the only thing in this
tree or its dependency graph that reads the name. `cargo clippy` at the bars `script/lint` already
sets passes for the kernel, for `bench`, and for `user` + `user_rt` with it on.

## Why both sized routes are superseded

**Route 1 (patch the vendored `aes` for a scalar fallback) is unnecessary**, and `patches/` does not
grow a third entry. This block named the right next step ("is it a feature flag this tree isn't
enabling, or a genuine gap in the crate's own portable path") and it took five minutes to answer:
the portable path is not a gap, it is a cfg nobody had set.

**Route 2 (an SSE-enabled x86 userspace target) is not owed for this blocker**, and its sizing was
the accurate half of this block: `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/` saves and restores no FPU/SSE state
anywhere, so enabling SSE would mean an `FXSAVE` area per thread and save/restore in the
context-switch path. None of that was built, because none of it is needed to compile `aes`.

**The honest cost of not taking Route 2 is speed, and this block should not let a reader assume
parity.** The software backend is a bitsliced constant-time implementation; upstream RustCrypto's
own figures put AES-NI roughly an order of magnitude ahead of it. **Unmeasured here**, and
deliberately so: nothing on x86_64 mounts an encrypted RedoxFS volume yet, so there is no workload
to measure and a synthetic number would be a fact leaving the machine with nothing behind it. When
an x86_64 workload touches the crypto path, that is when the number is owed, and Route 2 is what it
would be weighed against.

## What it delivered, measured

`script/test --arch x86_64`, before and after, on the same tree:

| | passed | skipped |
|---|---|---|
| before | 200 | 55 |
| after | 211 | 44 |

**Zero tests were recovered, and reading that table as though eleven were is the mistake this
paragraph exists to prevent.** All eleven that moved do not skip through `skip!` at all: they
`println!` a line and `return`, which the harness counts as a pass. They were honestly skipped for
want of an FS server and are now silently green for want of a disk, which is *less* signal than
before. Forty-six sites across sixteen files share that shape; see milestone 214 (provisional), on tests that print a skip line and return.

What did change, and is real: the FS server and `mkfs` are in the x86_64 archive, so **the reason
those tests do not run is now a machine fact rather than a toolchain one**, which is what the next
milestone can act on. `kernel::user::disk_tests::the_write_half_...` now skips with "no blank-disk
fixture attached" instead of blaming `aes`, and the two `fs_service` constants that stated the old
blocker as fact have been corrected: they claimed `aes` does not compile for this target, which is
exactly what stopped being true.

## What broke after `aes`, and what it costs

**The disk.** With the server packed, `fs_service::wire_servers` still asks
`virtio::find_block_device_n(1)` for its disk, and `q35` has no virtio-mmio bus at all
(`arch::x86_64::mmu::VIRTIO_SLOTS` is 0). Attaching the fixtures as `virtio-blk-pci` and making the
lookup transport-blind was built in this lane, run, and **reverted**, because it does not work and
the reason is structural rather than a bug:

- `qemu-system-x86_64: Interrupt Mask set, irq is not generated`
- `qemu-system-x86_64: vtd_iommu_translate: detected translation failure (dev=00:04:00, iova=0xffde000)`
- the suite then wedged with no verdict.

The first line is the whole story and it is already written down in the tree, at
`arch::x86_64::mmu::PCI_IRQ_BASE`, which is `0` and says honestly that it is a marker rather than a
value. `pci::intx_irq(0, 4, 1)` is therefore `0`, and `arch::x86_64::irq::enable(0)` resolves that
through `isa_routing` to the **PIT's** legacy line: the confined block server was armed on the
timer and waited forever for an interrupt that was never going to be its. Nothing about that is
specific to the FS server; it is the first userspace PCI driver this architecture has ever been
asked to run. See milestone 213 (provisional), on x86_64 PCI interrupt routing.

## What this unblocks

**Milestone 87** (x86_64 on the Dell OptiPlex) is the one that matters, and this moves it by
removing the toolchain wall and leaving a machine wall in its place. When calef sits down at the
null modem, the archive that boots carries a real filesystem server rather than nothing above the
kernel; what it still cannot do is find a disk, and that is one bounded piece of interrupt routing
rather than an open-ended port.

Any future x86_64 work needing `fs_server` is likewise no longer blocked on a dependency that will
not compile, which is what fatal risk 9 (`design/fatal-risks.md`, "The HAL is a fiction, and an
architecture costs a restructure rather than a port") named this as a piece of.

## BUGS

- **`mkfs` is packed but has nothing to format on this architecture.** Milestone 57's two
  `disk_service` wirings want the GPT and blank fixtures, which no x86_64 runner attaches; those
  tests skip with an accurate reason and no plan of their own. They ride milestone 213, on x86_64 PCI interrupt routing.
- **The soft-AES cost is unmeasured**, above.
