# 239. radon's device tree does not describe the TRNG, so a working driver never runs

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Minted 2026-09-03 by calef, from the first bench session that ran milestone
159's (a real hardware entropy source: the JH7110's TRNG) driver on the board it was written for.
**The premise in that title is false and the title is kept anyway**, because milestone 241 (what a
fourth board would have to be for, so that GICv3 is bought rather than justified) cites this
milestone by that name and a lane does not edit another milestone's block. Read the title as the
diagnosis this work was minted on; the section below is what it turned out to be. The token follows
milestone 218's (every boot of the VisionFive 2 needs a human typing four commands into U-Boot)
precedent exactly: **a route was taken on 2026-09-03 and radon was powered off, so the status says
what the outcome is rather than what was built.**

**Gate: HARDWARE.** Everything that does not need the board is built, host-tested and merged; what
remains is two commands at a U-Boot prompt and one boot, and QEMU cannot stand in, because the
`virt` machine has no JH7110 anything.

**In brief, and the brief is a correction.** radon booted nife hands-free on 2026-09-03 (milestone
218) and the tour reported:

```
hw entropy  : skipped (this machine's tree describes no starfive,jh7110-trng; QEMU virt has none)
```

The line was true. The conclusion drawn from it, that the tree omits the device, was not. **The tree
radon hands us does describe the TRNG. It describes it under a different node name and a different
`compatible` string, and calls it disabled.**

## What it actually is

`fdt addr ${fdtcontroladdr}` hands nife the vendor U-Boot's own control device tree: U-Boot 2021.10,
`Build: jenkins-VF2_515_Branch_SDK_Release-24`, dated `Feb 12 2023`, from the board's own banner in
`crates/board_console/tests/fixtures/captured/vf2-2026-09-01-manual-boot.log`. That tree is compiled
from `arch/riscv/dts/jh7110.dtsi` in StarFive's U-Boot fork, and that file says:

```
trng: trng@1600C000 {
	compatible = "starfive,trng";
	reg = <0x0 0x1600C000 0x0 0x4000>;
	clocks = <&clkgen JH7110_SEC_HCLK>,
		 <&clkgen JH7110_SEC_MISCAHB_CLK>;
	clock-names = "hclk", "miscahb_clk";
	resets = <&rstgen RSTN_U0_SEC_TOP_HRESETN>;
	interrupts = <30>;
	status = "disabled";
};
```

Read at commit `bfbdce9b86a2` (2023-01-06), the last change to that file before the flashed
firmware's build date, and unchanged at that branch's head:
<https://github.com/starfive-tech/u-boot/blob/bfbdce9b86a2/arch/riscv/dts/jh7110.dtsi>. Mainline
Linux spells the same device `rng@1600c000`, `compatible = "starfive,jh7110-trng"`, and that is what
`crates/jh7110_trng` was written against.

**Every observation from the bench holds, and none of them meant what it was read to mean.**

| What was seen on 2026-09-03 | What it was read as | What it was |
|---|---|---|
| `fdt print /soc/rng@1600c000` -> `FDT_ERR_NOTFOUND` | no such device in the tree | no such **path**: the node is `trng`, not `rng`, and its unit address carries an **upper-case C**, so `/soc/trng@1600c000` misses too |
| `fdt list /soc` -> 56 nodes, no random number generator | the device is absent | `trng@1600C000` is one of the 56; it was not recognised |
| `crypto@16000000` and `sec_dma@16008000` present, their neighbour absent | a specific omission, so a firmware build choice | both are spelled identically in the two trees, so both matched a reader's eye where the third did not |
| `hw entropy : skipped (... describes no starfive,jh7110-trng ...)` | the tree names no TRNG | the tree names no `starfive,jh7110-trng`, which is a narrower claim than the sentence reads as, and it was the exact truth |

**The three shapes of fix this block was minted with are all answers to a question that was not the
question.** Loading a fuller DTB from the card, carrying an overlay, and accepting the vendor tree's
limits all assume a missing node. Nothing is missing.

## Why the vendor tree spells it that way, which decides whether to trust it

`starfive,trng` is not a different device and it is not a different register block. It is a stale
fork, and there are two pieces of evidence rather than an argument:

- **StarFive's own kernel driver had already moved on.** `drivers/char/hw_random/starfive-trng.c` in
  `starfive-tech/linux` matched `starfive,jh7110-trng` at commit `202b558ae34c`, 2022-12-14, two
  months before this firmware was built
  (<https://github.com/starfive-tech/linux/blob/202b558ae34c/drivers/char/hw_random/starfive-trng.c>).
  Its register `#define`s are `CTRL` 0x00, `STAT` 0x04, `MODE` 0x08, `SMODE` 0x0C, `IE` 0x10,
  `ISTAT` 0x14, `RAND0`..`RAND7` 0x20..0x3C, `AUTO_RQSTS` 0x60, `AUTO_AGE` 0x64, with the same
  `CTRL`/`STAT`/`ISTAT` bit positions mainline's `jh7110-trng.c` carries. Two drivers written
  against one IP block agree completely, which is what makes accepting the vendor string a claim
  about a spelling rather than a claim about silicon.
- **Nobody on their side had a reason to notice.** Linux on this board is handed the kernel
  package's own DTB. It never sees U-Boot's, so U-Boot's copy could drift for a year without
  costing StarFive anything. It costs us, because nife takes U-Boot's tree and nothing else.

**And the `status = "disabled"` is U-Boot's, not the board's.** StarFive's Linux enables the
identical node from `jh7110-common.dtsi` (`&trng { status = "okay"; };`), along with `&crypto` and
`&sec_dma`. U-Boot marks it disabled because U-Boot has no driver for it.

## What was built, and the one decision inside it

`crates/jh7110_trng::discover` now tries mainline's `starfive,jh7110-trng` first and the vendor's
`starfive,trng` second, reads every property against the string that matched, and carries two new
facts out: which spelling it was, and what the node's `status` says.

**`status` is reported and not acted on**, which is the decision. Refusing a node the firmware calls
disabled would be correct device-tree semantics and wrong here, and this tree already has the reason
written down in the other direction: the same DTB marks the S7 monitor core `status = "okay"` and
claims it has an Sv39 MMU, and both are false (notes/visionfive2.md, "Second bench stop"). A tree
that lies about `status` in one direction has not earned obedience in the other. So the boot tour's
failure line now carries the tree's own two words (`tree says starfive,trng, status disabled`)
beside the bring-up diagnostic, because those two facts together are what triage needs: an all-zero
register window on a node the firmware calls disabled is a clock or a reset nobody ungated, which is
milestone 220's (a clock and reset controller, because the first real device needs one) territory
rather than a driver bug.

The skip line names both strings now. The old wording was the exact truth and was still read as a
stronger claim than it made, which is a defect in the line rather than in the reader. Observed on a
riscv64 boot under QEMU on 2026-09-03 (`script/soak --arch riscv64`), which is the only machine
available to say it:

```
hw entropy  : skipped (this machine's tree names no TRNG: neither starfive,jh7110-trng nor the vendor U-Boot's starfive,trng; QEMU virt has neither)
```

**The fixture is transcribed, not captured**:
`crates/jh7110_trng/tests/fixtures/jh7110-trng-vendor-uboot.dts`, from the firmware's own source at
the commit above, wrapped in the `/soc` node with the two-cell `#address-cells`/`#size-cells` that
were measured off the board and are already committed in
`crates/machine_discovery/tests/fixtures/visionfive2-uboot-control.dts`. `dtc` warns
`simple-bus unit address format error, expected "1600c000"` when compiling it, which is the
upper-case C being genuinely irregular rather than a transcription slip.

## What is left, and it is a bench session

**Nothing in this milestone has run on radon.** The board was powered off when the work was done and
there was no bench session. Two commands and one boot settle all of it.

1. At the `StarFive #` prompt, with a serial terminal that can type (`screen /dev/cu.usbmodem*
   115200`; `script/board-console` deliberately cannot type):

   ```
   StarFive # fdt addr ${fdtcontroladdr}
   StarFive # fdt print /soc/trng@1600C000
   ```

   **The upper-case C is required** and is the whole reason the first attempt missed. If that path
   is not found, fall back to `fdt list /soc` and read the whole list rather than scanning it for a
   word.

2. Then let the board boot normally (the card's `boot.scr.uimg` needs nothing typed) and read the
   `hw entropy` line, which is the last line of the tour before the banner.

| What comes back | What it means |
|---|---|
| `fdt print` shows the node, `compatible = "starfive,trng"`, `status = "disabled"` | **The finding above is confirmed.** Whatever the `hw entropy` line then says is about the device, not about the tree |
| `hw entropy : JH7110 TRNG at 0x1600c000 served 32+32 bytes ...` | **Milestone 159's line, and fatal risk 6 answered.** Record it whole; the tree question is closed and this block is BUILT |
| `hw entropy : FAILED: ... (tree says starfive,trng, status disabled): ... bring-up diagnostic 0x0000000000000000 ...` | The node was found and the register window read as nothing. The expected outcome if the firmware never ungated the block's clocks or deasserted its reset, which is exactly what `status = "disabled"` predicts. **This routes to milestone 220**, not back here |
| `hw entropy : FAILED: ... bring-up diagnostic 0x<nonzero> ...` | The device answered and the driver's sequence is wrong. Milestone 159's own table decodes the word |
| `hw entropy : skipped (... neither starfive,jh7110-trng nor the vendor U-Boot's starfive,trng ...)` | **The node really is absent from the running firmware's tree**, whatever its source says, and this block's three original shapes of fix come back. Capture the tree (`fdt print` to a file, or the raw dump route notes/visionfive2.md's PLIC fixture used) before deciding anything |
| `fdt print` finds the node but the boot still skips | A discovery bug, not a tree question. The fixture test says the decode works on this shape, so suspect the `/soc` wrapper's cells or a node deeper than `crates/dtb`'s `MAX_DEPTH` of 16 |

## Follow-on

- **Done.** `crates/jh7110_trng::discover` accepts both spellings, carries which one matched and the
  node's `status`, and is host-tested against a fixture transcribed from the firmware's own source.
- **Done.** notes/visionfive2.md's "The TRNG is not in the tree" section carries the correction
  beside the original reading, rather than replacing it, and its "To measure at the bench" item 9
  now asks the question that can actually be answered.
- **Recorded.** Milestone 159's step-4 outcome table still quotes the old skip line
  (`... describes no starfive,jh7110-trng; ...`) and still reads that line as "the board's own
  device tree has no TRNG node". Both are now stale. A lane does not edit another milestone's block,
  so the corrected table is the one above and 159's is superseded by it; the maintainer owns
  reconciling them.
- **Milestone 220.** A clock and reset controller. If the bench run comes back with an all-zero
  bring-up diagnostic, that is not a defect in this milestone or in 159: it is the firmware never
  having ungated a block it calls disabled, and 220 is where it goes. This milestone's work makes
  that outcome distinguishable from "no such device", which it was not before.
- **Refused.** Shipping a fuller DTB from the card, or an overlay, or a `fdt mknode` sequence in the
  boot script. All three were priced and all three lost to a four-line decoder change: they make
  this project the author of a hardware description, they change every discovery input at once on a
  board nobody can currently test, and the boot-script route additionally depends on the vendor
  U-Boot's `fdt` subcommands and on a node path with an upper-case C in it. The one thing they would
  buy over the decoder change is flipping `status` to `okay`, and that buys nothing: U-Boot has no
  driver for this block either way, so no `fdt set` ungates a clock.
- **None.** No further work on the device-tree source itself. The general worry this block was
  minted with, that a tree describing less than the chip has is a limit on every future driver, did
  not survive contact: the vendor tree describes 56 nodes under `/soc` including this one. What it
  has is stale *names*, and the answer to a stale name is to match both, at the one place that reads
  it.

## BUGS

- **Nothing here has touched silicon.** The node's presence in the running firmware's tree is
  inferred from that firmware's source at the right vintage, not read off the board. It is a strong
  inference (the model string, the two neighbour nodes, and the PLIC node in
  `crates/machine_discovery/tests/fixtures/visionfive2-uboot-control.dts` all match that source) and
  it is still an inference. The `fdt print` above is what turns it into a fact.
- **The firmware could have been built from a tree this repository has not read.** The banner names
  a Jenkins build of a release branch, not a commit, so "the last change before Feb 12 2023 on
  `JH7110_VisionFive2_devel`" is a reasonable reading of which source went in and not a proven one.
  The last row of the table above is what that possibility looks like from the boot tour.
- **Accepting `starfive,trng` is a claim about a register layout, made from two drivers agreeing.**
  Neither driver was run. If the vendor tree's node were somehow a different block at the same
  address, this change would hand a confined userspace process a mapping of it, which is the same
  authority milestone 159 already grants and no more.
- **`status` is read and deliberately ignored.** A future device whose tree honestly says
  `disabled`, meaning it, will be driven anyway. That is the right trade for this board and it is
  not obviously right for the next one; the field is there so a caller can change its mind without
  changing the decoder.
- **The `dtb` crate's `MAX_DEPTH` is 16 and this fixture's node sits at depth 3.** The real control
  DTB's `/soc/trng@1600C000` is at the same depth, so the limit is not in play, but nothing in the
  test proves that about the real tree because the real tree is not in the test.
