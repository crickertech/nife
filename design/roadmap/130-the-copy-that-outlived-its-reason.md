# 130. The copy that outlived its reason: one trap instruction, forty-eight sites

**Status: BUILT** 2026-08-17, merged as #284. Raised the same day from a code-smell survey calef
asked for. Two of the four findings were built; the other two were investigated and deliberately
not built, and for those the investigation is the deliverable rather than a gap.

The number was minted provisionally by the lane against a tree whose highest was 129, and it stuck:
131 was minted beside it while this was in flight and there was no collision.

**This block's own status was stale for the length of one merge**, which is the failure it is now
an instance of. The lane wrote "the status flip to BUILT is the integrator's at merge" and then
nobody flipped it, so `main` went red on the check that milestone 78's sweep added days earlier:
IN-PROGRESS naming a branch the history has already merged. Caught by re-running the gate rather
than by anyone noticing, which is the whole argument for the gate. The fix is this edit; the lesson
is that "owed at merge" is rung four, and the gate that caught it is rung two.

## What this is

Four findings, ranked by what they cost. The survey that produced them is worth stating in full,
because the honest headline is that **the tree is clean**: 155,000 lines carry eleven TODO-shaped
markers, each with a recorded reason, and thirty-six `#[allow]`s against one workspace lint table.
A scanner pointed at this repository mostly finds deliberate decisions. These four are the
exceptions, and only the first is interesting.

### First: the panic handler, and the reason that went stale

Forty-eight sites across `user/`, `crates/` and `fs_server/` inline the same two `asm!` blocks:
`brk #0` on aarch64, `ebreak` on riscv64. Fifty-eight `#[panic_handler]`s in userspace have drifted
into **seven variants** of the same intent.

The reason it is like this is written down, which is what makes it worth fixing rather than worth
arguing about. `crates/user_rt/src/lib.rs:14` records a deliberate decision not to put the handler
in the runtime crate: a panic handler is per-final-binary, putting one in a library forces it on
every program that links the crate and collides with any program wanting its own, and "each binary
keeps its own **one-line** handler; it is trivial."

**The first clause is still right and the last one stopped being true.** The handler is fifteen
lines with two `unsafe` blocks and two `// SAFETY:` comments, so the tree now asserts a
load-bearing safety invariant eighty-eight times by copy-paste, against a `DECISIONS` §61 note
saying a SAFETY comment is an assertion and not a formality. And the same file's header claims
`user_rt` is "the one place in userspace that names" the two ABIs, which forty-eight files
falsify.

**The drift is real, and one instance is semantically different.**
`user/src/terminal_sink_caretaker.rs:101` calls `exit()` and never traps. That is a different
outcome, not a different spelling: `sched::exit` reports `EVENT_EXIT` where `sched::fault` reports
`EVENT_FAULT` (`kernel/src/sched.rs:1185-1196`), so a panic there would tell a supervisor the
program finished cleanly. **It is latent, not a live bug**, and the block says so rather than
inflating it: the adapter is built with `fault: None`
(`crates/system_initializer/src/lib.rs:605-618`), so nothing observes the difference today. It
becomes real the day someone endows that spawn site with a supervision endpoint, which is a
one-line change.

**The fix already exists in the tree and never propagated.** `supervision_proto::fail()` and
`swap_proto::fail()` are byte-identical copies of the asm, lifted into shared crates, and thirteen
programs already delegate their handler to one of them. So the work is not inventing an
abstraction whose requirements are unknown, which is the thing `user_rt`'s own header is careful
about; it is finishing a lift that stopped at thirteen of fifty-eight and landed in two protocol
crates rather than in the runtime crate that documents itself as owning the two-ABI surface.

The shape: a `trap()` in `user_rt`, a `user_rt::panic_handler!()` macro that expands to the
`#[panic_handler]` in each binary, and the two `fail()`s delegating instead of duplicating. The
macro is what preserves the per-final-binary property the original decision was right about, so
this overturns the stale half of that note and keeps the sound half.

**Both names were shipped marked provisional, and that was wrong** (corrected 2026-08-17, on
calef's ruling). The naming tenet scopes itself precisely, to "a crate, a program, or a shared
module", and a function and a macro inside an existing crate are none of those. `script/names`
implements exactly that scope in its three categories, so neither name could ever have reached the
ratification worklist: `script/names trap` answers "neither a name in the tree nor a recorded
refusal", and it says the same of `send`, `recv`, `exit`, `invoke` and `reap`, which have sat in
this crate unratified since 19f.6 without anyone thinking them owed. Marking these two provisional
promised a ruling that nothing would ever ask for, which is worse than not marking them: an
unratified name a reader can see in a worklist is a worklist item, and one nobody can see is a
false note in the record.

This is CLAUDE.md's ladder, rung one against rung zero. The current arrangement holds only because
forty-eight authors each remembered.

### Second: `mkinitrd` does one job three ways

`xtask/src/main.rs:3249` builds the aarch64 archive with nineteen hand-rolled `let` bindings of
seven identical lines each, then a loop over a thirty-three-name array doing exactly the same
thing, then a hand-written `files` vector re-listing the first nineteen by the same string
literals. Its riscv sibling `initrd_riscv` already does it correctly: one `(archive_name,
bin_name)` table, one loop.

Folding the nineteen into the existing array deletes about a hundred and fifty lines and drops the
cost of adding a user program from four edits to two.

**What this is not:** the two archives genuinely differ (aarch64 omits `system_initializer`, `blk`,
`driver` and `hello`), and that is deliberate and already recorded at `xtask/src/main.rs:743`. The
survey checked for drift between them and found none. The smell is the three mechanisms, not the
contents.

### Third: two long functions, and the length turns out to be load-bearing

**Tried, measured, and deliberately not done.** This is the finding, rather than a thing left
undone, and it is worth more written down than the refactor would have been.

`kernel_main` is 908 lines (`kernel/src/main.rs:93`), of which 281 are comments.
`syscall::invoke` is 581 (`kernel/src/syscall.rs:97`). The obvious seams in `kernel_main` are
already marked by `cfg` blocks: a 515-line `#[cfg(target_arch = "riscv64")]` boot report, and a
285-line `#[cfg(not(any(test, feature = "bench")))]` banner and init handoff. Both capture nothing
from the enclosing scope but `dtb`, so extracting them is mechanically trivial, and the lane did
it: the two bodies came out **byte-identical**, and `kernel_main` dropped to 112 lines.

**It broke the build, in a way that is a real property rather than a lint being fussy.** With the
blocks inline, all four features (`bench`, `shell`, `smb_serve`, `initboot`) compile with **zero
warnings on both architectures**. Extracted, `bench` and `shell` warn on riscv64 and `smb_serve`
warns on both. The cause is that these features park early: each is a `cfg`-gated block ending in
`arch::halt()` or `bench::run()`, and everything after it is unreachable in that configuration.
One divergent function absorbs that; two functions do not, and `-D warnings` is a gate.

The code already said so, and nobody had connected it to the length. `kernel/src/main.rs:768`
explains that `smb_serve` parks in place "instead of compiling the tour and the init handoff out,
so this feature manufactures no dead code for the lint to chase". That property holds **because**
`kernel_main` is one function with one divergent tail. Both candidate splits were tried, and both
signatures for the extracted function (`-> !` and `-> ()`); the unit return was worse. Extracting
either block breaks a different feature, so there is no version of this split that is free.

So `kernel_main` is long because it is the single divergent boot path, and that is a design, not a
defect. `syscall::invoke` was not touched: its length is one arm per object method, which is the
shape of the thing it dispatches.

**What this costs, honestly:** a reader still meets a 908-line function. The mitigation is that the
reason is now recorded here and the experiment does not need repeating. If someone wants this
split later, the thing to solve first is the early-park pattern, not the function.

### Fourth: `xtask`'s `-> bool`, and a finding that did not survive being checked

**Mostly withdrawn.** The survey ranked this on counts, and the counts were real while the defect
they implied was not. Recorded in full rather than quietly dropped, because a wrong finding that
gets checked is worth as much as a right one and this file is the only place that record can live.

The claim was: forty-eight functions returning bare `bool` and a hundred and thirteen `return
false` sites each preceded by an `eprintln!`, so every failure is printed and flattened where it
happens, nothing composes, and no caller can branch on why a step failed. What reading the sites
showed:

- **The message prefixes are consistent and correct.** Every command prefixes with its own name
  (`std-src:`, `mkinitrd:`, `bench:`), so a failure says which step failed. That is the thing an
  error type would have been introduced to buy.
- **Most bare `return false` sites are correct propagation, not silence.** Of the twenty-five with
  no adjacent `eprintln!`, nearly all are `if !build() { return false; }` or `if !cargo(...) {
  return false; }`, where the callee has already reported. Re-reporting would be worse.
- **The one that looked silent is deliberate.** `screendump` returns `false` when the QEMU monitor
  socket is not there, and its doc comment says so: the caller treats it as "try again", so it is
  a retry signal rather than an error. `kernel_test_elf` prints on every failure path it has,
  including the one where cargo's JSON schema changes under it.

So converting forty-eight signatures to `Result` would add an error type, a conversion at every
boundary and roughly ninety edits, to reproduce diagnostics the tree already emits. That is the
"more abstraction, more machinery" that CLAUDE.md's elegance tenet explicitly refuses, and the
honest reason to want it was that it looks tidier.

Nineteen of the hundred and thirteen sites are gone anyway, as a side effect of the `mkinitrd`
work above; the count stands at ninety-four.

**What survives, and it is the half that was never about `bool`:** 6,785 lines in a single
`main.rs` with no module structure. That is a real navigability cost and a mechanical fix, since
the compiler verifies a module split completely.

**It should be its own milestone, and it should be scheduled rather than taken by a passing lane.**
`xtask/src/main.rs` is one of the three named merge hotspots where every lane wires its test, and
CLAUDE.md's lane-count rule is built on the measurement that collisions scale through files rather
than through lane count. A wholesale restructure of this file conflicts with every lane in flight,
so it wants a quiet queue and a maintainer sequencing it, which is exactly the call this lane
cannot make for itself.

## Scope note

This milestone is boilerplate and tooling. It moves no syscall, adds no dependency, changes no wire
format, and takes no `DECISIONS` section: the reasoning lives here and in `notes/`, per the rule
about lanes and global resources. If the `user_rt` change turns out to want a `DECISIONS` entry
(it overturns a recorded decision in a doc header, which is arguably enough), that is the
integrator's to mint at merge.

## BUGS

**Resolved, and it cost a pull request.** This lane was opened on
`claude/code-smells-review-3uipoy`, a prefix `script/lint` does not recognise (§77's list), mandated
by the harness and unchangeable from inside the lane. CI was unaffected, because `pull_request` runs
build the merge commit and run detached, which that check skips by design; what failed was a local
`script/lint`, on the prefix and nothing else.

calef ruled `feature/` on 2026-08-17 and the maintainer renamed the branch. **GitHub's branch rename
closed the pull request rather than retargeting it**, which is not its usual behaviour, so #278
became #284 with the same branch and the same commits. Recorded because the next person to rename a
branch under an open pull request should expect it.

The wider question the rename raised is not this milestone's: calef asked what the prefix taxonomy is
for, a grep found that **nothing consumes it except the check that enforces it**, and the proposal to
retire all of it except `milestone/N-` (the one prefix §90's roadmap-block check actually reads) is
separate work.


## Follow-on

- **Decision.** `design/decisions/94-what-may-live-in-a-library.md` is the section this block's
  scope note left for the integrator to mint if the `user_rt` change turned out to want one. It
  does: the decision keeps the sound half (a `#[panic_handler]` is per-final-binary, so a library
  defining one collides with any binary wanting its own) and retires the stale half (that each
  binary must therefore hand-roll the trap).
- **Refused.** Splitting `kernel_main`. Tried and measured: the two `cfg` blocks come out
  byte-identical and the function drops to 112 lines, and the build breaks, because `bench`,
  `shell`, `smb_serve` and `initboot` each park early in a `cfg`-gated block ending in
  `arch::halt()`. One divergent function absorbs the unreachable tail; two do not, and `-D warnings`
  is a gate. A reader still meets a 908-line function, and the thing to solve first is the
  early-park pattern rather than the function.
- **Refused.** Converting `xtask`'s forty-eight `-> bool` signatures to `Result`. Reading the sites
  withdrew the finding: every command already prefixes its own name, most bare `return false` sites
  are correct propagation where the callee has reported, and the one that looked silent
  (`screendump`) is a documented retry signal. An error type plus a conversion at every boundary and
  roughly ninety edits would reproduce diagnostics the tree already emits.
- **Recorded.** `design/roadmap/130-the-copy-that-outlived-its-reason.md`'s BUGS section keeps what
  the branch rename cost: GitHub closed the pull request rather than retargeting it, so #278 became
  #284 with the same branch and the same commits. The next person to rename a branch under an open
  pull request should expect it.
- **Unclaimed.** Split `xtask/src/main.rs`, 6,785 lines with no module structure, into modules. The
  compiler verifies the split completely so the edit is mechanical; what it needs is a scheduled
  slot, because that file is one of the three merge hotspots every lane wires its test into and a
  wholesale restructure conflicts with every branch in flight.
- **Unclaimed.** Decide whether to retire the branch-prefix taxonomy down to `milestone/N-`, the one
  prefix §90's roadmap-block check actually reads. A grep found nothing else consumes it, so the
  rest is a gate enforcing a convention with no consumer. `design/decisions/77-branch-prefixes.md`
  answers which prefixes belong on the list and assumes it stays, so retiring it is calef's call.
