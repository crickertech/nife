# 305. The six kernel confinement rows get a falsification a machine can replay

Built 2026-09-16. Minted 2026-09-16 by the maintainer. *(Number provisional until the
merge queue lands it.)*

## The finding this started from is that the blocker had already been removed

`design/fatal-risks.md`'s risk 7, the claim that the confinement claim is false, says in the entry a
reader meets it in: *"Six kernel confinement rows still have no mechanism at all."*
`notes/confinement-claims.md`'s `BUGS` explained why, and the explanation was **stale on the day it
was read**:

> Automating it needs a way to run one kernel test by name, which does not exist:
> `kernel/src/testing.rs`'s runner takes no filter, `cargo xtask test` parses only `--arch`, `--cpu`
> and `--hvf`...

**Milestone 210 built that on 2026-08-31.** `cargo xtask test --test <substring>` filters the kernel
suite; the filter is baked into the test binary by `kernel/build.rs` and read by the runner. 210's
own `BUGS` even names the three things a kernel sweep would still need and says it did not build
them. Nobody connected the two records for a fortnight, and `script/lint` reported the consequence
out loud on every run without anybody acting on it: *"`kernel/falsifications/user.c_seam_tests...`
falsifies something that is not a Kani harness; nothing sweeps it."*

That is worth stating plainly because it is not a gap in anybody's knowledge. Both facts were
written down, in-tree, in files that cite each other. What was missing was the one edit that makes a
tool read both.

## What was built

`script/falsifications` learns a second thing to read a `Falsification:` block above (a kernel
`#[test_case]`, not only a `#[kani::proof]`) and a second verb to replay it with (`cargo xtask test
--arch <a> --test <fn>`, not only `cargo kani --harness`). Nothing about §134 changes: the three
states, the block's spelling and the patch path `<package>/falsifications/<module.path>.<fn>.patch`
all carry over, and the evidence that they carry over cleanly is that milestone 202's existing patch
filename already obeys the convention with no special case.

**Kernel tests are opt-in where harnesses are mandatory.** `--check` fails a harness with no block,
because all 145 of them should say which of the three states they are in. There are 312
`#[test_case]`s and almost none is a confinement claim, so the same rule there would buy a wall of
`unfalsified`. The both-directions patch check is what keeps opt-in honest: a patch under a package's
`falsifications/` must be claimed by a harness **or** by a test, and an unclaimed one is still rot.

**Ten kernel tests now carry a record and nine are `replayable`**, up from one that nothing could
replay. `notes/confinement-claims.md`'s rows 21 to 26 are the six the risk-7 entry named; they are
nine tests between them, because two of those rows cite more than one. Eight of the nine carry a
patch. The ninth is row 26 and it is `unfalsified` for a reason given below.

**One bug was fixed rather than recorded**, because it was a confinement test that could not fail.
See the first finding below.

## What the sweep found, which is the part worth reading

### A confinement test that could not fail, and had not been able to since milestone 41

The first sweep came back with one **SURVIVOR**, and it is the result this milestone is for.

Row 21's RISC-V twin, `the_page_tables_say_u_mode_cannot_read_the_kernels_memory`, was patched to
remove the `U`-bit check from `mmu::user_can_read` entirely, which is as complete a break of that
test's stated property as can be written. The test ran and **passed**.

The defect was not weak. `user_can_read` walked through `translate_user`, and `translate_at` builds
its `Mapper` with `Half::Low`, always, so the high-half kernel address the test asks about came back
`None` before any leaf was read. `assert!(!mmu::user_can_read(kernel_va), "the page tables say
U-mode could read the kernel's own memory")` answered "no" by refusing to look. It could not fail.

**The tree had already written down the cause and nothing connected it.**
`is_mapped_in_current_space`, forty lines away in the same file, exists for exactly this case and
says so in its own doc comment: *"a user thread reaching for the kernel's memory names a high-half
address ... `translate_user` alone would say 'not mapped' for it and turn the most interesting case
into the wrong answer."* `user_can_read` went on calling `translate_user`.

Fixed here (`translate_in_either_half`, `kernel/src/arch/riscv64/mmu.rs`), measured both ways on
riscv64: green with the fix, and red under the patch at `riscv_virtio_tests.rs:142` with the test's
own sentence, *"the page tables say U-mode could read the kernel's own memory."*

**Two things follow and both are larger than this row.** A green confinement test is consistent with
its assertion being *unable* to fail, which is `notes/confinement-claims.md`'s opening sentence
arriving from a direction nobody had checked; the note says a passing test is consistent with the
component never reaching the address, and this is a third world where the *test* never reaches the
question. And **nothing but a falsification could have found it**: every gate in this tree was green
throughout, for four weeks, because a vacuous assertion is a passing assertion.

### The §31 shape recurs, and the second instance is row 24

Milestone 202's headline finding was that §31's leading sentence, the witness-page equality, is
reachable only by an escape that faults anyway, so the assertion the claim is quoted for is not the
one that catches a broken confinement. **Row 24 is the same shape in a different subsystem.**
`two_shells_with_different_roots_cannot_name_each_others_files` states its property twice: once as an
exact verdict bitmap per shell, and once as the crossing, `assert_eq!((a & nb::REACHED_SECRET, b &
nb::REACHED_INNER), (0, 0), "a shell named a file in the other shell's root")`. The second is the
sentence the milestone makes and the one a reader would quote. It is **below** both per-shell checks
and **it cannot run**: any defect that causes a crossing sets a forbidden bit in one of the reports,
and `assert_report`'s first direction catches that one call earlier. No patch tried here made the
crossing fire, and none can. The quotable sentence is documentation; the bitmap equalities are the
mechanism.

**Here the hazard costs nothing**, and saying so is what keeps it from being overstated:
`assert_report`'s messages name the offending or missing bit, so a reader learns as much as the
crossing would have told them. §31's instance cost the reader a 234-second watchdog timeout. Same
shape, benign outcome, and the thing to carry is the rule rather than the alarm: **in a test that
states its property twice, the readable statement is usually the unreachable one.** Two instances,
found the same way, neither visible without breaking the claim.

**Row 24's own record is weaker than the row looks, and the patch says so.** The recorded defect
turns the test red through `assert_report`'s *second* direction at `shell_navigation_tests.rs:99`,
the vacuity guard: with the caretaker serving the filesystem root, the shell could no longer reach
its own files, so *"every refusal it reported proves nothing"*. Nothing crossed. It proves the test
is wired to the real root handle; it does not demonstrate a crossing.

### Row 26 cannot be falsified as written, and the reason is the syscall rather than the test

`a_client_of_the_stable_rendezvous_cannot_become_its_server` got the honest defect: delete the
kernel's `Rights::READ` check on `RECV_CAP`, so a client really can receive on the stable
rendezvous. The run came back as **a 60-second watchdog reading "no progress ... a lost-wakeup
hang"**, with a thread dump and not one word about impersonation.

The reason is structural. `RECV_CAP` is a **blocking** receive, so an attacker the kernel fails to
refuse does not come back and report an escape; it takes the message the honest server was waiting
for and everything blocks. The assertion that states the claim is reachable only when the kernel
*does* refuse.

**So the row is `unfalsified`, on purpose.** The easier defect, changing which error the refusal
returns, does fire the assertion and leaves the claim entirely intact, which is evidence of nothing
and would put a false claim in the record whose job is saying what is known. Row 17's disposition,
one rung over.

**Proposed milestone (provisional, the integrator mints the number): give the usurper a bounded
wait, so an escape is reported rather than waited out.** It is the same move milestone 202 made for
§31 when its break surfaced as a 234-second timeout, and it needs a non-blocking or timed receive,
which is the syscall surface and therefore calef's. Until it exists, row 26 has a test and no
evidence that the test can fail.

### A red for the wrong reason, caught and swapped rather than recorded

Row 23's first patch was the faithful one: the claim is the kernel's, so break
`CapabilityTable::delete` and watch the progenitor rebuild. It turns the test red, and it turns it
red at `authority_tests.rs:112`, inside the `run_tree` helper, on *"the supervision tree could not be
built: stage 3"*, because a `delete` that deletes nothing breaks the tree's construction long before
the progenitor gets to the part where it drops anything. Right answer, useless diagnostic; milestone
202's hazard exactly.

The recorded patch is the fixture edit instead (`root_supervisor` keeps the untyped it is supposed to
give away), which fails at `authority_tests.rs:165` on the test's own sentence. **The refused patch
is in the record with its measurement**, because "we tried the better-looking defect and it failed
for the wrong reason" is the kind of thing that gets rediscovered otherwise.

### A defect is not always expressible on every ISA, and row 21 is where that bites

Row 21 says *"A user program cannot read a kernel address, on every ISA"* and names three tests, one
of them RISC-V's. The aarch64 falsification is one flag at one call site: map the kernel's `.rodata`
with `Flags::user_rodata()` and EL0 may read it, while the kernel goes on reading it too because
this kernel never sets `PSTATE.PAN`.

**The same defect cannot be booted on RISC-V.** `crates/paging`'s Sv39 encoder turns `CAP_USER` into
the `U` bit, and S-mode access to a `U` page faults unless `sstatus.SUM` is set, which this kernel
sets only inside a test helper. A kernel that marked its own memory user-readable there would not be
a kernel userspace can read; it would be a kernel that cannot read itself, dead before the first
test. So RISC-V's twin is falsified at the software walk instead (`user_can_read` stops reading the
`U` bit), which the test's own doc comment names as the thing under test on that ISA, and the record
says so rather than implying parity it does not have.

**DECISIONS §19 makes parity a gate for the capability; this is a gap in the evidence, not in the
capability.** It is recorded on row 21 and in `script/falsifications`' `BUGS`.

## What it costs, measured on patagonia

| Run | Wall clock |
|---|---|
| One filtered kernel test, aarch64, cold worktree | 1 min 08 s |
| One filtered kernel test, riscv64, warm | 9.9 s |
| `script/falsifications --sweep`, 41 records (39 Kani + 2 kernel) | 1 min 53 s |
| `script/falsifications --sweep`, 48 records (39 Kani + 9 kernel), **warm** | **2 min 55 s** |
| The same 48, on a tree where each patch forced a rebuild | about 22 min |

**The spread between those last two rows is the number worth carrying, and it is not about the
mechanism.** A kernel falsification is cheap when the tree it reverts to is already built, and
expensive when the patch touches a crate the kernel and the user programs both depend on, because
then each apply and each revert costs the archive, the standard-library exerciser and five disk
images. Milestone 210 measured QEMU start to `running N tests` at 0.50 s and a warm filtered run at
8.6 s; the riscv64 row above is that number confirmed independently. **So the boot was never the
cost and is still not.**

Two consequences are recorded in `script/falsifications`' `BUGS`. `--affected-since`, the per-PR
half, deliberately covers only the Kani records, because its whole argument is that a falsification
runs one harness and a kernel boot per record would spend minutes on every pull request touching
`kernel/`. And `--count` stays Kani-only so `script/lint`'s drift check against `script/metrics`
keeps comparing two derivations of one fact; that check fired on the first run here, correctly, and
`helpers/rust_source.py` was fixed rather than the check suppressed.

## BUGS

- **A kernel record is swept on one architecture, the one its patch's `Architecture:` line names.**
  Defaulted to `aarch64`. Row 21's riscv64 record is the only one that is not, and the reason it is
  not is in that patch rather than here.
- **`Architecture:` is a provisional spelling**, this lane's. It is a field in a patch's prose head
  beside `Falsifies`, which is where the sweep reads it, and calef names things.
- **The sweep checks a red's shape, not its sentence.** It requires the kernel to have booted and
  selected exactly one test before a non-zero exit counts as red, which is what keeps a patch that
  does not compile from reading as a successful falsification. It cannot check that the failure came
  through the assertion the patch's prose predicts, so it prints the panic line and leaves that to a
  reader. Milestone 202's 234-second watchdog timeout is the failure this still leaves on the table.
- **A skipped test is reported as an error and it is the likeliest flake here.** Rows 24 and 26 skip
  when no RedoxFS disk or no device page is attached, and a skip means the falsification was never
  attempted. Calling it green would be the manufactured fact milestone 214's skip accounting exists
  to refuse.
- **`design/fatal-risks.md`'s risk 7 still says "Six kernel confinement rows still have no mechanism
  at all"**, and that sentence is now false. A lane may not edit `design/` outside its own roadmap
  block, so it is left for the integrator. Nothing gates it: `script/fatal-risks` checks a cited
  milestone's status against its block, and risk 7 cites neither 210 nor this one.
- **Eight patches is not six claims.** Rows 21 to 26 are six claims and nine tests, and a
  falsification is per test. A row whose tests are falsified one at a time is stronger than a row
  with one patch and weaker than a row where every assertion in every test has been shown to fire.
- **Row 25 is one of its four directions.** The compositor test proves the input-slot refusal, the
  write fault, the witness digests and the third client's read of the screen; the patch reaches the
  write fault, and the other three are downstream of it and never run. The row reads "yes, one of
  its four" for that reason.
- **Row 23's evidence is about the test, not about the kernel.** The recorded patch is a fixture
  edit, so it proves the test notices when the drop does not happen. That the *kernel* is what makes
  the drop stick is rows 4 and 5's evidence, not this row's. The refused kernel-side patch and its
  measurement are in the patch file.
- **One defect was found in a test and fixed here, which is a lane doing two things.**
  `user_can_read` on riscv64 was corrected in this milestone rather than left as a proposal, because
  the alternative was recording a row as `unfalsified` when the reason was a two-line bug in a
  test-only function with no production caller. It is a kernel edit in a falsification milestone and
  it is called out here so a reviewer does not have to find it in the diff.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 417.** A bounded wait for the usurper in `kernel::user::live_swap_tests`, so that a client
  the kernel fails to refuse reports an escape instead of taking the honest server's message and
  hanging the run. Row 26 of `notes/confinement-claims.md` is `unfalsified` for exactly this reason,
  measured here as a 60-second lost-wakeup watchdog. It needs a non-blocking or timed `RECV_CAP`,
  which is the syscall surface and therefore calef's.
- **Recorded.** In `script/falsifications`' own `BUGS`: a kernel record costs about a minute rather
  than a second, so `--sweep` is no longer a thirty-second command; `--affected-since`, the per-PR
  half, covers only the Kani records; a kernel record is swept on the one architecture its patch
  names; and the sweep checks a red's shape rather than the assertion its prose predicts.
- **Recorded.** In `notes/confinement-claims.md`'s `BUGS`, beside the table: a kernel row's evidence
  is re-checked far less often than a harness row's and on one architecture, so a **yes** there is a
  machine-replayable fact that nothing replays on a schedule.
- **Done.** `script/lint`'s standing complaint that
  `kernel/falsifications/user.c_seam_tests.a_c_out_of_bounds_write...patch` "falsifies something that
  is not a Kani harness; nothing sweeps it". Something sweeps it.
- **Done.** `user_can_read` and `user_can_write` on riscv64, which answered by refusing to look at a
  high-half address, so `the_page_tables_say_u_mode_cannot_read_the_kernels_memory` could not fail.
  Fixed by `translate_in_either_half`; checked both ways on riscv64 (green with the fix, red at
  `riscv_virtio_tests.rs:142` under the patch).
- **Recorded.** In this block's own `BUGS`, because there is nowhere nearer a reader:
  `design/fatal-risks.md` risk 7 says "Six kernel confinement rows still have no mechanism at all",
  which is now false. A lane may not edit `design/` outside its own block and nothing gates that
  sentence (`script/fatal-risks` checks a cited milestone's status, and risk 7 cites neither 210 nor
  this one), so the edit is the integrator's and is named in the pull request too.

## Index row

Milestone 210 built `cargo xtask test --test <substring>` on 2026-08-31 and nothing connected it to the six kernel confinement rows in `notes/confinement-claims.md` that it unblocked, whose `BUGS` went on saying the mechanism "does not exist" for a fortnight while `script/lint` reported the consequence on every run. `script/falsifications` now reads a `Falsification:` block above a `#[test_case]` and replays it by booting one architecture, so rows 21 to 26 carry eight replayable patches instead of six "no"s. **The finding worth the milestone is a survivor**: row 21's RISC-V twin stayed green under a patch that removed the `U`-bit check entirely, because `user_can_read` walked through a `Half::Low` mapper and answered "U-mode cannot read the kernel" by refusing to look at a high-half address. That assertion had been unable to fail since milestone 41, every gate was green throughout, and only a falsification could have found it; the walk is fixed here and the test now goes red on its own sentence.
