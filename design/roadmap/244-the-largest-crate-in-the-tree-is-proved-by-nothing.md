# 244. The largest crate in the tree is proved by nothing a mutation can reach

**Status: RECORDED.** Measured and deliberately not built: this block's own "what would make this
milestone wrong" clause fired. Minted 2026-09-03 by calef, from milestone 238's (the scheduled checks
that never run) first published mutation report; measured and closed 2026-09-03 by the lane on
`milestone/244-system-initializer`.

**Gate: NONE.** Nothing is missing; what is missing is a way for a test to reach the code.

## What the lane was asked to do, and what it found

The block below is kept as it was written, because the finding is a verdict on its own question and
a reader has to see the question to weigh the answer. This section is the answer.

**The pure fraction is small, so nothing was lifted.** That is the outcome this block named in
advance as the one worth reporting rather than building through, and the numbers are:

`cargo mutants --list -p system_initializer` generates **196** mutants (five more than the 191 the
238 report scored, because the file moved between the two runs). By cargo-mutants' own function
attribution:

| | mutants | share | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `boot` | 97 | 49% | the build sequence |
| `spawn_service` | 32 | 16% | the `RECV` loop, one syscall per step |
| `fill_entropy`, `build_caretaker`, `announce`, `reclaim`, `must`, `must_ok`, `memory_region_split` | 28 | 14% | syscalls with a loop around them |
| `hex_password`, `sentence` and its `push`, `boot`'s own second copy of that `push`, `opt_cap`, `archive_name`, `measured` | **33** | **17%** | pure: bytes in, bytes out, no capability touched |
| top-level `const` arithmetic | 6 | 3% | not movable; they are what the rest is written against |

**A sixth of the mutants and about a fiftieth of the lines.** The six pure functions total roughly
sixty lines of a 2,632-line file, and every one is a leaf helper of the sequence beside it:
`measured` fills a `Lookup` that only `boot` destructures, `opt_cap` reads one word out of one
`recv_cap`, `archive_name` is `Some(p.name())`. Lifting them buys 33 reachable mutants and costs
exactly what this block predicted: a crate of fragments, a wider public surface, and a reader holding
two files to follow one boot.

**The tree's own analogous case was checked and runs the other way up.** `script/lint`'s bare-metal
gate names `redoxfs_server` as the pattern to copy: `user_rt` behind an optional `el0` feature, the
sans-IO core host-testable and the EL0 binary behind `required-features`. That works there because
the sans-IO core is most of the package. Here the sequence *is* the package, and the same split would
put 2,570 lines behind the feature and 60 in front of it. Worse, it would make `cargo mutants` report
a score for a crate whose boot path does not exist in the configuration being scored, which is a
number a reader would take for a claim about the init. **An honest zero beats a flattering fraction.**

### The finding that was worth more than the lane

**`system_initializer` was never in `.cargo/mutants.toml`.** The other three crates in its position
(`supervision_proto`, `swap_proto`, `virtio`) are, and that file's own head comment says its list
"deliberately mirrors script/coverage's exclusions" and asks the next person to "keep the two lists
in step". That is rung four of AGENTS.md's ladder, and it drifted by exactly one crate: the largest
one, added to `script/lint` and `script/coverage` when milestone 96 created it and never to the
mutation config. So the 191-mutants-0-caught line in the first published mutation report was not a
measurement of this crate at all. It was a crate being scored against a suite that could not compile
it, and it was one of the three crates that report blamed for the tree's score falling from 92.4% to
83.4%.

Fixed, and the rung raised so it cannot recur: `script/lint`'s "host pass excludes exactly the
bare-metal crates" gate already derived the set from `cargo metadata` and checked two consumers
(`script/lint`'s own clippy lines, `xtask/src/main.rs`). **It now checks four**, and the two it
gained are the two that publish a number: `script/coverage`'s exclusions and `.cargo/mutants.toml`'s.
Verified by removing the new entry and watching the gate fail, naming the crate and the file.

### The corrected mutation numbers

Removing a crate no host test could reach changes a published rate, so `notes/mutation-testing.md`
carries the recomputation rather than a quiet edit: the round-robin shard's 83.4% becomes **85.3%**
and the `slice` shard's 74.4% becomes **81.0%**. Neither is a new measurement. Both are the same runs
with a denominator that no longer counts mutants nothing could have killed.

### What is left, and it is not a host test

**The largest single group of mutants is the one a lift would not have reached either.** Thirty-four
of `boot`'s 97 delete a field from a `ChildEndowment` struct expression: a child built with no
`caps`, or no `stack_pages`, or no `maps`. Twenty-four more are slot-counter arithmetic and twelve
flip a rights mask's `|` to `&` or `^`. Those are not logic with a wrong answer. They are a
**declaration of what each component of the system may do**, expressed as inline struct literals in
the middle of a syscall sequence, and the only two things that can check a declaration are the boot
itself and a test comparing it against a separately written expectation. That is the lane worth
having, and it is proposed below rather than attempted here.

## BUGS

- **This does not close the other three excluded crates.** `supervision_proto`, `swap_proto` and
  `virtio` are excluded for the same reason and are not in this block. Whether the same argument
  applies to them is not answered here; the measurement above is cheap to repeat for each
  (`cargo mutants --list -p <crate>`, then read the function attribution) and nobody has.
- **The 33 pure mutants stay unreachable and that is a cost, not a nil.** `measured` is the one that
  matters: it is measured boot's refusal policy, where "the table says nothing about this name" and
  "the table says something else" must both refuse, and a single mutant sits on it. It is proved
  today only by `script/shell-check` booting a system whose table happens to be right.
- **A mutation score over the lifted crate is not a claim about the init**, and no lift happened, so
  there is no score. What proves the init is `script/shell-check`, unchanged.
- **`script/shell-check` remains the only thing that runs a real init**, and nothing here changes
  that or should be read as reducing its standing. The gate this lane added is about a *report*, not
  about the boot.

## Proposed follow-up: the boot wiring is a declaration, so let it be data

*(Provisional; the integrator mints the number.)* Thirty-four of `boot`'s mutants delete a field from
a `ChildEndowment` literal, and nothing in the tree would notice. The proposal is not a host unit
test, which cannot see them, but making the wiring **a table this crate walks** rather than a
sequence of literals, so that a host test can assert the table (what each boot component is endowed,
with which rights) without a kernel underneath, and `boot` becomes the walk over it. What that buys
beyond the mutants is the thing this crate's own `BUGS` section already spends four paragraphs on:
the capability-table budget is a property *of the table*, and today it is discovered by a boot that
prints nothing at all.

The honest cost, so it is priced rather than assumed: the sequence's order is load-bearing (this
crate's head comment says so, over three evenings' worth of evidence), so the table must be ordered
and the walk must be the same order, and a table that is really a sequence with extra ceremony is
worse than what is there now. Whether it can be genuinely declarative is the fork that lane opens
with, and it is calef's.

---

*Everything below is the block as minted, kept because the verdict above is an answer to it.*

**In brief.** `crates/system_initializer` is **2,632 lines with zero `#[test]`**, and milestone 238's
report scored it **0 caught of 191 mutants**. Every mutation of every function in it survives.

**That is not negligence, and reading it as negligence would produce the wrong lane.** `script/lint`
excludes the crate from the host pass on purpose, and says why beside the exclusion: it takes an
unconditional dependency on `user_rt`, which is EL0 `asm!`, so it cannot compile for the host at all.
Four crates are in that position (`supervision_proto`, `swap_proto`, `virtio`, and this one) and this
is much the largest. `cargo mutants` builds the crate and then runs a workspace suite that
structurally cannot reach it, so the zero is arithmetic rather than a discovery.

The crate's own head comment already names what proves it instead, honestly:

> the thing that actually proves this code is `script/shell-check`, which boots both ISAs and types
> at the prompt.

**That gate is real and it is not nothing**, which is the fact that makes this milestone a judgement
rather than an alarm. `script/shell-check` is the only thing in the tree that runs a real init, and
milestone 96 exists because a fix landing in one init and not the other produced *a boot that reaches
userspace and prints nothing at all*, with no fault and no message, three times. What it cannot do is
tell which of 191 mutations it would have caught, and a gate whose coverage nobody can state is a
gate nobody can improve.

### What this milestone is, in one sentence

**AGENTS.md's own rule, applied to the largest place the tree breaks it:**

> Pure logic (allocator algorithms, page-table math, scheduling policy, filesystem parsing) belongs
> in crates that compile for the **host**, so most tests run in milliseconds without an emulator.

This is milestone 193's (put `kernel/src` within reach of the prover) **option B** with a name and a
number. 193 chose option A for the kernel and said the honest answer is probably both, with the split
decided by where a property naturally lives. This block is that sentence cashed out for the one crate
where the cost of not doing it is measured rather than argued.

### What is actually in there, because the split is the whole question

The crate holds two kinds of code and they are not mixed evenly:

- **Logic with a right answer that a host can check.** Reading the archive, decoding a `grant_plan`
  off the spawn channel, checking a `measured_boot` manifest against what it is about to load,
  choosing addresses to map an image at. All of this is `no_std` arithmetic and parsing over bytes.
- **Syscalls on capabilities the kernel granted at spawn.** `boot` returns `!`, and every step it
  takes is an `svc`. There is nothing to assert and nowhere to assert it.

**The deliverable is the first kind moved somewhere a test can reach, not the second kind
simulated.** A mock kernel is the failure mode to avoid here: it would produce a large green suite
proving that the mock behaves the way the code expects, which is the thing already assumed.

### The proof that this milestone worked

**A mutation run over the new host-reachable crate catches most of what it generates**, reported the
way milestone 238's does, plus the number that shows the split was worth making: how many of
`system_initializer`'s 191 mutants now live in code a host test can reach.

Not a line count moved, and not a test count. Either of those is satisfiable by moving the easy half.

### What would make this milestone wrong

Worth stating in advance, because a lane that finds it should say so rather than build anyway:

**If the pure fraction turns out to be small.** The crate may be mostly syscall sequencing with
arithmetic threaded through it, in which case lifting it produces a crate of fragments, a wider
public surface, and a reader who now has to hold two files. That is a worse tree than a 2,632-line
crate with an honest note saying `script/shell-check` is what proves it. **Measure the fraction
before moving anything**, and if it is small, say so and stop; the finding is worth more than the
lane.

*(This is the clause that fired. See the verdict at the top.)*
