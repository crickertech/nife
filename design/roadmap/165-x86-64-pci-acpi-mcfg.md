# 165. x86_64 PCI enumeration: wire `kernel/src/pci.rs` to ACPI's MCFG

**Status: BUILT 2026-09-02.** Was PARTIAL from 2026-08-24 until then; the three things it owed are
either built elsewhere (PCI interrupt routing by milestone 215, VT-d by milestone 161's item 6) or
closed below (a real BAR placement, now measured under real firmware). Minted 2026-08-24, provisional number pending the integrator (mint against the
current index at merge; two other numbers in this neighborhood were already taken by open pull
requests when this was written, one of them proposing a milestone for the JH7110's PLDA PCIe root
complex driver, unmerged as of this writing so not cited here by number). Scoped the same day as
that other proposal, as a parallel check of whether x86_64 can reach a real-hardware data point for
[DECISIONS §86](../decisions/86-el0-nvme-driver.md) faster and cheaper than a from-scratch JH7110
driver would, given that x86's PCIe discovery is ACPI-described and architecturally identical
between QEMU's `q35` and real x86 hardware (unlike RISC-V's QEMU-only fake ECAM device).

It never needed a syscall surface, a new dependency or a `DECISIONS.md` section of its own, and it
took none. What it unblocks (real NVMe-behind-IOMMU on x86) was gated on VT-d, roadmap item 6 of
milestone 161, which has since been built.

## The gap, as `notes/x86-port.md` already named it

Milestone 161 (the x86_64 kernel port) landed real ACPI table parsing (the RSDP scan, the root
table walk, the MADT, and the MCFG) against real hardware evidence (the Dell OptiPlex 7050 Micro,
milestone 87, x86_64's real target machine). `notes/x86-port.md`'s "discovery seam" section recorded
the gap this milestone closes: "The PCIe ECAM window the MCFG describes is exactly the constant
`arch::mmu::PCI_ECAM_PHYS` hardcodes... The constant should come from here rather than being checked
against here, and doing that is a line of code once something consumes it." `kernel/src/pci.rs`
itself said the same thing at its own probe: "A machine whose tree has no such node... answers every
probe here with nobody home", true of x86_64 unconditionally, since it has no device tree at all.

## What was built

1. **The seam.** `memory::record_pci_regions` fills `memory::pci_regions()` directly (the same
   static every probe in `pci.rs` already reads), the x86_64 counterpart of how `memory::init` fills
   it from a `pci-host-ecam-generic` device-tree node on the other two architectures. Called once
   from `main.rs`'s boot tour, right after `read_acpi`, with the ECAM window from ACPI's MCFG and a
   hardcoded BAR window (see the BAR paragraph below).

2. **The real complication, found by measurement rather than assumed away.** Reading ACPI's MCFG is
   not sufficient by itself. QEMU's monitor was used to check directly (`xp` on the physical address
   the MCFG names, before any kernel code ran): the address **faults** ("Cannot access memory"),
   not the all-ones an absent PCI *device* would read. The chipset's ECAM decode is off until
   something programs the host bridge's `PCIEXBAR` register (offset `0x60` in bus 0, device 0,
   function 0's configuration space): a real BIOS or UEFI does this before ever handing control to
   an OS, and PVH (the protocol this port boots through) is a hypervisor entry point, not firmware,
   so nothing has. `arch::x86_64::machine::enable_pcie_ecam` programs it through the legacy
   `CONFIG_ADDRESS`/`CONFIG_DATA` ports (`0xcf8`/`0xcfc`, already-existing primitives in
   `arch::x86_64::port`, written for exactly this and unused until now), and the same address was
   then confirmed, still via the monitor, to read the host bridge's own vendor/device id
   (`8086:29c0`) once the register was enabled. This is very likely a PVH-only step: real firmware
   (what milestone 87's OptiPlex will boot through) does this already, and rewriting the same base to
   the same value there should be a no-op. It is written unconditionally rather than assumed so this
   port does not depend on that being true.

3. **The BAR window is hardcoded, not discovered, and this is a real, permanent limitation rather
   than a temporary gap.** ACPI's MCFG names only the ECAM window; the 32-bit MMIO window BARs are
   placed in lives in the PCI host bridge's `_CRS` object on a real ACPI machine, which is AML, and
   this kernel has no AML interpreter (`notes/x86-port.md`'s own "What is deliberately not decoded").
   `arch::x86_64::mmu::PCI_BAR_PHYS` is a hardcoded constant (`0xc000_0000`, q35's conventional PCI
   hole), confirmed disjoint from RAM, ECAM, the HPET and both APICs by reading QEMU's `info mtree`,
   but **not exercised by an actual BAR placement**: no PCI function that needs one is on the bus
   under the current runner (see below).

4. **Proof, under QEMU's `q35`.** `kernel::pci::tests::acpi_mcfg_wires_a_real_ecam_window_that_finds_the_host_bridge`
   (new, x86_64-only) enumerates the bus through the ACPI-sourced, now-enabled ECAM window and
   asserts it finds q35's own host bridge (bus 0, device 0, function 0, vendor `8086`, device
   `29c0`), a chipset function present regardless of what `-device` flags the runner does or does
   not pass. `script/test` on all three architectures: aarch64 295/1, riscv64 298/1, x86_64 99/6 (one
   skip converted to one pass versus the pre-existing baseline; no regressions). `script/lint` green.

## What was deliberately not built

- **`scripts/qemu-runner-x86_64.sh` was not touched.** q35 already presents six PCI functions with
  zero `-device` flags (host bridge, VGA, a default NIC, ISA bridge, SATA/AHCI, SMBus; measured via
  QEMU's monitor `info pci`), which is what made proof possible without changing the runner's default
  device set at all, the exact fork the brief for this lane flagged as needing to stop and report
  rather than silently changing. It did not arise.

- **An actual `-device nvme` attach was investigated and is NOT safe today**, which is worth
  recording precisely because it looked free. `xtask` already sets `NIFE_NVME` unconditionally for
  every architecture's leg, and both aarch64 and riscv64 runners already wire it; only x86_64's
  does not. But `kernel::nvme::tests::the_nvme_disk_serves_the_block_interface_end_to_end` hard-
  asserts `crate::iommu::active()`, and `arch::x86_64::iommu::active()` is a permanent `false` (no
  VT-d built; roadmap item 6 of milestone 161). `nvme::bring_up()` itself tolerates an inactive
  IOMMU (it runs the controller unconfined, printing nothing), so attaching the device would not
  skip the existing test, it would turn it into a **hard failure** on the confinement assertion.
  Getting a real NVMe device working on x86, confined, is therefore gated on VT-d/DMAR parsing, not
  on anything this milestone touches. This was established by reading `nvme.rs` and
  `arch/x86_64/iommu.rs` directly rather than by running the experiment and breaking the suite.

## What this does and does not establish for DECISIONS §86

**What it establishes**: the *discovery* half of what a real hardware data point needs. x86's PCIe
enumeration mechanism (ACPI's MCFG naming an ECAM window, a chipset register enabling its decode,
then ordinary config-space reads) is now proven under QEMU using the same mechanism real x86
hardware uses; nothing about the mechanism itself is QEMU-specific the way the device is on RISC-V.
Milestone 87's OptiPlex, once it boots this kernel, should need no code change here to also
enumerate its own real PCI bus; only the values (its own MCFG base, its own BAR hole) will differ,
and if real UEFI leaves ECAM already enabled, `enable_pcie_ecam`'s rewrite should be a no-op.

**What it does not establish**: §86 is about a *confined userspace NVMe driver*, and confinement is
exactly the piece this milestone cannot touch. x86 has no IOMMU driver at all (VT-d, item 6), so
there is no path from what is built here to "NVMe behind a real IOMMU" without first building VT-d,
which is a materially larger piece of work than this one (a DMAR table walk, translation table
setup, and fault handling, the same shape §16b's SMMUv3/RISC-V IOMMU drivers took) and is out of
this lane's scope by the brief that started it. The proposed JH7110 driver (see the note about it
above) has the same gap in reverse shape: it would reach real NVMe hardware over a real
(non-QEMU-fake) discovery mechanism, but RISC-V's IOMMU driver already exists (milestone 16b), so
its path to a *confined* data point is shorter once its hardware bring-up lands. **Read plainly: x86
got the cheaper half of §86's evidence (discovery) at low cost; the JH7110 path still owns the
harder half (confinement over a real, non-fake root complex) for its own architecture, and x86 needs
VT-d built first to catch up on that half here. Neither path alone gives §86 the full data point it
is holding out for.**

## What 2026-09-02 found, and what it corrects

Three things, and the first of them is why this block did not stay closed as a wiring exercise.

### The ACPI walk refused every table on a machine with real RAM

`arch::x86_64::machine::reachable` bounded the walk at 1 GiB, on a comment saying the boot map
"aliases only the low gigabyte". `boot.s` has never done that: it builds 2048 page-directory
entries of 2 MiB covering the low 4 GiB, points both the identity entry and the direct map at them,
and says so in its own comment, because the APICs and the ECAM window are all above 1 GiB.

Nothing caught the disagreement, and the reason is the interesting part. **Firmware places its ACPI
tables just under the top of RAM**, and both QEMU runners pass `-m 256M`, so the tables landed at
`0x0fb7e014` and fit under a bound four times too small. Booted under OVMF with `-m 2048` they land
at `0x7fb7e014`, and the same kernel came up with **no RSDP, no MADT, no MCFG and no DMAR**:
no APIC, no timer, no PCI, no VT-d, on a machine that had described all four. Every real x86 machine
has more than 1 GiB, so this was unconditional on xenon and invisible in every gate.

With the bound at the boot map's real extent the same 2 GiB boot reads the XSDT, the MADT and the
MCFG, enables the ECAM window at `0xe0000000`, brings up both APICs and the timer, and completes.

**The gate moved to where the bug was**, rather than a test being added beside it: the UEFI runner
now boots at 2 GiB by default (`NIFE_MEM` sets it back for the memory-map comparison in
notes/x86-uefi-boot.md), and `cargo xtask uefi-boot` asserts the end of the chain, a PCIe window
enabled from an MCFG entry read at a high physical address. Falsified rather than assumed: with the
bound put back to 1 GiB that gate fails on all three of its assertions. It also fails on the
"outside the boot map" line the walk now prints, because this is the one failure that looks like a
healthy boot from outside, a tour that completes on a machine that simply has no devices.

### The PCIEXBAR write was unconditional, and the fault that justified it does not reproduce

`enable_pcie_ecam` wrote the register unconditionally with a 256 MiB length field, reasoning (in
this block, above) that rewriting the same base under real firmware "should be a no-op". It is a
no-op only if the length agrees too. Firmware may size the window at 128 or 64 MiB, and the write
then **widens the chipset's decode over whatever physical addresses sit above it**, which on xenon
is discovered at a null modem. Chipsets that lock the register after firmware writes it are the
other half: there the write is dropped and only a read back would ever say so.

It now reads first, treats "enabled at the base the MCFG itself reports" as firmware's own work, and
writes only otherwise, with the length derived from the MCFG's bus count. A bus count the register
cannot encode leaves the window as found and says so.

**And the measurement above is corrected.** Re-measured on QEMU 11.1.1 from inside the guest, which
is the side being served, the register reads `0xb0000001` on the PVH path **before anything writes
it**, and the whole suite's PCI half (the MCFG witness, NVMe, both userspace PCIe driver tests)
passes with this function writing nothing. The monitor still answers "Cannot access memory" at that
address on the same boot, so the monitor and the guest disagree, and this block's original reading
of the monitor as evidence about the guest's decode does not hold. Nothing needs to decide whether
QEMU changed or the inference was always wrong, because the register is asked rather than assumed.
The consequence to record is that **the writing arm is now unexercised on both paths this kernel
boots**, and stays for the machine that genuinely arrives with the decode off.

### The BAR window: measured under real firmware, and it is not a corner case

Item 3 above called the hardcoded BAR window "a real, permanent limitation" and noted it was not
exercised by an actual placement. It is exercised now (milestone 215 drives a `virtio-blk-pci` disk
whose BARs this kernel places), so the open question changed shape: not whether the placement works,
but **how much of the machine it moves, and whether the place it moves things to is free there.**

`pci::bar_census` (provisional name) answers both in one read-only pass of config space, printed on
the x86 boot line: functions on the bus, and functions carrying a BAR outside the window
`mmu::map_everything` maps. Measured 2026-09-02: **5 of 8 under PVH, 3 of 6 under OVMF, 4 of 7 with
a `virtio-blk-pci` disk attached.** Real firmware placing the addresses does not change the shape of
the problem, only which addresses, and `place_bars` relocates them all into `PCI_BAR_PHYS`
(`0xc000_0000`, 2 MiB mapped), a constant checked once against QEMU's `info mtree`.

That is the number to read first on xenon's first boot: a machine whose RAM reaches above
`0xc000_0000` would have this kernel move most of its bus on top of memory, and the line says so
before anything is driven.

## Two decisions this block had left open, now made

- **No MCFG means no PCI, with no fallback to the legacy `0xcf8`/`0xcfc` mechanism**, which this
  kernel could reach (`enable_pcie_ecam` uses it) and which would enumerate bus 0 with no ACPI at
  all. Those ports see only the first 256 bytes of a function's configuration space, so a machine
  that fell back would enumerate a **different** set of capabilities than one that did not, every
  extended capability simply absent, and a driver that then failed would fail somewhere else
  entirely. This is milestone 215's own refusal one level up: when a machine wants MSI and meets a
  function without MSI-X, bring-up fails loudly rather than degrading into the original bug.
- **An MCFG whose first bus is not 0 is refused rather than adjusted.** `kernel/src/pci.rs`
  addresses a function as `base + (bus << 20 | ...)` with an absolute bus number, and subtracting
  `lo << 20` (the arithmetic that looks like the fix) names a base below the window
  `mmu::map_everything` maps, turning config reads into reads of whatever is underneath it. Every
  machine seen reports 0 and none is required to, so it is checked and said out loud.

## What is proven where

**On patagonia, under QEMU:** enumeration through an ACPI-sourced ECAM window on both boot paths,
including one where the MCFG's base (`0xe0000000`) differs from the constant, and including tables
read at a physical address a real machine would use. Real firmware leaving the ECAM decode already
enabled, so this kernel writes nothing. A count of how much of the bus this kernel relocates, under
both firmware and no firmware.

**Only xenon can confirm:** that `PCI_BAR_PHYS` is free on that machine, which is the census's whole
point; that its firmware presents an MCFG with first bus 0 and a bus count `PCIEXBAR` can encode;
and that its ACPI tables are below 4 GiB, which every machine's are and none promises.

**One of milestone 215's three xenon-only questions is now half answered.** That block owed "that a
real function's MSI-X table is reachable once *firmware* rather than this kernel has placed its
BARs". Under OVMF firmware does place them, and the census says where: outside this kernel's window,
so `place_bars` moves them and the MSI-X table is reached through the kernel's own address rather
than firmware's. What is still unproven is the same thing on silicon, and the reason it cannot be
proven here is the handoff below: the suite does not run under real firmware, only the tour does.

## What is owed

- **The 32-bit MMIO window should come from the machine, not from a constant.** Proposed milestone,
  unnumbered (numbers are the integrator's). `_CRS` is AML and stays refused, but AML is not the
  only source: the memory map firmware already hands over names the gaps, and Intel's host bridge
  reports `TOLUD` in its own configuration space. Its measure is `pci::bar_census`'s second number
  becoming zero, or the window being one this machine agreed to.
- **Run the x86_64 suite under real firmware, not only the tour.** Proposed milestone, unnumbered.
  `cargo xtask uefi-image` stages the boot-tour kernel; the test kernel is a different binary and
  nothing stages it. Doing so would close two of milestone 215's three xenon-only questions on
  patagonia rather than at a null modem, because OVMF places BARs and enables interrupt remapping
  the same way real firmware does.
- **VT-d and PCI interrupt routing**, which this block owed and no longer does: milestone 161's item
  6 and milestone 215 respectively.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 195.** Run the x86_64 suite under real firmware, not only the boot tour. This block
  listed it as an unnumbered proposal on the day milestone 195 shipped it: `cargo xtask uefi-test`
  runs the kernel suite under OVMF with the same 192 passes and 68 skips as under PVH.
- **Milestone 161.** VT-d, which this block owed and could not touch. It is milestone 161's roadmap
  item 6, and it is what a confined userspace NVMe driver on x86 (DECISIONS §86) is gated on.
- **Milestone 215.** PCI interrupt routing, the other thing this block owed while it was PARTIAL.
- **Refused.** Falling back to the legacy `0xcf8`/`0xcfc` mechanism when a machine presents no MCFG.
  Those ports see only the first 256 bytes of a function's configuration space, so a fallback would
  enumerate a different set of capabilities than the ECAM path does, with every extended capability
  simply absent, and a driver that then failed would fail somewhere else entirely. No MCFG means no
  PCI, said out loud.
- **Refused.** Adjusting for an MCFG whose first bus is not 0. `kernel/src/pci.rs` addresses a
  function with an absolute bus number, and subtracting `lo << 20` names a base below the window
  `mmu::map_everything` maps, turning config reads into reads of whatever sits underneath it. Every
  machine seen reports 0 and none is required to, so it is checked and refused rather than fixed up.
- **Recorded.** In `design/roadmap/165-x86-64-pci-acpi-mcfg.md`: the `PCIEXBAR` writing arm is
  unexercised on both paths this kernel boots, since QEMU's PVH path already reports the window
  enabled and OVMF enables it too. It stays for the machine that genuinely arrives with the decode
  off, and nothing has run it.
- **Recorded.** In `design/roadmap/165-x86-64-pci-acpi-mcfg.md`: three things only xenon can
  confirm, which are that `PCI_BAR_PHYS` is free on that machine, that its firmware presents an MCFG
  with first bus 0 and a bus count `PCIEXBAR` can encode, and that its ACPI tables sit below 4 GiB.
  `pci::bar_census` prints the first of them on the boot line, so it is the number to read first.
- **Proposed.** `design/roadmap/proposed/a-bar-window-the-machine-agreed-to.md`, take the 32-bit
  MMIO window that BARs are placed in from the machine rather than from the hardcoded
  `arch::x86_64::mmu::PCI_BAR_PHYS`. `_CRS` is AML and stays refused, but the firmware memory map
  already names the gaps and Intel's host bridge reports `TOLUD` in its own configuration space. The
  measure is `pci::bar_census`'s second number reaching zero, or a window the machine agreed to.
  Recording it is not enough: a machine whose RAM reaches above `0xc000_0000` would have this kernel
  relocate most of its bus on top of memory.
