# 219. The boot tour ends and the kernel halts, so there is nothing to soak

**Status: BUILT** (2026-09-01). Minted the same day by the maintainer, after radon booted under
script control and the gap became obvious: everything needed for a sustained run exists except a
workload that lasts. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

It needed no board to build and no board to test (this block carried `Gate: NONE`, now removed
because a finished milestone gates nothing). QEMU runs it; a board is only where the answer becomes
interesting, and no board has run it yet.

**In brief.** `design/fatal-risks.md` risk 5 (it cannot be made reliable on multicore, and the bugs
appear only on silicon) names its decisive experiment as *sustained multi-core stress on the boards
with the load-sensitive assertions live*. It is the risk that has already fired once, on radon, with
a receiver woken and nothing delivered on three harts, found in a bench session rather than by any
test.

**Nothing in this tree could sustain anything.** The kernel's boot tour ran its checks, printed
`nife: the capability core runs on RISC-V.`, and called `halt()`. Captured on radon on 2026-09-01,
that is the last line, after which the board sits in `wfi` indefinitely. A soak needs a workload
that keeps running, and there was not one.

That was the whole milestone: **something that runs on every core, for hours, that fails loudly.**

## What was built

`--features soak` replaces the halt at the end of the boot tour with a pool of user-mode workers and
a supervisor that watches them forever. `notes/soak.md` is the account; the pieces are
`kernel/src/soak.rs`, `user/src/soaker.rs`, `crates/soak_page`, `script/soak`, `script/board-image
--soak`, and `Stage::Soak` in `crates/board_console`.

It runs on all three architectures under QEMU and is the same workload that would run on radon,
argon and xenon. `script/soak --arch <a>` boots it and judges it with the same recogniser and the
same policy `script/board-console` points at a board, so the rehearsal and the experiment are one
thing with different deadlines.

### The four questions this block left open, answered with evidence

- **What it stresses: cross-core IPC rendezvous, at the highest rate the machine will do them.** Not
  a guess about where the bugs are, but where the one bug this risk produced was. A round trip is
  `CALL` -> `RECV_CAP` -> `REPLY` -> the caller waking: two block/wake handshakes, the protocol
  `crates/thread_wake_handshake` models. Each worker jitters between round trips so the pairs'
  phase keeps drifting; a soak that repeats one interleaving for eight hours has explored one
  interleaving.
- **How it fails loudly: three verdicts, checked every beat, each ending in a thread dump and a
  panic.** A refused wake (the gate in `sched::wake_load_aware` firing, which is the defect itself),
  a caller getting back a word that is not the answer to what it sent, or a worker making no
  progress for a whole beat.

  **Which existing instrument it extends, and why the other two could not be it.** It extends
  `crates/board_console`, so the QEMU rehearsal and the bench run are judged by one recogniser.
  `script/repeat-under-load` repeats a **terminating** suite under induced host load and reports a
  distribution over runs; a soak has no runs to repeat, and the load it wants is the guest's own.
  `script/interleaving-check` is loom over the extracted protocols on the host, which searches a
  state space rather than watching a machine, and is the complementary evidence rather than the
  same evidence. Both are named in `notes/soak.md` as what they are: neither was the right place to
  put a boot that never ends.
- **A user program, with the detection in the kernel.** The defect is causable from userspace
  through the real syscall path, so a kernel-mode stress loop would be testing an artefact of the
  test; and a user program cannot assert about kernel internals, so the assertions stay where the
  trace counters are. The two meet over one shared page with one writer per word
  (`crates/soak_page`).
- **What "it passed" means: a round-trip total, and three comparisons it supports.** Between
  architectures, between QEMU and silicon, and against the same machine later. First numbers, QEMU
  on patagonia, 2026-09-01: **aarch64 ~58,000/s on four cores, riscv64 ~24,000/s on four,
  x86_64 ~3,900/s on one.** All three from a `--features soak` build, whose IPC path is 1.05 to
  1.06x the production one; compare a soak number only with another soak number. Nothing else. See
  the BUGS section, which is the important half.

### And a fifth question this block did not think to ask

**A saturated workload does not migrate between cores under this scheduler.** Measured across three
topologies and both multicore architectures: the cross-core handoff count freezes within the first
second and never moves again, while the machine does tens of thousands of round trips a second.
Rendezvous wakes are local by design (DECISIONS §28.2), `wake_load_aware` is reachable only from a
device interrupt, a work steal needs an idle core *and* a queued thread elsewhere, and nothing
rebalances periodically.

So "sustained multi-core stress" is **two** experiments, and this milestone delivers one of them:
concurrent contention on shared kernel state, at rate, on every core. It does not deliver cross-core
handoff under load, which is where the observed defect lived. `script/soak` prints that gap on every
run rather than leaving it to be discovered.

The instrument that found this was the second one. The first counted `trace::Event::PlaceRemote`,
which is structurally blind to the migration a rendezvous performs, because the wake queues the peer
on the waker's own core and so the *placement* is local even when the *thread* has moved.
`thread::Thread::last_cpu` and `trace::Event::Migrated` answer the question at `schedule()`'s
`switch_in`, which every path to a CPU passes through.

## How a hang is distinguished from a slow run

**The heartbeat is on the wall clock, not on the work.** A machine doing one round trip a second
still prints on time, with a rate that says so; a machine doing none still prints, and its stall
check fires. Silence means the thing that prints is itself wedged, which is the only thing silence
is allowed to mean.

`crates/board_console` implements the other half rather than agreeing to it in prose. `Stage::Soak`
is reached by the kernel's own `soak: started` line, and reaching it **re-arms the quiet check that
a completed boot tour suppresses**: a halted kernel is supposed to be quiet and a soaking one is not.
One word (`< Stage::Tour` became `!= Stage::Tour`), asserted on a real QEMU capture cut off after its
second heartbeat. The beat is five seconds against a fifteen-second default quiet window: three
missed beats, exit status 2.

## What would make it a real answer to risk 5

Running it on **radon**, **argon** and **xenon**, not just in QEMU, since the entire premise of the
risk is that emulation cannot show these defects. `notes/soak.md` carries the bench procedure, step
by step, including which flag builds the payload in the order the measured-boot gate requires.

**None of the three has been run at a bench yet.** That is the remaining half of this milestone and
it needs a person, a board and an evening, not a lane.

## The gate this got wrong first, and what it cost

The instrumentation shipped unconditionally in the first version of this lane, and
`script/fastpath-footprint` caught it: `ipc_fastpath` grew **5.7% on aarch64** (5,788 -> 6,120
bytes), over milestone 132's 5% bound, with riscv64 and x86_64 at 4.7% and 4.6% behind it. One cause
with three effects; aarch64 was merely the one that tipped. The single largest contributor is the
`Thread::last_cpu` write, which sits in `schedule()`'s switch, the hottest line of the hottest
function, and the per-event counter increments are the rest.

The fix is `#[cfg(feature = "soak")]` on the counters, the accessors and the `last_cpu` field, so a
production build is **byte-identical to what it was**: measured at 5,852 / 5,132 / 6,687 on this
branch against exactly those three numbers at the commit it was cut from. The 5% bound was not
touched, and it should not be: it is Liedtke's cache-footprint argument, which is the oldest
performance case in microkernels and the reason the gate exists.

Two consequences worth stating rather than leaving to be found. **A soak build is not a production
build**, its IPC path is five to six per cent larger, and the round-trip figures above are therefore
soak-build figures; `notes/soak.md` carries the per-architecture table. And a `cfg`-gated instrument
is invisible to clippy, so `script/lint`'s per-feature loop now includes `soak` on both ISAs, which
on its first run found two real warnings in code nothing had ever linted.

## BUGS

- **This block sets no duration**, and the honest reason is that nobody knows what duration would
  be persuasive. The risk's own text says this class "produces a confidence rather than a verdict".
- **A soak that finds nothing is weak evidence and must be reported as such.** The failure mode to
  guard against is a green run being quoted as though it proved the concurrency correct. What a
  clean eight hours licenses is one sentence: *this machine did N cross-core IPC round trips without
  the wake gate refusing one, without a wrong reply, and without a worker stalling.* `script/soak`
  prints that caveat on every green run, because a number quoted without it is quoted wrongly.
- **The soak does not cover the path the observed defect was on.** `wake_load_aware` takes a device
  interrupt to reach, and no user workload can raise one. This is the sharpest form of the caveat
  above and it was not known when this block was written.
- **The heartbeat is guest time and the watcher's deadline is host time**, so a QEMU guest on a
  heavily loaded host can produce a false `WentQuiet`. `--quiet-after` is the knob; not running a
  soak beside other heavy work is the better answer.
- **A soak build is not the binary that ships.** Its `ipc_fastpath` is 1.05 to 1.06x the production
  one, so its timing differs, and nothing in this milestone's numbers is a statement about how fast
  this kernel does IPC. `script/bench` is the instrument for that.
- **Nothing runs a soak inside `script/test`**, so the feature can stop compiling without anything
  saying so until someone runs `script/soak`. A twenty-second leg per architecture would close it
  and was judged too expensive for a gate every lane runs.
- **`--arch x86_64` soaks one core** unless told otherwise, because that runner defaults to one and
  its SMP bring-up has two open bugs (`arch::x86_64::ap_boot`'s BUGS #1 and #3). Its `crossings=0`
  says so out loud, and a single-core soak is not a multicore soak.

## Handoff

Two proposed milestones, both of which this lane found and neither of which it should decide,
because each is a scheduler-policy or syscall-surface question and those are calef's:

- **Proposed milestone: a workload can be made to cross cores, or it is admitted that none can.**
  The options are thread affinity (pin a responder so its callers must reach it from elsewhere), a
  periodic rebalancer, or a userspace-drivable interrupt source. Each changes what the scheduler
  promises; the first two also change what a program may ask for. Until one exists, the second half
  of risk 5's decisive experiment cannot be run at all, which is a fact about the risk rather than
  about this workload.
- **Proposed milestone: run the soak on radon, argon and xenon.** The procedure is written and the
  tooling is built; what it needs is a bench, a night, and the numbers recorded in
  `notes/soak.md`'s table beside the QEMU rows. Milestone 218 (every boot needs a human typing four
  commands into U-Boot) makes it cheaper but does not block it.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 221.** The first proposed milestone in this block's handoff: a workload can be made to
  cross cores, or it is admitted that none can. calef answered the fork in
  `design/decisions/138-cross-core-handoff-under-load.md` and 221 built the `sched::on_tick` hook.
- **Milestone 225.** The second: run the soak on radon, argon and xenon, which is where its answer
  means anything. The procedure is written and the tooling is built; it needs a bench and an evening.
- **Milestone 245.** The duration this block declined to set. Every counter `script/soak` prints is
  a volume, so no beat can be compared with the one before it and a run that stopped learning looks
  exactly like one that has not.
- **Refused.** A soak leg inside `script/test`. Twenty seconds per architecture would stop the
  feature silently ceasing to compile, and it was judged too expensive for a gate every lane runs on
  every push.
- **Recorded.** `notes/soak.md`: a soak that finds nothing is weak evidence, and what a clean run
  licenses is one sentence about round trips completed without a refused wake, a wrong reply or a
  stalled worker. `script/soak` prints that caveat on every green run.
- **Recorded.** `notes/soak.md`: a soak build is not the binary that ships. Its IPC fast path is
  1.05 to 1.06x the production one, so no number here is a statement about how fast this kernel does
  IPC, and `script/bench` is the instrument for that.
- **Recorded.** `design/roadmap/219-a-workload-that-does-not-stop.md`: the heartbeat is guest time
  and the watcher's deadline is host time, so a QEMU guest on a loaded host can produce a false
  quiet verdict. The knob is `--quiet-after`, and not soaking beside other heavy work is the better
  answer.
- **Recorded.** `design/roadmap/219-a-workload-that-does-not-stop.md`: an x86_64 soak runs one core
  unless told otherwise, because that runner defaults to one and its SMP bring-up has two open bugs.
  A crossing count of zero says so out loud, and a single-core soak is not a multicore soak.
