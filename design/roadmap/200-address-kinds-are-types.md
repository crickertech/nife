# 200. A virtual address and a physical address stop being the same type

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Minted 2026-08-31 by calef, out of milestone 196's (a physical address on
`elf::Segment`) naming discussion, when the question *"what is wrong with the tree-wide refactor"*
turned out to have no answer on merit. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**Gate: NONE.** Nothing needs deciding. The names are ratified below and the sequencing constraint is
practical rather than a fork.

**In brief.** Physical and virtual addresses are bare `u64` everywhere in this tree: `paging`,
`memory_regions`, `kernel/src/arch/*/mmu.rs`, `kernel/src/user.rs`, `syscall.rs`. Nothing stops one
being passed where the other is meant, and the mistake compiles, runs, and passes tests wherever the
two happen to be equal.

## The motivating defect, which is recorded rather than hypothetical

`notes/higher-half.md` has it. A test dereferenced the device tree's **physical** address, and the
identity map made it work by accident:

> That's a test dereferencing the device tree's **physical** address. Before, the identity map
> made it work by accident. Now, a low address does not exist, and the mistake faults on the
> spot with the offending address printed.
>
> -- notes/higher-half.md

The same note names the general shape and its consequence: *"an identity map that lingers is an
identity map that hides physical/virtual confusion, right up until userspace shows up and the
confusion becomes a security hole."*

**That is the whole case.** The mistake compiled, ran, passed, and was caught by an accident of the
address space going away rather than by anything asking. A type asks.

This is also the shape DECISIONS §134 (a harness carries a machine-replayable falsification record)
and milestone 191 (did the proofs catch the bugs?) have been circling all week: a defect no proof was
positioned to see, in code no harness reaches, prevented instead by making it unsayable. AGENTS.md's
ladder puts that at rung one, above a gate and far above a comment.

## The names, ratified 2026-08-31

| type | what it is |
|---|---|
| `VirtualCpuAddress` | virtual, as the CPU sees it |
| `VirtualDeviceAddress` | virtual, as a device sees it: the IOVA the IOMMU translates |
| `PhysicalMemoryAddress` | the one physical reality both translate into |

**Two virtual views, one physical fact.** The asymmetry says something rather than being untidy:
physical takes no view qualifier because there is only one physical address space, shared by the CPU
and by devices after translation. `notes/iommu.md`'s identity-mapped domain is that statement made
concrete, since `IOVA == PA` there.

Refusals, kept because they are the half a future proposer needs:

- **`VirtualAddress` / `PhysicalAddress`**, the terms of art, recommended twice by the maintainer and
  declined twice. They carry the recognition §39's protected class exists to preserve, and calef
  preferred explicitness. **The recognition was spent deliberately**, which is why this bullet
  exists rather than the choice being left to look inevitable.
- **`PhysicalCpuAddress`**, incoherent: it asserts a non-CPU physical address exists. It also would
  not have compiled, since `script/lint` runs clippy at `-D warnings` and `upper_case_acronyms`
  rejects `CPU` in a type name.
- **`VirtualMemoryAddress`**, because an IOVA is a memory address too, so "Memory" fails to
  disambiguate the one kind that needed it.
- **`DeviceMemoryAddress`**, which parses as *an address of device memory*, meaning MMIO, and hides
  that an IOVA is virtual at all.
- **`IoVirtualAddress`**, only because it breaks the whose-view parallel and spends an abbreviation.

## Where the types stop, and this is the design work

**Syscall arguments are `u64` by ABI**, so the wrappers cannot cross the syscall boundary. That edge
has to be designed rather than discovered: the conversion belongs at the entry point, once, where a
reader can see the untyped word becoming a typed address and check the claim being made about it.
Everything above that line should be typed; nothing below it can be.

`VirtualDeviceAddress` has no consumer today, because `IOVA == PA` under the identity map. Introduce
it anyway or leave it for milestone 143 (silicon IOMMU): this block does not decide, and the case for
introducing it now is that the type is what makes the identity mapping's assumption visible instead
of implied.

## Sequencing, which is the only real constraint

The blast radius is `paging`, `memory_regions`, three `arch/*/mmu.rs`, `kernel/src/user.rs` and
`syscall.rs`, and `kernel/src/user/tests.rs` is the merge hotspot AGENTS.md already names. **Do this
when `kernel/src` is quiet**, not while lanes are open in it.

**Kani was checked first, and it is clear.** Milestone 193 (put `kernel/src` within reach of the
prover) landed harnesses proving run arithmetic over `syscall.rs` in `u64`, so a newtype that
confused CBMC would cost this milestone those proofs. Measured 2026-08-31 rather than assumed: a
probe crate stated milestone 193's own `run_end_va` property twice, once on bare `u64` and once
through a `repr(transparent)` `VirtualCpuAddress`, both in `u128` so neither harness could repeat its
implementation back at itself.

**`VERIFICATION:- SUCCESSFUL`, 2 of 2, 0.068s for both.** The wrapper adds no measurable solver cost,
which is the number that mattered against `script/verify`'s ~650 seconds.

Two things the probe settles for whoever builds this:

- **`kani::any()` needs no new shape.** `VirtualCpuAddress::new(kani::any())` generates the raw
  `u64` symbolically and wraps it, which is what a converted harness would write. No `Arbitrary`
  implementation is required, though deriving one would read better across 145 harnesses.
- **No unwind or bound effects.** The arithmetic is identical to the solver either way, which is what
  `repr(transparent)` promises about layout and is now observed rather than trusted.

## BUGS

- **A newtype protects only while the value stays wrapped.** If every consumer immediately unwraps,
  the net protection is close to zero. The milestone is worth doing only if the mapping APIs *take*
  the types, and a version that adds wrappers without changing signatures should be rejected as
  worse than nothing, because it looks like a mechanism and is not one.
- **It cannot stop a deliberate wrong unwrap**, only the silent interchange.
- **Nothing here types MMIO addresses**, which `notes/unsafe-obligations.md` records `gic.rs::init`
  taking on trust, and which are physical addresses being used as virtual ones through a mapping.
  That is arguably the next instance of the same problem and is not in scope.
- **The refactor touches the most delicate code in the project** for a benefit that is invisible when
  it works. That is the honest cost, and it is why the sequencing constraint above is not optional.
