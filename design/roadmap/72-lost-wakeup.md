# 72. A lost wakeup that a hundred leaked threads may be causing

**Status: BUILT** (2026-08-03). The title is the hypothesis this milestone started with, and it was
wrong, which is why it is kept. The hang was **one line of test code**. It was not the leaked
threads, and it was not RISC-V. Full account, evidence and method in notes/scheduler.md under
"CLOSED: the lost wakeup"; this entry is what changed and what is left.

## What it was

`user::tests::reclaim_frees_a_started_then_exited_childs_regions` opened by probing
`reclaim_region(tcb_region).is_err()` on its own child's TCB region, over a comment reading "the
refusal leaves the region untouched". DECISIONS §16 was later amended so that a refusal is **not**
passive: it arms the kill on every live thread in the region, so an owner's retry can tear a runaway
down (§24's `^C` escalation needs that). The comment kept compiling; the child did not survive. The
scheduler converts a killed thread to a corpse at its next preemption, so whenever the timer beat the
child's nine instructions, the child was reaped **without ever sending**, the test's `ipc_recv` never
returned, and every core fell to idle: the 60 s lost-wakeup heartbeat, exactly as reported.

The fix is deleting the probe. The refusal's own behaviour is proved by
`force_kill_tests::destroy_force_kills_a_runaway_and_reclaims_its_region`, which points the
destructive call at a runaway that is meant to die, the only subject it can honestly be pointed at.
`reclaim_region` now carries a `BUGS` section saying `Err` is destructive, where a caller meets it.

## How a one-in-four race was turned into a proof

Widening the window rather than waiting for it, the method milestone 71 used on the frame fault: a
call-free three-instruction delay loop in front of `REPORT_STUB` guarantees a preemption before the
`SEND`. With the probe present that hangs the watchdog on the first run and every run; with the probe
gone the same widened child passes. The forced dump matched all four wild occurrences exactly (101
threads, 109 endpoints, every thread `wake_pending=false on_cpu=false`, all four inboxes empty).

## The parity answer is a control, not an argument (§19)

Every wild occurrence was riscv64, and **none of that is a RISC-V property**. The code is portable
`sched.rs`. Running the widened window on aarch64 hangs it identically on the first run, which is the
control that rules the ISA out; the riscv64 leg simply lost the race more often under TCG. A defect
that presents on one ISA is not thereby an ISA defect, and the cheap way to find out is to widen the
window on the other one.

## What is left, and it is a separate milestone

The **101 threads and 109 endpoints** were this milestone's stated lead, and they are not this bug:
blocked threads add no scheduling load, and 109 endpoints is a fifth of `MAX_ENDPOINTS`. The suite
accumulates them equally on both ISAs. But 101 of `MAX_THREADS = 128` is 79% of the way to a hard
`create_tcb` failure, and `thread_leak_police` polices only **runnable** leaks, so a blocked leak is
invisible to it by construction. Nothing would warn before the suite hit the wall. That wants its own
entry, with the evidence recorded in notes/scheduler.md.

## Follow-on

- **Recorded.** `notes/scheduler.md`. The 101 threads and 109 endpoints this milestone started from,
  which it proved were not the hang and then handed on as wanting an entry of their own. The note's
  "The accumulation is not this bug" section carries the whole account, including its 2026-08-27
  update: the suite did hit 128 of 128 with spawns refused and no diagnostic, `sched::MAX_THREADS`
  is 256 on a measured peak of 130, and `sched::PEAK_THREADS` reports occupancy in the closing
  summary so nobody has to instrument the kernel to see the table filling. A **blocked** leak is
  still invisible to `thread_leak_police`, which polices runnable spinners on purpose, and 130 of
  256 is 51%, so the same curve reaches the same place again.
- **Recorded.** `kernel/src/sched.rs`. `reclaim_region` returning `Err` is destructive: the refusal
  arms the kill on every live thread in the region, which is what §24's `^C` escalation needs and
  what made a comment reading "the refusal leaves the region untouched" cost four days. The function
  carries a `BUGS` section saying so where a caller meets it.
