# 386. A provenance token that agrees with its own prose

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Filed 2026-09-05 as an unnumbered proposal by milestone 264, whose largest
single finding was that a third of its worklist was this bug rather than missing research; numbered
2026-09-19 by milestone 433's drain of the proposal pile. **The premise has decayed and the block is
still real work, which is a distinction worth keeping.** The *instances* are gone: on 2026-09-05,
21 of 60 `unrecorded` names carried a complete argument in their own prose; on 2026-09-19
`script/names` reports **1 unrecorded name of 222**, and that one (`hello`) is honest, saying
outright that nobody wrote down why it is called that. So the check would fire on nothing today and
its value is as a regression guard rather than as a sweep. The *gate* is still unbuilt:
`script/names` has grown `--provisional`, `--recorded` and `--unrecorded` views and still never
compares a block's leading token against its own prose. One live instance survives outside that
tool's four kinds (crate, program, script, package): `crates/documentation/src/render.rs`'s
`unclosed_fence` carries `Name: unrecorded. Provisional, minted by milestone 40's lane on
2026-08-18 and not put to calef`, which is the contradiction exactly, in a function-level block
`script/names` does not read. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**Gate: NONE.** It reads the tree.

## The bug it would have caught

`script/names` was built with two states, `ratified` and `unrecorded`, and gained `recorded` and
`provisional` afterwards. Its own header records why, and the reason is the whole point: "nobody in
this tree can say why this is called that" needs research *and* a ruling, while "here is the
argument, nobody ever signed it" needs only the ruling, and a worklist that cannot tell them apart is
a list rather than a plan.

**Nothing swept the blocks written before the third state existed.** On 2026-09-05, **21 of the 60
names reported as `unrecorded` already carried a complete argument, refusals included, and said
"provisional" or "not yet put to calef" in their own prose.** Their leading token was simply the old
word.

So the report over-stated its hardest tier by roughly a third, and it interleaved prepared names with
unprepared ones in the one record whose entire job is telling them apart. A reader of `--unratified`
could not see which twenty-one were a read and which were a research task.

## Why no existing gate could see it

`script/names --check` asserts that a block is present and that its first token parses. The header's
BUGS section is already honest that it "cannot check that the recorded reason is still true" or "that
an `unrecorded` entry is honest rather than lazy". This is the narrow, mechanical corner of that
honest gap: not whether the prose is true, but whether the prose and the token are saying different
things about the same block.

## What it would check

For a block whose token is `unrecorded`, fail if its own text contains `provisional`, `not yet put to
calef`, `not put to calef`, or `Refused`. Each of those is the block asserting that an argument
exists, which is what `provisional` means and what `unrecorded` denies.

**The false positives are enumerable, which is what keeps this on rung two.** A block may legitimately
say "nobody recorded a decision because nobody had to make one", and none of the four phrases appears
in it. The risk runs the other way: a block that argues its name at length without using any of the
four phrases is missed, and that is acceptable, since a gate that catches the common shape is worth
more than one that tries to read prose.

## The general form, which is worth more than the check

**A vocabulary change swept the tool and not the records the tool reads.** That is not specific to
`script/names`: the same shape is available anywhere this tree derives a report from tokens embedded
in headers, which by 2026-09-05 is `script/roadmap`, `script/decisions`, `script/falsifications` and
`script/audits` as well. When a status vocabulary grows a state, the existing entries do not move,
and no gate compares an entry against the vocabulary it was written under.

## BUGS

- **It cannot tell a stale `provisional` from a live one.** A name calef has since ratified in
  conversation and nobody transcribed reads exactly like one he has not seen. That is the same limit
  the parent tool records and is not closeable by a script.

## Index row

`script/names` was built with two states and gained `recorded` and `provisional` afterwards, and
nothing swept the blocks written before the third state existed, so a worklist whose entire job is
telling a research task from a ruling interleaved the two. On 2026-09-05, 21 of the 60 names it
reported as `unrecorded` already carried a complete argument with refusals and said "provisional" or
"not yet put to calef" in their own prose, which over-stated the hardest tier by about a third. The
check is mechanical and narrow: for a block whose token is `unrecorded`, fail if its own text says
`provisional`, `not yet put to calef`, `not put to calef` or `Refused`, each of which asserts the
argument that `unrecorded` denies. It is the corner of `script/names`' own honest `BUGS` gap that a
script can reach, since it asks not whether the prose is true but whether the prose and the token
are saying different things about the same block. The general form is worth more than the check: a
vocabulary change swept the tool and not the records the tool reads, and by 2026-09-05 that shape
was available in `script/roadmap`, `script/decisions`, `script/falsifications` and `script/audits`
too. The instances were cleaned up between filing and numbering (one `unrecorded` name of 222 on
2026-09-19), so what is left to build is a regression guard, and one live contradiction sits in a
function-level block outside this tool's scope.
