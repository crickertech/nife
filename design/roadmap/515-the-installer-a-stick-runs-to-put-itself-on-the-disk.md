# 515. The installer: a stick that puts itself on the machine's disk and is then not needed

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)* Promoted from the
proposal `the-installer-a-stick-runs-to-put-itself-on-the-disk`, filed 2026-09-19, on calef's
instruction of 2026-09-20 to give every proposal on `main` a number. The text below is the
proposal's own, unedited except for this paragraph: the argument is its author's and promotion is
not the moment to improve it. Written by milestone 198's rungs lane (`milestone/198-rungs-to-a-
trivial-install`) for rung 2 of the trivial install DECISIONS §157 defines. §157's table names the
installer as owned by no milestone; this is the proposal for it.

**Gate: DECISION.** The on-disk layout of an installed system is read by every later nife that boots
from that disk, so once a stranger has installed it is a format (the layout fork below, options
only). The mechanism is reversible and is recommended. The bench half also needs milestone 261's
disk wipe, which is calef's act.

## What an install has to do, and how little of it is new

The finding that sizes this proposal: **an installed system can boot the same single file the stick
boots.** `uefi_loader` carries the kernel and the userspace archive inside `BOOTX64.EFI`
(`uefi_loader/src/main.rs`, "The kernel is embedded rather than loaded from the filesystem"), and a
boot with no filesystem still reaches the prompt (`crates/system_initializer`, the "4 without a disk,
5 with one" slot comments). So an install is four steps, and the tree already has two of them:

| Step | What exists | What is missing |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Write a partition table | `components/src/disk_partitioner.rs` (milestone 57): writes a GPT with both copies, draws GUIDs from an entropy endpoint, holds one disk and nothing else | It writes **one hard-coded layout** for a 64 MiB disk (`filesystem_protocol::fixture::blank`: ESP, a Linux partition, nife data). A layout computed from the disk's size |
| 2. Make the data filesystem | `redoxfs_server/src/bin/mkfs.rs` (milestone 57): finds the nife data partition by §45's type GUID and creates RedoxFS inside it, bounded by a `PartitionDisk` | Nothing for step 2 itself |
| 3. Put `BOOTX64.EFI` on the EFI system partition | Nothing: there is no FAT writer (milestone 140's FAT32 stratum is `NOT-STARTED` and read-first) | Both the bytes of the file and a way to write FAT |
| 4. Make the firmware boot the disk | Nothing | A boot entry, or reliance on the firmware's fallback path |

And two pieces the installed system needs on its next boot, found by reading the boot path rather
than assumed:

- **The boot mount is a whole virtio disk.** `PartitionDisk` exists only inside `mkfs`; the FS
  service the boot builds mounts a whole block device and has no NVMe arm
  (`kernel/src/user/fs_service.rs` names neither). An installed system has to mount the nife data
  partition off the NVMe server's endpoint, or it boots to a prompt with no disk.
- **The installer has to find the disk.** `block_roster` cannot name an NVMe disk; that is already
  proposed (`a-block-roster-that-can-name-an-nvme-disk.md`) and this proposal depends on it rather
  than duplicating it.

## The problem nobody had written down: the running system does not have its own file

Step 3 needs the bytes of `BOOTX64.EFI`, and **the running system does not hold them.** The loader
places the kernel's segments and hands over the archive as a module, then exits boot services; the
PE file that contained both is gone. And the file cannot be put inside the archive, because the file
*contains* the archive. So the installer needs a way to read the stick, and the options are:

| | Shape | Cost | Kept or lost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1. The loader hands its own file over** | Before `ExitBootServices`, `uefi_loader` opens its own file through the firmware (the loaded-image protocol names the device it came from, and the simple file system protocol reads it; both UEFI-standard, from the specification as recalled, not re-read) and passes the ~10 MB of bytes as a second module beside the archive | Two protocols added to a loader that uses seven function pointers today (`uefi_loader/src/efi.rs`); one more handoff field (`machine_discovery`, rule 7); the kernel hands the bytes to the installer as a read-only blob, which is milestone 233's precedent for `login` | **Recommended.** Smallest, and nife still does the install |
| R2. nife reads the stick itself | USB mass storage over milestone 242's host controller, then milestone 140's FAT32 reader | 242 is "months" by its own account and declines USB storage explicitly; 140's FAT32 is unbuilt | Lost for this rung: it makes rung 2 wait on the largest driver in the project for a file the firmware can read in one call |
| R3. The installer is a UEFI application | Runs before nife, writing the disk through the firmware's block I/O | Every step above rewritten against firmware protocols; nothing of milestone 57's confined partitioner and `mkfs` is used | Lost: it discards the one part of this that demonstrates anything (a partitioner holding one disk and no path to type), and §157 says the minimal system installs itself |

**The §92 test.** R1 would still be chosen at equal cost: it keeps the authority story (the installer
holds one disk, one entropy endpoint and one read-only blob) and adds no driver whose only job is to
re-read what the firmware already read.

## The layout, which is the irreversible half (options, no winner)

| | Layout | What it buys | What it costs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1. ESP plus data** | GPT: an EFI system partition holding `BOOTX64.EFI`, and one nife data partition (§45) for everything else | The fewest moving parts. The same shape as milestone 57's fixture less its Linux partition | An upgrade rewrites the one file in place, so a bad upgrade has no previous file to fall back to |
| **L2. ESP with two slots plus data** | As L1, but the ESP holds the current and the previous `BOOTX64.EFI` (two names, and a boot entry or a small chooser for each) | A bad upgrade can be undone by booting the other file, which is what the activation fork's A2 wants at package level, one level down (Fuchsia's A/B slots and OSTree's previous deployment are the prior art the activation proposal already read) | Twice the ESP space, and a rule for which slot is current, which is itself a format |
| **L3. ESP with a small loader, system on a raw partition** | The ESP carries a loader that reads the kernel and archive from a raw nife boot partition | The ESP stops changing on upgrade; slots move into a partition nife owns | A second loader, and a raw-partition reader in it; the most new code of the three |

Two constraints hold for all three and are recorded rather than decided:

- **The ESP must be FAT.** Whether it is FAT32 or FAT16 at the sizes involved, and the minimum size
  firmware accepts, was **not checked** and is a first task for the lane.
- **The logical block size.** `disk_partitioner` and `disk_surveyor` both assume 512 bytes because
  nothing on the `blk` wire reports it (their `BUGS`). An NVMe namespace can be formatted with
  4096-byte blocks; the Micron 2450's format is not recorded in the tree. A table written in the
  wrong unit is unreadable by every other OS, so the lane reads the namespace's format from
  IDENTIFY before writing anything.

## The ESP's contents, and the boot entry (reversible, recommended)

**Writing FAT without a FAT writer.** A host tool builds an ESP image with the file's clusters
preallocated and contiguous and its bytes left zero; the archive carries that image (it contains no
copy of the file, so it does not contain itself); the installer writes the image into the ESP, then
writes R1's bytes at the one offset the host tool recorded. That is a layout two programs agree on,
both in this tree, so it is reversible, and it is fragile in the way it looks: it is a stand-in for
milestone 140's FAT32 write half and should say so at the call site.

**The boot entry.** Two ways, and the cheap one is unmeasured:

- **B1. The fallback path on the internal disk.** Put the file at `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` on the new
  ESP and remove the stick. Whether xenon's firmware (Dell BIOS 1.27.0, `notes/xenon-firmware.md`)
  boots a fixed disk's fallback path without a `Boot####` variable is **not known**; many firmwares
  do (recalled, not read). One bench boot answers it.
- **B2. Write a boot variable.** `SetVariable` is a runtime service, and nife maps none: the loader
  never calls `SetVirtualAddressMap` (`uefi_loader/src/efi.rs`) and nothing in the kernel calls a
  runtime service (`git grep` for them finds only those two comments). So B2 is either a runtime
  services mapping in the kernel, which is new surface, or the loader writing the variable on some
  boot before `ExitBootServices`.

**Recommendation: B1 first and measure it**, on xenon and on one machine from milestone 243's fleet;
B2 only if a firmware refuses. Would B1 still be chosen at equal cost? Yes: a system that needs no
firmware variable survives a firmware reset and a disk moved to another machine.

## What a stranger's machine most plausibly has

A judgement, not a measurement. **An NVMe disk**, on anything sold in the last several years; xenon's
is a `Micron 2450 NVMe 256GB` on M.2 with SATA in AHCI rather than RAID (`notes/xenon-firmware.md`).
Two cases this proposal does not cover, recorded in `BUGS` below: **SATA disks**, which need an AHCI
driver nothing owns, and **NVMe hidden behind Intel RST or VMD** ("RAID On" in many laptops'
firmware), which milestone 261 already names as the reason xenon's AHCI setting mattered.

## Exit criteria a stranger could check

1. **Under QEMU**: OVMF boots the stick image with an empty NVMe disk attached; the installer runs,
   asks for confirmation naming the disk, partitions, formats and copies; the machine reboots with
   the stick detached and reaches the prompt; a file written before the reboot reads back after it.
   One `cargo xtask` gate, in the shape of `uefi-boot`.
2. **On xenon**, the same with a photograph, after milestone 261's wipe and bench boot.
3. **On one machine that is not xenon**, from milestone 243's fleet, which is what makes it a claim
   about PCs rather than about one Dell.

## Size, honestly

One milestone for the QEMU half: a computed layout in place of the fixture, R1's handoff and blob
grant, the ESP template tool, the installer program, the boot mount of a partition off NVMe, and the
gate. The bench half is milestone 261's remaining step plus one boot. **It depends on**
`a-block-roster-that-can-name-an-nvme-disk.md` and on milestone 261's bench step. It does not depend
on the network, on packages, or on milestone 242: an installer that asks for confirmation over the
serial console is rung 2 on xenon, and the same installer at a USB keyboard is rung 2 on a stranger's
PC once rung 1 has one.

## BUGS

- **Whole disk only.** The first installer replaces the disk's table. Installing beside Windows means
  resizing a filesystem nife cannot read, which is milestone 140's territory and a different order of
  risk to someone's data.
- **An installer is the most destructive program this tree would ship**, and the confirmation step
  is the whole of what stands between a stranger and a wiped disk. It must name the disk by model and
  size, not by an ordinal.
- **SATA (AHCI) and RST/VMD disks are not covered.** Nothing owns an AHCI driver; this is the home
  for that finding until a lane proposes one.
- **The ESP template is a stand-in for writing FAT**, and a file that outgrows its preallocated
  clusters breaks the scheme silently unless the host tool refuses it. Milestone 140's FAT32 write
  half is what retires it.
- **Nothing here is crash-atomic**, inheriting `disk_partitioner`'s own `BUGS` entry: a power cut
  mid-install leaves a disk that boots nothing. Real installers share the property; nobody has
  measured this one.
- **B1 is unmeasured** on any firmware but OVMF.
