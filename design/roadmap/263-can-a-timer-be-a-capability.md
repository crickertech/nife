# 263. Can a userspace process hold a timer, on all three architectures?

**Status: RECORDED.** Answered 2026-09-05, the day it was minted. Minted by calef as a spike under
his decision that a timed wait should be served by a userspace timer service rather than by a new
kernel blocking primitive. Nothing was built and nothing is decided: the deliverable is
`notes/timer-capability.md` and this block. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**Gate: NONE.** Reading three specifications and pricing one kernel addition. No hardware, no
decision waiting.

## The answer

**No, and therefore the userspace-timer-service answer to milestone 106 does not survive
[§19](../decisions/19-architectural-parity.md) parity.** Two clauses, and both are needed:

1. **On riscv64 no *architected* timer can be granted to U-mode**, on any machine, by the privileged
   architecture rather than by a gap in this kernel. Three independent closures, below.
2. **The one mechanism that works on all three is per-board MMIO**, and it is not uniformly
   available. Both real boards have generous spare timer blocks (argon fourteen channels, radon four,
   each channel with its own interrupt line), but **QEMU's aarch64 `virt` has no MMIO timer device at
   all**, and QEMU is what every gate in this tree runs on. A userspace timer service would be three
   different drivers and a hole, against one syscall method.

**And the block's aarch64 negative was wrong**, which is the correction worth having: aarch64 *can*
grant a comparator to **one thread** rather than to all of EL0, and the machinery to do it was built
in this tree three days ago for a different reason.

## Why a spike, and the precedent is milestone 106's own

**Milestone 106 was already priced this way**, and it worked: the pricing lane built a prototype (a
`deadline` word on `Thread`, a cached earliest, an expiry walk in `on_tick`, a blocked-thread
census), measured it, and **threw it away on purpose**, because *"shipping it would have settled the
fork by accident."* Those numbers retired the cost objection that had stood since 2026-08-04.

**This is not proposal-shaped procrastination**, which AGENTS.md warns is an available way to avoid
deciding. The direction is decided. What is unpriced is a prerequisite underneath it, and nobody can
currently say what it costs, which is the condition that earns a lane.

## The decision this sits under

calef, 2026-09-05, on milestone 106's fork: **serve the timed wait from a userspace timer service
signalling a notification, rather than from a new kernel blocking primitive.** The reasoning is in
[§101](../decisions/101-notification-objects.md), which anticipated it:

> A notification object lets a *userspace timer process* wake a thread at a deadline, which is how
> seL4 does it, but it requires that timer process to exist and to hold a clock capability.

**All four of milestone 106's named consumers are userspace** (`thread::sleep`, `Endpoint::RECV`'s
callers, the shell's `^C` poll, and `net_stack`), and §101's carve-out for a kernel timed wait names
kernel needs (a watchdog, a scheduling deadline, an in-kernel retransmit) of which **the tree has no
instance**. Both of `sched.rs`'s no-timeout complaints are about userspace callers being hung.

## The problem this spike exists to settle

**A userspace timer service needs a timer of its own**, because it cannot use a timed wait to
implement a timed wait. seL4's driver holds the hardware timer's registers and interrupt, programs
it for the next deadline, and blocks on that interrupt.

**On two of three architectures there appears to be nothing to hold**, from this tree's own headers
rather than from the specifications, which is exactly what the spike must correct or confirm:

| ISA | what the kernel's tick uses | why it may not be grantable |
|---|---|---|
| aarch64 | the ARM Generic Timer | `kernel/src/arch/aarch64/timer.rs`: *"It is **not** an MMIO device. It is **part of the CPU**, reached through system registers... There is no base [address]."* `CNTKCTL_EL1` can open EL0 access, but that is ambient across EL0 rather than held by one process |
| riscv64 | SBI TIME (`sbi_set_timer`, an `ecall` to OpenSBI in M-mode) | one timer per hart, write-only, and U-mode cannot issue SBI calls at all: only S-mode can |
| x86_64 | the local APIC timer | the exception. HPET exists with multiple comparators in MMIO, so a spare grantable timer plausibly exists here |

**Corrected against the specifications, 2026-09-05.** The table above is left as written, because
this block's own `BUGS` says it was read from this tree's doc comments and the spike existed to check
it. This is what the specifications say instead, and the working is in `notes/timer-capability.md`:

| ISA | the block said | the specification says |
|---|---|---|
| aarch64 | ambient across EL0, not holdable by one process | **wrong on both halves.** `CNTKCTL_EL1` has four independent enables, and this kernel writes exactly one of them (`EL0VCTEN`, bit 1). `EL0PTEN` (bit 9) opens `CNTP_CTL_EL0`, `CNTP_CVAL_EL0` and `CNTP_TVAL_EL0` to EL0; `EL0VTEN` (bit 8) opens the virtual set. And the bit is an EL1 register the scheduler may rewrite per thread, which is exactly what milestones 229 and 237 built for `PMUSERENR_EL0`. **The real scarcity is comparators, not authority: there is one spare (`CNTP_*`), and it traps under a hypervisor**, which is why the tick took the virtual one at milestone 9 |
| riscv64 | no U-mode path | **confirmed, and the negative is stronger than the block claimed.** Three independent closures: Sstc's every enable (`mcounteren.TM`, `menvcfg.STCE`, `henvcfg`) gates S-mode and VS-mode and there is no U-mode timer-compare CSR to enable; `stimecmp` is CSR `0x14D`, whose bits `[9:8]` are the privileged spec's own encoding of "supervisor", so a U-mode write is an illegal instruction by the address alone; and a U-mode `ecall` raises cause 8, a different cause from the S-mode ecall the SBI dispatch decodes. One `mtimecmp` per hart, already spent on the tick |
| all three | (not considered) | **the spare-MMIO-timer route the block did not name**, and it needs no new kernel mechanism, since a `DeviceFrame` plus an `Object::Irq` is how every userspace driver here already owns a device. argon's Tegra X1 has `timer@60005000`, fourteen 29-bit one-shot-capable channels on fourteen GIC SPIs; radon's JH7110 has `si5_timer` at `0x13050000`, four channels on four PLIC lines (**no mainline driver**; the binding was posted ten times and never merged). **QEMU aarch64 `virt` has none** (`hw/arm/virt.c`'s memmap has a PL031 whose alarm is one-second resolution, and a watchdog that is not created by default), and QEMU riscv64 `virt` has one, the goldfish RTC's nanosecond alarm, which this tree already drives for the wall clock. Good answer for one workload on one board; not a portable capability |
| x86_64 | plausibly a spare exists | **plausible and still unconfirmed on the machine this project owns.** The `HPET` table is in the tree's own q35 transcript (`notes/x86-port.md`) and `crates/machine_discovery` sees it and does nothing with it. **xenon's is not recorded anywhere**: `notes/x86-uefi-boot.md` says first light printed "the full table list" and the transcript is a photograph. Nobody has read this project's own `NUM_TIM_CAP` |

**[§19](../decisions/19-architectural-parity.md) makes parity a gate**, so an answer that works on
x86_64 alone is not an answer.

## What the spike must produce

1. **Confirm or refute the two negatives from the specifications**, not from this tree's doc
   comments. Can aarch64 grant timer access **per thread** rather than to all of EL0? Is there
   genuinely no U-mode path to arm a timer on riscv64, including Sstc's `stimecmp`?
2. **Price the fourth shape**, below, in the kernel. The pricing lane already measured that any
   deadline structure costs **one comparison per tick** (1.000 comparisons and 0.000 writes over
   100,000 idle ticks, for a scan and for a sorted list), so what is unpriced is the object, its
   methods and the signalling, not the bookkeeping.
3. **Say plainly whether the userspace-service answer survives parity.** If it does not, calef's
   decision changes, and it is better to know that in a day than three days into a lane.

## The fourth shape, which neither milestone 51 nor 106 lists

If the kernel must own the timer on two of three architectures, the service cannot hold one, but the
kernel can signal on its behalf:

```
Timer::ARM(deadline, notification) -> the kernel signals that notification at the deadline
```

A thread then blocks in `RECV` on its endpoint with the notification **bound** to its TCB
([§101](../decisions/101-notification-objects.md), decided 2026-08-20, unbuilt, milestone 151), and
wakes on **either** a message or the deadline. That is milestone 106's own title met.

**It is smaller than any of milestone 51's three shapes.** Not "block until a deadline", only "signal
this at T". `RECV` keeps its signature, nothing becomes ambient, and the authority to wait on time is
a capability like everything else. It is also close to what seL4 does, with the timer's ownership
moved to the only place two of our three architectures allow.

**This block does not recommend it.** It is named so the spike prices it beside the userspace
service, and because a fork should not be settled by discovering an option late.

## BUGS

- **Three headers are not three specifications.** The table above is read from this tree's own
  comments, which is how the spike was scoped and is not evidence about the hardware. Item 1 exists
  because the maintainer's reading is the thing most likely to be wrong here.
- **It prices nothing about a timer service itself**, only whether one can hold a timer. If the
  answer is yes on all three, the service is still unbuilt, unpriced, and unnamed.
- **The fourth shape is a syscall-surface addition** whatever its size, so it is calef's under §10
  and this spike may only measure it.
- **Milestone 151 is unbuilt**, so every option here that composes with a notification composes with
  something that does not exist yet, and the spike should say what it assumes about it.

## What the fourth shape costs, measured

Built as a throwaway scaffold on 2026-09-05, gated green with `script/test` (205 passed, 69 skipped,
all three ISAs plus the OVMF leg), and **deleted**, which is milestone 106's own pricing method and
its reason: shipping it would settle a syscall-surface fork by accident. Full method and error bars in
`notes/timer-capability.md`.

| what | figure |
|---|---|
| the `Object` variant | **free.** `size_of::<Object>() == 24` and `size_of::<Cap>() == 32` still hold with `Timer(u64)` added, because `PageFrame(u64, NonZeroU64)` is already the widest arm. Zero bytes per slot, per capability table, per TCB |
| `ipc_fastpath` | **unchanged on all three ISAs** (7,028 / 5,936 / 8,122). An IPC round trip fetches what it fetched before |
| `syscall_entry`, flat | aarch64 **+12 B** (+0.8%), riscv64 **+158 B** (+8.6%), x86_64 **+96 B** (+5.9%). One more `Object` arm in `invoke`, measured with `#[inline(never)]` already applied to both method bodies |
| kernel symbol bytes | aarch64 **+738 B** (+0.073%), riscv64 **+2,266 B** (+0.224%), x86_64 **+1,386 B** (+0.144%) |
| per-tick bookkeeping | **not re-measured.** `notes/timed-wait.md` already has it: one comparison per idle tick, +30/+31 instructions, and a per-thread `deadline: u64` at zero bytes |

**What it assumes about milestone 151, which is item 4 of the brief and is a finding rather than a
footnote.** The scaffold signalled a `Rendezvous`, because that is what exists; §101's whole argument
is that a notification is *its own object*. If 151 builds that, the byte figures barely move and the
syscall's meaning does. More importantly: **the fourth shape is not independently useful.** Milestone
106's title ("wake on either a message or a deadline") is met only by §101's TCB binding, so without
151 this buys a thread a timer it can block on and no way to block on a timer *and* a message at once,
which is 106's actual complaint. The fourth shape is 151 plus one object, and it should be priced that
way.

## Follow-on

- **Decision.** `design/decisions/147-a-timer-a-userspace-service-cannot-hold.md`, **Status: PROPOSED**, its section number provisional like every global name a lane touches. calef's call, and it is the one this spike was minted to force. His 2026-09-05 decision was
  to serve the timed wait from a **userspace timer service**; that service cannot exist on riscv64, so
  the decision needs re-making. Three options, no recommendation, because a syscall-surface change is
  his under §10 and §16:
  1. **The fourth shape** (`Timer::ARM(deadline, notification)`), priced above and cheap. The kernel
     owns the comparator on every architecture, which is where two of three put it anyway, and the
     authority to wait on time stays a capability. Costs a syscall-surface addition and depends on
     milestone 151.
  2. **A userspace service on aarch64 and x86_64 only**, with riscv64 carrying a scope note under §19.
     This is the option §19 exists to make expensive, and it is worse than it looks: the riscv64 gap
     is permanent rather than a port that has not been done.
  3. **Reopen milestone 51's three shapes**, which this spike does not price and `notes/timed-wait.md`
     does.
- **Milestone 151.** Unblocked in the sense that it is now on the critical path rather than beside it:
  every surviving option above composes with a notification object, so 151 is a prerequisite of the
  answer rather than an enhancement to it.
- **Recorded.** `design/decisions/139-cycle-counter-authority.md` says *"There is no precedent in this
  tree for a per-thread system-register bit maintained across a context switch."* Milestones 229 and
  237 built one, so that sentence is stale inside its own decision, in the same way §102's per-slot
  arithmetic went stale inside §102. Amending a `DECISIONS` section is not a lane's (AGENTS.md), so it
  is recorded here and in `notes/timer-capability.md` for whoever owns §139 next.
- **Recorded.** xenon's HPET. Nothing in this tree records whether the machine this project owns
  has one, how many comparators, or whether the legacy replacement route is on. It needs the
  first-light photograph transcribed or the boot tour re-run with the table list captured, and it
  decides nothing until option 2 above is live.
- **Recorded.** The aarch64 refutation is a specification reading, not an experiment. Setting
  `CNTKCTL_EL1.EL0PTEN`, having an EL0 program write `CNTP_CVAL_EL0`, and seeing INTID 30 arrive is
  perhaps an hour and would turn it into a measurement. It was not run.
