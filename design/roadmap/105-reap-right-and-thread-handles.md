# 105. The two forks milestone 22 named and left

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Raised 2026-08-04. Milestone 22 (trusted init) built the supervision tree
and, in `notes/trusted-init.md`, recorded two questions it deliberately did not answer, both marked
"calef's call, not a thing to slip in". **This block's job is to state them precisely enough to be
decided, not to pick.** Both are kernel-surface changes; one is also a rights-model change.

**Gate: DECISION.** **One of the two halves was already decided when this block was written, and
that is recorded here rather than quietly fixed.** Fork one (whether reclamation and construction
are separable rights) is [§32](../decisions/32-reap-without-build.md) (a supervisor may collect a
corpse without being able to build one), decided 2026-07-29, six days before this block was raised,
and shipped as `abi::rendezvous::REAP`, whose authorization is the supervision relationship rather
than the rights bit this block proposes. So the block restated a settled question as open, and a
gate saying `DECISION` for an answered reason spends an architect's attention on a decision already made.
What remains is fork two, whether a tid becomes a handle, which is
[§164](../decisions/164-resolving-a-tid-a-supervisor-holds.md) (whether the kernel resolves a tid it
already sent), written up 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's lane. Both were recorded in
notes/trusted-init.md as "calef's call, not a thing to slip in", and fork two still is.

## Fork one: a reap-only right, split out of `WRITE`

**The fact.** `Untyped::DESTROY` needs `WRITE` on the region, and so does `RETYPE`. One right
authorizes both reclaiming a dead child and constructing a new one.

**What that forces today.** A root supervisor able to restart a dead tier-one server would be a root
supervisor able to build processes, which is precisely the authority milestone 22 set out to give
away. So `root_supervisor` chooses to be *unable* to build, and its policy for a dead tier-one server
is "report and stop". The note calls this "the fail-closed floor pushed as high and as small as it
goes", which is honest about it being a floor rather than a design.

**The shape of the change.** Either a new rights bit below `WRITE`, or a distinct `Untyped::REAP`
method that needs less than `WRITE` does. A supervisor holding it could recover a dead child without
regaining construction authority, which is the property the supervision tree wants and cannot
express.

**What to decide.** Whether reclamation and construction are genuinely separable rights or only
look it. The case against is that reaping a region hands its pages back to an allocator the holder
can then draw from, so the separation may be narrower than it reads. That is the question, and it is
a rights-model question, so it is settled in `design/decisions/` before any code.

## Fork two: `Tcb::NAME`, or a tid that becomes a handle

**The fact.** The kernel's fault message names the dead thread by tid (§26.5). No method turns a tid
into something a builder holds. So `sub_server_supervisor` names instances by a handle the *spawner*
issues instead, which works because the tree runs one sub-server at a time.

**Why it does not generalize.** A supervisor with several children receives a tid and cannot say
which child it belongs to without a mapping the kernel could supply and does not.

**Three options the note records, none chosen.**

1. **`Tcb::NAME`.** Small, and it discloses nothing new: the tid is already in the fault message, so
   turning it into a handle reveals no fact the supervisor did not receive.
2. **Per-child fault endpoints.** Rejected once already by §26.5, because synchronous rendezvous
   means `RECV` blocks on one endpoint, so this costs a supervisor thread per child or a wait-any
   primitive that does not exist.
3. **The builder reports the tid it created.** No kernel change at all, and it makes the supervision
   relationship depend on a userspace protocol between builder and supervisor rather than on
   anything the kernel guarantees.

**What to decide.** Whether the kernel owes a supervisor the ability to resolve the identity it
already sends, or whether that is userspace bookkeeping. Option 3 is free and option 1 is a method;
the argument for 1 is that a supervisor which trusts a builder's report is trusting a party it may
be supervising.

## Scope note

**These are one milestone because they arrive together and separately.** Both come from the same
build and both bite the same consumer, a supervisor with more than one child, which is what
milestone 23 (the component OS with live replacement) is. Neither depends on the other, so a
decision on one does not commit the other.

**No implementation is proposed here on purpose.** CLAUDE.md's rule is that a method not fitting the
established model is a design fork raised before it is built, and a rights-model change is further
out than that. The deliverable of *this* block is the statement; the deliverable of the milestone is
whatever calef decides plus its `design/decisions/` entry.

## Index row

A reap-only right split out of `WRITE`, so a root supervisor can restart a child without regaining
construction authority; and `Tcb::NAME`, turning a tid the kernel already sends into a handle a
builder holds. Both recorded as "calef's call, not a thing to slip in", so this block states them
precisely enough to be decided and picks neither
