# 209. A session starts in a fit state, or says which part is not

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Minted 2026-08-31 by calef, after a day in which the machine slept twice and
killed two lanes mid-response, the `launchd` watchers were found unloaded, and the toolchain link
pointed into a worktree about to be pruned. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**Gate: NONE.** Every check it makes is a command that already exists; what is missing is anything
that runs them together and says which one is false.

**In brief.** Several things must be true for work to proceed safely, and each is currently checked
by somebody remembering. calef, 2026-08-31: *"Shall we make it a standard to caffeinate when a
session is started... Seems like maybe that should be built into a program of some sort."*

This is the operational half of what `script/catch-up` already does for information. That script is a
computed view of what changed; this is a computed view of whether the machine is fit to work in.

## What it checks, and every one of these failed today

| | what goes wrong | how it was found today |
|---|---|---|
| **Sleep is held** | an unattended lane dies mid-response and its uncommitted work is one prune from gone | two lanes killed in an hour; a 138-line enumeration and a real `rmle` overflow bug were untracked when it happened |
| **The watchers are loaded** | the queue stalls and trunk goes red with nobody assigned | `launchctl list` was empty five days after the plists were installed to make remembering unnecessary |
| **`nife-dev` points at the main checkout** | pruning a worktree breaks the toolchain account-wide, surfacing far from the cause | it pointed into a lane's worktree that was about to be pruned |
| **No leaked QEMU** | emulators accumulate and hold `target/nifefs.img`, failing unrelated tests | AGENTS.md records eleven leaked over one day, 729% CPU |
| **No unclaimed lane branch** | two lanes can take one milestone | three of five lanes today pushed a branch and opened no draft pull request |
| **Disk and load headroom** | the 2026-07-31 zero-bytes incident; today's OOM | load hit 83 on eight cores with three lanes and a mutation sweep |

## The distinction that decides the design

**Machine-scoped things belong to `launchd` and this script only verifies them.** `merge-drain` and
`trunk-health` already work that way and were right to; the script must not start them silently,
because loading a `launchd` job is a machine-global act and a session should not take one without
saying so.

**Session-scoped things are this script's to hold.** `caffeinate` is the clear case: holding sleep
forever on a laptop is wrong, and holding it while lanes are running is right. That is a property of
the session rather than of the machine, which is exactly why it does not belong in `launchd` next to
the watchers.

## What it must not do, and each of these has bitten

- **Never kill a QEMU it finds.** AGENTS.md's rule is to walk `ps -o pid,ppid` **upward** first,
  because a QEMU whose parent chain ends in a live harness is somebody's gate in flight; the
  maintainer killed a lane's mid-suite emulator this way on 2026-08-15. **Report, never reap.**
- **Never relink `nife-dev` while a gate is running.** That is the same race in the other direction,
  the one that took the link out from under a lane on 2026-08-04. Detect and refuse rather than fix.
- **Never start a second `caffeinate`.** Check the assertion (`pmset -g assertions`) rather than the
  process, since a timed one from elsewhere may already be holding it and will expire.
- **Never load a `launchd` job silently.** Say it is unloaded and how to load it.

## The rung it should reach

A script is rung two: it fires only when run. **The thing that makes it fire without anybody
remembering is a `SessionStart` hook in `.claude/settings.json`**, checked into the repository, which
is rung one for the sessions this project actually runs in.

That is worth doing and is not sufficient on its own: the script must stand alone for a person at a
prompt, for another tool, and for a machine that is not calef's. The hook is how it gets invoked, not
what it is.

## BUGS

- **This is operational hygiene and is on no fatal risk's path.** It buys back attention and prevents
  losses; it moves none of the nine.
- **A preflight that reports six things nobody reads is worse than none.** The output has to be
  silent when everything is fine, which is `merge-drain`'s own posture, or it becomes noise within a
  week.
- **It cannot check the thing that actually costs most**, which is whether a lane is committing as it
  goes. Twice today uncommitted work survived only because a worktree did.
- **The name is provisional.** calef names things, and this one is awkward: it both reports and acts,
  so it sits between `script/`'s noun-shaped reporters and its verb-shaped doers.
