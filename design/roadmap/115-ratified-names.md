# 115. The names that were ratified, and the ones that were refused

**Status: BUILT** 2026-08-04 (pull request #116, merge `d1e6b1e9`). Raised 2026-08-04 by calef, asking
whether anything tracked the names he had ratified. Nothing did, and the same day produced the evidence
for why it should. The status read `IN-PROGRESS since 2026-08-04, a developer holds it on
milestone/115-ratified-names` for thirteen days after that merge; found 2026-08-17 by the
status-accuracy sweep. §76's defect class, and the sharpest instance of it in this sweep, because
`script/roadmap` was listing 115 under `IN-PROGRESS` and under "ready to start" at the same time.

**All of it landed.** Provenance lives at the name: a `Name:` block in 55 crates, 58 programs and 35
script entry points, 148 in total, which is complete coverage rather than a sample.
`script/names --check` verifies every one of them carries a block, and `script/lint` runs it. The
table is a derived query (`script/names`, with `--unratified`, `--refused`, `--unrecorded`,
`--provisional` and a bare-name lookup) rather than a file anyone maintains, which is the half calef
rejected the first draft over. The convention is notes/naming.md:223.

**The worklist's length is the mechanism working, not a shortfall.** `script/names --unratified`
stands at 74 of 148. The gate deliberately checks that a name carries provenance and never that its
state is `ratified`, because a gate keyed on ratification would hold every unrelated merge behind a
review nobody can hurry; `unrecorded` is a truthful answer and passes. Draining the worklist is
calef's, on his own clock, and was explicitly out of this milestone's scope.

**Extended since, which is what a live mechanism looks like:** `design/decisions/89` added
`provisional` as a fourth state on 2026-08-16, implemented at `script/names:252`.

**The incident.** A lane proposed `system_builder` for the crate milestone 96 extracted; the
maintainer endorsed it; calef overruled it to `system_initializer`. Only afterwards did the
maintainer find that **milestone 63 had already refused `system_builder`**, for a reason neither had
located: `user/src/builder.rs`'s own header calls itself "a minimal init: the system builder", so two
programs would claim one phrase. The refusal was recorded in one table cell inside one milestone
block, invisible at the moment it was needed. A blind rename then swept the old name out of that very
row, and the record of the refusal was nearly destroyed by the rename it should have prevented.

**The refusals are the valuable half**, and today produced six worth keeping: `job_killer` (claims an
authority the program is specifically denied), `system_bootloader` (claims a position in the boot
sequence it does not occupy, and milestone 88 will need the real one), `script/sanitize` (reads as
*input* sanitization in a project about confining hostile input), `script/brief` (collides with
briefing a developer, a term of art this tree minted the same afternoon), `caretaker` for the steward
role (spent on capability-narrowing programs), and `Watcher`/`Project Manager` for the same role
(both understate a delegated merge authority). None of that is written down anywhere a future
proposer would look.

**The deliverable, and its first draft was wrong in an instructive way.** That draft proposed one
ratified-names table in notes/naming.md. calef rejected it on 2026-08-04 for scaling like the
original `design/roadmap.md` and `DECISIONS.md`, which is exactly right and is the third instance of
that pattern in three days. Size is the smaller half; the **conflict shape** is the real one, since
every lane that adds a name would edit the one file, which is what produced three §-number
collisions in a day. The fix is the one this tree reached twice the same afternoon: **do not
maintain a record, derive one.**

1. **Provenance lives at the name.** A crate's `lib.rs` header, a program's module doc and a
   script's comment block already say what the thing is; each gains a line saying when its name was
   ratified and what was refused. `job_undertaker` carries why `job_killer` was refused;
   `crates/system_initializer` carries why `system_builder` was. That is this project's own
   posture, the reason beside the thing, and it fixes the failure that prompted the milestone:
   a refusal is most useful to whoever is about to propose the same name, and that person is reading
   the file where the name would go, not a registry.
2. **A lint checks presence, never content.** Every crate, program and `script/` entry point carries
   a provenance line or the build fails: 42, 54 and 27 today. Adding a name touches exactly one
   file, so two lanes naming two things cannot collide.
3. **The table is a query.** `script/names` (provisional) collects the lines into the view a reader
   wants, computed rather than maintained, so it cannot drift from the tree. Same family as
   `script/roadmap`, `script/decisions` and `script/catch-up`.
4. **The maintainer writes the provenance at ratification**, in the same commit that applies the
   name, when the alternatives are still in mind. A convention, so it is calef's to land in
   CLAUDE.md.

Refusals of names that were never adopted anywhere (`caretaker` for the steward role, `Project
Manager` for the maintainer) belong where that thing is defined, which for the roles is CLAUDE.md
and already says so.

## The three states, and the worklist they produce

calef will work back through the existing names over time (2026-08-04), so the record has to hold
*which ones still want him* rather than only what is known. A provenance line therefore carries a
state, and the three are different claims:

| State | Means |
|---|---|
| **unrecorded** | nothing in the tree or its history says why this name was chosen |
| **recorded** | the history explains it (milestone 63's table, a commit, a header) but calef never ruled |
| **ratified** | calef ruled, with the date and what was refused |

**The lint gates on a state being present, never on it being `ratified`.** Otherwise the gate would
demand a review queue be drained before anything else could merge, which is the wall this milestone
must not build. The mechanical backfill therefore lands every name as `unrecorded` or `recorded`,
truthfully, and the tree goes green immediately.

**`script/names --unratified` is the worklist**, and it is the deliverable calef actually asked for:
what is left, in an order worth working through. Sort it by **exposure**, because that is what makes
a wrong name expensive: programs a person types at a prompt first, then crates (a newcomer greps
`crates/` before they open anything else, per the naming tenet), then `script/` entry points, then
the rest. Within a tier, `unrecorded` before `recorded`, since a name nobody can justify is a worse
risk than one whose reasoning merely lacks a signature.

**Ratifying is then a conversation with a queue behind it**, a few names at a time, in the shape that
worked on 2026-08-04: the maintainer brings a name with what the thing does and what the history
says, calef rules, the state and the reason land in the same commit. Roughly fifteen names went that
way in one day, several of them improved by the ruling, so the rate is not the problem; the
accounting was.

**This section was written in another session and sat on an unmerged branch**
(`roadmap/milestone-115-ratified-names`) while the milestone was built without it, so the first
implementation shipped two states rather than three. That is this project's own "nobody reads
branches" rule proving itself at its own expense; the branch was deleted once this landed.

## Scope note

**Not a rename pass.** Nothing in the tree changes name because of this milestone; the backfill
records what is already true, including names that predate the tenet and were never explicitly
ratified (say so in the table rather than inventing a ratification). Where the history does not say
who chose a name or why, the honest entry is that it is unrecorded, which is itself a finding about
how much of the tree's vocabulary arrived unexamined.

The lint's blind spot, stated up front: it can check that a name is *in* the table, never that the
table's reason is still true. That is the same limit `script/decisions --check` records about
citations, and milestone 97 is the neighbouring case.

## Follow-on

- **Refused.** Draining `script/names --unratified`, which stood at 74 of 148 when this landed. The
  gate deliberately checks that a name carries provenance and never that its state is ratified,
  because a gate keyed on ratification would hold every unrelated merge behind a review nobody can
  hurry. Working back through the list is calef's, on his own clock, and was explicitly out of
  scope.
- **Refused.** A rename pass. Nothing in the tree changes name because of this milestone; the
  backfill records what is already true, and a name whose history says nothing is entered as
  unrecorded rather than given an invented ratification.
- **Recorded.** `design/roadmap/115-ratified-names.md` states the lint's blind spot up front in its
  scope note: it can check that a name carries a provenance line, never that the line's reason is
  still true.
- **Decision.** `design/decisions/89-provisional-versus-unrecorded.md` settled whether a name a lane
  minted and nobody has ruled on is the same thing as a name whose history says nothing. It is not,
  and `provisional` became a fourth state on 2026-08-16, implemented at `script/names:252`.
- **Milestone 97.** The neighbouring case this block's scope note names: the same blind spot in the
  decisions check, where a citation can be verified for naming something that exists and never for
  naming the right thing.
