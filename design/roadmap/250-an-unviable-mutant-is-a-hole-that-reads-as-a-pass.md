# 250. An unviable mutant is a hole in the measurement that reads as a pass

**Status: NOT-STARTED.** Minted 2026-09-03 by calef, from milestone 246's (measured boot's refusal
path is tested by nothing, and one mutant turns it off) handoff. *(Number provisional until the merge
queue lands it.)*

**Gate: NONE.** `cargo mutants --list` already reports what this needs.

**In brief.** Milestone 246 moved measured boot's refusal decision into `measured_boot::verdict` and
tested it. Then it found something nobody was looking for: **`cargo mutants` had never mutated that
function at all.**

The tool's only operator on a function returning a struct is to replace the body with
`Default::default()`. `Verdict` had no `Default`, so the mutant did not compile and was scored
**unviable** rather than missed. The crate could have reported a perfect score while the tool said
**nothing whatsoever** about the one decision in it that says whether unmeasured code may run.
Deriving `Default` turned it from *1 unviable, 0 tested* into **1 caught**.

**That is the shape worth sweeping for**, and it is worse than a missed mutant. A missed mutant is
visible: it appears in the report, it lowers the score, somebody argues about it. An unviable one
leaves no trace in the number at all, so a crate's score is silently computed over a smaller function
than the reader believes.

## Why the ledger does not currently catch it

notes/mutation-testing.md accounts for **missed**, **equivalent** and **hang**, and does not account
for unviable at all. Nothing in any published rate distinguishes *"no test could kill this"* from
*"the tool could not build it"*, and the second is not a fact about the code under test.

`measured_boot` alone had **nine** unviable mutants, and one of them was hiding the crate's only
security decision.

## What to do, and the cheap version is most of it

1. **`cargo mutants --list` per crate, counting unviable**, which is one command and needs no run.
2. **Read them.** The question for each is whether a small, honest change to the code under test makes
   the mutant both buildable and meaningful. `Verdict` deriving `Default` is the worked example, and it
   is a good one because the default is simultaneously the fail-safe value and exactly the dangerous
   wrong answer: an absence where there was a refusal.
3. **Put the count in the ledger**, so a published rate carries how much of the corpus the tool could
   not reach.

## The proof that this milestone worked

**An unviable count per crate in notes/mutation-testing.md**, and at least the highest-stakes ones
read and dispositioned: made viable, or recorded with the reason they cannot be.

Not a lower unviable count on its own, which could be bought by deleting code the tool struggles with.

## BUGS

- **Making a mutant viable can be gaming.** Deriving `Default` on a type where the default is
  meaningless would add a mutant that any test kills, raising the score and proving nothing. The test
  is whether the default is a value the code could plausibly be wrong with, which is a judgement
  rather than a rule, and each one should say why it is not gaming.
- **This is a property of `cargo mutants`**, whose pinned version is in `.cargo-mutants-version`. A
  tool upgrade can change which mutants are viable, and the count is therefore versioned rather than
  absolute.
- **It says nothing about functions the tool generates no mutants for at all**, which is a different
  and larger hole: milestone 246's block already records that `system_initializer::measured` gets no
  mutants and that "no mutants generated" is a property of the tool rather than a proof.

## Evidence arriving before the milestone ran: `uefi_loader`, 2026-09-04

From the `maintainer/uefi-loader-mutants` lane, which was sent at that crate's score and was asked to
report its unviable count. Recorded here rather than in a second proposal, because it is this
milestone's question with one worked instance in it.

**One unviable mutant in the crate, and it was hiding the same shape as `Verdict`:**
`uefi_loader::image::parse`'s `Ok(Default::default())`, unbuildable because `elf::Elf` has no
`Default`. The symptom this milestone predicts showed up in full: **nothing in the tree called
`parse`**, so there was no test for the tool to have failed, and the function had been silently
outside the measurement since it was written.

**It was dispositioned as "cannot be made viable", and that is a second worked example the milestone
needs.** Step 2 above asks whether a small honest change makes the mutant buildable and meaningful.
Here the default is meaningful (an `Elf` with no segments is exactly the dangerous wrong answer, so
it passes this block's own anti-gaming test), and the change is still refused: `Elf` is a validated
token whose contract is that an `Ok(Elf)` has nothing left to check, and a `Default` impl makes an
unvalidated one constructible by every consumer in the tree. That is rung one run backwards, bought
for one mutant on a two-line `map_err` wrapper.

**So the disposition list wants a fourth entry beside "made viable" and "recorded with the reason":
covered by a test standing where the mutant would have stood.** `parse` now has two callers in its
own suite, one asserting exactly what `Ok(Default::default())` would violate (the accepted image
comes back carrying its segments and its entry). The hole in the *measurement* is unchanged and is
recorded; the hole in the *suite* that it was hiding is closed.

**And the crate turned up a hole of a different kind that this block's BUGS section already gestures
at.** 154 of `uefi_loader`'s 189 mutants were in a `[[bin]]` behind `required-features`, which the
host build never selects, so cargo-mutants scored every one MISSED in "0s build + 0s test". That is
the reverse of an unviable mutant and just as invisible: not a mutant the tool could not build, but a
mutant it never built anything for. `script/lint` now derives that exclusion from `cargo metadata`.
Worth knowing when this milestone sweeps, because the "0s build + 0s test" string in cargo-mutants'
output is the tell for both, and neither leaves a mark in the rate.

See notes/mutation-testing.md's 2026-09-04 section for the numbers.
