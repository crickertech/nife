# 571. The x86 boot calibrates the TSC once, and can be wrong by 4x

**Status: BUILT** 2026-09-21. The boot times several 10 ms PIT windows instead of one, keeps the
smallest, stops as soon as two of them agree, and prints the worst beside the chosen one so a
calibration the host fought is visible rather than silently confident.
*(Renumbered from the lane's provisional 526 on 2026-09-22: a concurrently merged lane had taken
526 for a riscv64 ACPI host, and this proposal had meanwhile been promoted to 571 on main. 524 onward was contested between in-flight
branches.)*

Inside `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/timer.rs`. No syscall surface, no wire format, no dependency.

**x86_64 only by nature, and not a parity gap.** Under §19 (architectural parity is a tenet; the
targets are aarch64, riscv64, and x86_64): aarch64 reads `CNTFRQ_EL0` and riscv64 reads the
device tree; both are architected statements of the rate, so neither has a calibration that could
be wrong. This is the one
architecture that has to *measure* the clock everything else is measured against, which is what
`timer.rs`'s header has said since the port landed.

## The defect, which another lane found while looking for something else

Milestone 524 (the three x86_64 boot gates: NX, SYSCALL, and the invariant TSC) had just argued
that a non-invariant TSC "cannot be caught by measuring harder". The `tscdrift` lane then went to
check whether TCG's TSC drifts at all, built an RTC-referenced probe, and found that it does not:
the counter ticks at exactly 1000.000 MHz, constant to within 42 ppm whatever the host is doing.

What it found instead was that the number the boot **writes down** had almost nothing to do with
that. Twenty-two boots of one binary stored 1001 MHz to 4330 MHz. This lane widened that to 490
boots at three host loads and the shape held without a single exception: **every boot high, none
ever low.**

`init_frequency` armed PIT channel 2 for a 10 ms one-shot and polled port 0x61 until the output
line went high, reading the TSC either side. Polling can only ever notice the terminal count
**late**, and the entire elapsed TSC delta was then attributed to exactly 10 ms. One descheduling
of the QEMU thread inside that window inflates the answer without bound: a 4330 MHz reading is a
43 ms window reported as a 10 ms one, and the worst this lane saw, +1153%, is a 125 ms one.

**The error being one-sided is the whole of the fix.** Every window is an *upper bound* on the true
rate, so the minimum of several is the tightest bound taken, and it converges on the truth from
above. An average would be a biased estimator for precisely the reason the minimum is an unbiased
one: it carries every descheduling into the answer instead of discarding it.

## calef's ruling named the shape; the count was measured

> "Fix the calibration with min-of-five windows." (2026-09-21)

The brief for this lane said not to take five as given, and that was the right instruction: **five
would have been the wrong number to ship.** Two hundred boots on a host deliberately saturated to
load 30 on eight cores, each timing sixteen windows and reporting every one, give the error of the
min over the first k of them:

| Windows | Median error | 99th percentile | Worst of 200 | Boots wrong by >1% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (what shipped) | +0.36% | +884% | **+1153%** | 56 / 200 |
| 3 | +0.00% | +120% | +131% | 24 / 200 |
| 5 | +0.00% | +20.6% | +51.4% | 11 / 200 |
| 9 | +0.00% | +0.49% | +7.1% | 2 / 200 |
| 16 | +0.00% | +0.01% | **+0.47%** | **0 / 200** |

Five still leaves one boot in eighteen wrong by more than a per cent and a worst case of +51%. The
tail only closes at sixteen. **The median is +0.00% at every count from three upward, which is why
reporting the worst case rather than the mean was the instruction that mattered**: by the mean, the
defect was fixed at three windows and had never been very bad at one.

The load matters and is stated rather than hidden. At ordinary session load one window's worst of
30 boots was +773%, and min-of-9 got to +0.01%; at load 22 the same estimators gave +318% and
+0.34%. The table above is the hardest condition measured, which is the one a cap should be chosen
against.

## Sixteen windows would be a 160 ms boot tax, so it is a cap and not a count

Ten milliseconds per window is real time on every boot, including every CI test boot, and the suite
boots repeatedly. Paying it sixteen times when three would do is the kind of cost that gets noticed
later and reverted by someone with less context.

So the loop stops as soon as **two windows agree to within one part in a thousand**, and the
reasoning is the one-sidedness used the other way round. A window is inflated by a descheduling,
an event of essentially arbitrary size; for two windows to land within a thousandth of each other
they must both have been left alone, because two independent deschedulings agreeing to three
decimal places is not a thing that happens. **Agreement is evidence of cleanliness**, and once
there is evidence the remaining windows buy nothing but boot time.

Measured over the same 490 boots, this reaches **exactly** the accuracy of taking the full cap
every time, boot for boot, at a mean of:

| Host | Mean windows timed | Mean calibration cost |
|---|---|---|
| Ordinary session load | 3.53 | 35 ms |
| Busy (load 22) | 4.77 | 48 ms |
| Saturated (load 30) | 5.20 | 52 ms |

**calef's five is what this costs; sixteen is only what it is willing to spend when the host is
fighting.** That the measured mean on a saturated host came out at 5.20 is a coincidence and is
recorded as one.

A tighter tolerance (one part in 2000) moved the mean by 0.07 windows and the error distribution
not at all, which says the choice is not delicate: clean windows agree to within the PIT's own
quantisation and dirty ones are nowhere near.

### The measured boot cost, stated plainly

`script/test --arch x86_64` boots the kernel **four** times, and those four boots took 3, 3, 4 and
3 windows. So the suite pays **90 ms** more than the one-window design did, against a 3m38s
runtime: **0.04%**, an order of magnitude below the suite's own run-to-run variance. That is a
computed figure and deliberately not a measured delta, because there is nothing to measure a 90 ms
change against.

## Was there a better reference than the PIT? Asked, and the answer is no, twice

**`CPUID` leaf 0x15** states the TSC's ratio to a core crystal whose frequency leaf 0x16 may give,
and where it exists it is strictly better than any measurement because it is the part stating its
own rate. `arch::x86_64::isa::tsc_crystal_hz` already reads it and `init_frequency` already prefers
it. That path is milestone 161 (the x86_64 kernel port: bring up the HAL's third architecture)'s
work and this lane changed nothing about it. It is empirically unavailable here: QEMU's TCG does
not offer the leaf under any invocation tried, which is why every boot in this tree takes the
calibrated path. **Nothing to do; the better reference is already
preferred and the machine declines to provide it.**

**The CMOS RTC** is the harder question, because it is the reference `tsc_probe` uses and it is
genuinely independent (QEMU drives it from `QEMU_CLOCK_HOST`, host wall time, rather than from the
vCPU). It is a better *check* and a worse *calibration source*, and the reason is resolution. Its
seconds register has one-second granularity, so calibrating against it means either waiting for a
seconds edge (up to one second of boot, a hundred times this fix's cost) or reading it as a time
and accepting a one-second error. `tsc_probe` gets its precision by watching for an **edge** and
then spanning thirty-two seconds, which is fine for an instrument that runs once on demand and
absurd for every boot. Worse, the edge wait has the same one-sided polling error this whole section
is about, so it would need the same min-of-N treatment on top of costing a hundred times more.

So: **the PIT stays, and it stays because it is the only fixed-rate device on a PC that can be
timed in ten milliseconds.** The RTC's role is the one it already has, as the independent reference
that says whether the PIT calibration was right.

## What is in the diff

- `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/timer.rs`: the loop, the cap, the stopping rule, a `Calibration` record
  (**provisional name**) that keeps every window rather than discarding them, and a rewritten
  `BUGS` section. The old "one calibration, no averaging" bullet is gone, replaced by two that are
  true now: what this still does not bound, and what it costs in boot time.
- `kernel/src/main.rs`: the boot line prints `best of N windows, worst M MHz`. This is the part
  that is rung three of AGENTS.md's ladder rather than rung one: nothing can *make* a host leave
  the vCPU alone, so the next best thing is that a calibration the host fought stops being
  invisible.
- `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/timer_calibration_tests.rs`, new: five tests of the stopping rule fed
  sequences by hand, and two boot assertions (several windows were timed; the stored rate is the
  smallest of them). Its header says why they run under QEMU rather than on the host, which is that
  `timer.rs` compiles only for `x86_64-unknown-none` and there is no second consumer to justify
  moving the rule into a crate.
- `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/tsc_probe.rs`: prints every calibration window, which is what turned the
  probe from "is the calibration right" into "is the estimator right" and is how the tables above
  were measured.
- `helpers/qemu-runner-x86_64.sh`: forwards SIGTERM to QEMU. See below; this is a separate bug that
  this lane's own sweep tripped over several hundred times.
- `notes/benchmarks.md`: the 2026-08-24 x86 `ns/iter` table is marked in place, and a new dated
  section records what the defect reaches and what it does not.

## The bug this lane tripped over on its way, and fixed

**`helpers/qemu-bounded.sh`'s bound did nothing on x86_64**, and the reason is one word in a
comment. `qemu-runner-x86_64.sh` is the only one of the three runners that does not `exec` QEMU,
because it has to translate `isa-debug-exit`'s status afterwards, and it says so. But the wrapper
bounds a run by sending SIGTERM **to the child it started**, which on aarch64 and riscv64 is QEMU
and here was the runner shell. The shell died; QEMU was reparented to pid 1 and ran forever.

This lane's calibration sweep orphaned an emulator on every boot until someone looked, and
`qemu-bounded.sh`'s own `BUGS` section named a different cause ("a SIGKILL to the killer defeats
all of it") than the one operating. The runner now runs QEMU in the background, traps TERM and HUP,
forwards them, and reaps. It also needed `qemu-bounded.sh`'s own fd-3 dance, because backgrounding
a command gives it `/dev/null` on stdin under dash and would have broken every piped-input run in
CI.

**That is a general hazard rather than this lane's**: any bounded x86_64 run in this tree, in any
lane, leaked its emulator at the bound. It is worth reading as evidence for AGENTS.md's ladder,
since the property that failed was recorded in a comment (rung three) in a file that was correct
about everything except what another file would do to it.

## BUGS

- **This is a probabilistic filter, not a bound.** The minimum is only as good as the best window
  the host allowed, so a host that never leaves the vCPU alone for ten unbroken milliseconds
  produces an inflated rate however many windows are taken. 0 of 200 boots at load 30 were wrong by
  more than 1%; that is a measured distribution and not a guarantee. The boot line's worst-window
  figure is what makes the remaining failures visible rather than silent.
- **The cap was chosen against one machine.** Every number here is patagonia, an eight-core Apple
  Silicon host running TCG. An x86_64 CI runner with KVM, or xenon, has a different descheduling
  distribution and might want a different cap. Nothing here measures that, and the promotion
  trigger is the first time an x86 wall-clock number from another machine looks wrong.
- **Nothing gates the accuracy.** The two boot tests assert the estimator is the one intended, not
  that the answer is right; checking the answer needs an independent clock, which is `tsc_probe`
  behind an off-by-default feature costing thirty-five seconds a boot. A gate would mean a
  thirty-five-second suite leg to catch a defect that fails safe, which is not a trade worth
  making today. If x86 wall-clock figures ever become something the project publishes rather than
  reads, that changes.
- **The local APIC timer's rate gets the same treatment and has no `CPUID` escape.** It is the
  minimum over the same windows, taken independently of the TSC's. Unlike the TSC there is no path
  that skips the measurement, so on a part that reports leaf 0x15 the windows are still timed.

## Follow-on

- **Recorded.** That this is a probabilistic filter rather than a bound, and that a host which
  never leaves the vCPU alone still defeats it, is a limitation stated where a reader meets the
  feature: `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/timer.rs`'s `BUGS`, beside the constant that sets the cap.
- **Recorded.** That the cap was chosen against one machine (patagonia, eight-core Apple Silicon,
  TCG) and may want a different value on a KVM runner or on xenon is in this block's `BUGS` and in
  `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/timer.rs`'s. The promotion trigger is the first x86 wall-clock figure
  from another machine that looks wrong.
- **Recorded.** That nothing gates the calibration's *accuracy*, only its estimator, is in
  `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/timer_calibration_tests.rs`'s own `BUGS`, with the reason (an accuracy
  gate costs a thirty-five-second suite leg to catch a defect that fails safe).
- **Done.** The proposal this promotes,
  `design/roadmap/proposals/the-x86-boot-calibrates-once-and-can-be-wrong-by-4x.md`, is removed by
  this milestone: its two open questions are both answered above (the boot does print its
  confidence, and the local APIC timer is derived from the same windows).
- **Recorded.** `helpers/qemu-bounded.sh`'s `BUGS` section still describes SIGKILL as the way its
  bound is defeated, and does not mention that a runner which does not `exec` defeats it with an
  ordinary TERM. The x86_64 runner is fixed here and now says so at the code; the wrapper's own
  `BUGS` is the place a reader would look first and is left for whoever next touches that file.

## Index row

**Built:** 2026-09-21

The x86 boot measured the TSC against a single 10 ms PIT window and stored the result for the life
of the boot, and that number was wrong by up to **+1153%** against a counter known to tick at
1000.000 MHz, high on every one of 490 boots and never low, because a poll can only notice the
PIT's terminal count late. Everything time-derived on x86 read it: `bench --x86 --real`'s ns/iter,
`Instant`, `uptime`, `coremark`'s self-reported rate. This milestone takes the smallest of several
windows instead, which is the right estimator precisely because the error is one-sided, and stops
as soon as two windows agree to one part in a thousand, so the mean cost is 3.5 windows on a quiet
host and 5.2 on a saturated one against a cap of sixteen. calef's ruling said five; five was
measured and found to leave a +51% worst case, which is why the cap is sixteen and the five is what
it spends. The worst window is now printed beside the chosen one, so a calibration the host fought
is visible rather than silently confident.
