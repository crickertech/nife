# 536. Two records still say the prover cannot see `kernel/src`, and it has been able to since 2026-08-30

Built 2026-09-25 (UTC) by the maintainer, under calef's ruling of that day
recorded as §216 (fatal-risk facts are correctable, and verdicts are the architect's). Risk
2's stale sentence and size are corrected in `design/fatal-risks.md`, its appendix
`design/fatal-risks/proofs-and-their-reach.md`, and `notes/proof-retrospective.md`, each correction
dated and citing its source; PR #1276 had already corrected `script/verify`'s header. Risk 2's
status and colour are unchanged, because §216 leaves them with calef. The line counts below are this
block's 2026-09-20 measurement; the corrections carry the 2026-09-25 re-measure (86,528 lines,
15,966 in files calling `asm!`, eight harnesses). *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)* Promoted from the proposal `the-unreachable-kernel-claim-is-three-weeks-stale`, filed 2026-09-20, on calef's instruction of 2026-09-20 to give every proposal on `main` a number. The text below is the proposal's own, unedited except for this paragraph and one bold lead-in the prose ratchet refused: the argument is its author's and promotion is not the moment to improve it. Raised by the `maintainer/verus-versus-kani` lane, which was briefed
on the claim and found it expired before it found anything else.

The gate was DECISION until §216 answered it on 2026-09-25. Its reasoning, as proposed: `design/fatal-risks.md` is calef's file and risk 2's text is his to amend;
AGENTS.md puts the falsification list outside a lane's reach, and the edit to it by the lane for
milestone 64 (enough `std` to run somebody else's crate) is recorded as an exception rather than a
precedent. `notes/proof-retrospective.md` is an ordinary
note and needs no decision, but the two say the same sentence and should be corrected together or
the reader meets a tree that disagrees with itself.

## The claim

`design/fatal-risks.md` risk 2 (the proofs prove trivia, and the real bugs live where Kani cannot
reach), verbatim:

> **The cause is one line of `script/verify`'s own header**, verified rather than inferred:
> *"`cargo kani -p <crate>` never compiles the kernel, the user programs, or xtask."* So **64,818
> lines of `kernel/src` are out of reach by construction**, and that is exactly where every
> concurrency, hardware-contract and resource-accounting defect lived.

`notes/proof-retrospective.md` carries the same sentence, which is where risk 2 got it.

## Why it is wrong now

Three milestones landed after it was written:

- **Milestone 193 (put `kernel/src` within reach of the prover, because today the proofs cannot see it)**,
  2026-08-30. Four changes, three of them one-line `cfg`s.
- **Milestone 255 (a quarter of `kernel/src/arch/` has no assembly in it, and none of it is proved)**,
  2026-09-04. Two harnesses inside `arch/aarch64/iommu.rs`.
- **Milestone 304 (`cargo kani -p kernel` only ever compiled one architecture, and it was the runner's)**,
  2026-09-16. Two harnesses inside `arch/x86_64/irq.rs`, and a second verify host.

`notes/kernel-proofs.md` is the record and this lane re-ran it. Six kernel harnesses exist; four run
on any given host. **`script/verify`'s header line is itself stale** and is the root of both copies.

## What the corrected claim looks like

The reach is now bounded by three things rather than by the crate, and this lane measured each
(`notes/verus.md` has the commands and the verbatim tool output):

| what stops a harness | how it fails | scale |
|---|---|---|
| a call graph reaching `asm!` | loud: `TerminatorKind::InlineAsm is not currently supported by Kani`, and it reaches through a *dependency* (`aarch64-cpu`) | **15,001** of `kernel/src`'s 81,413 lines are in files containing an `asm!` call, and every one is under `arch/` |
| a fixed-address MMIO read | loud: `dereference failure: invalid integer address` | the rest of `arch/` |
| an architecture the host does not compile | **silent**: `no harnesses matched the harness filter` | two of three subtrees per run; `riscv64`'s is compiled by nothing anywhere |

So the honest sentence is narrower and better: **DECISIONS §4 (kernel shape: monolithic, deferred,
with two cheap rules) rule 1, architecture-specific code under `kernel/src/arch/`, has held the
unreachable residue to under a fifth of the kernel, and it is exactly the fifth you would expect.**
Both defects risk 2 leans on, the timer re-arm drift from milestone 6 (threads, the context switch,
and preemption) and the VisionFive 2 undelivered wake, are still on the far side of it, so **the risk's
colour does not obviously change**; what changes is that the cause is two Rust constructs rather than
a crate boundary, and that the fix is writing harnesses rather than moving a wall.

`64,818` is also stale as a size. `kernel/src` is 81,413 lines today, 40,953 of them non-blank
non-comment.

## What is blocked until it is answered

Nothing is blocked. This is a correctness problem in the record, and the reason it is worth a
proposal rather than a passing mention is the one AGENTS.md states: a lane briefed from a stale
premise spends its budget discovering that, and this one did. The next lane sent at risk 2 will do
the same.

## What this does not propose

Not that risk 2 should go green. It should not, on this evidence: no Kani harness in this tree
has still ever caught a defect after the day it was written, which is the finding, and reach was
only ever half of the explanation for it. See `notes/verus.md`, which asked whether a different
verifier would extend the reach and found that it stops at the same boundary.

## Follow-on

- **Milestone 432.** Proving `arch/riscv64/iommu.rs` from an aarch64 host, which PR #1276 priced.
  Milestone 432 (the RISC-V IOMMU driver has no counterpart to the SMMU's proofs) built it 2026-09-25. Whether the corrected facts move risk 2's verdict was put to calef in PR #1282,
  and he ruled the same day to keep AMBER and reword the red half.

## Index row

Risk 2 said `cargo kani` never compiles the kernel for three weeks after milestone 193 made it
compile. The fatal-risks entry, its appendix and `notes/proof-retrospective.md` now state the reach
as measured: `asm!`, fixed-address MMIO and an uncompiled `arch/` subtree, not a crate boundary.
