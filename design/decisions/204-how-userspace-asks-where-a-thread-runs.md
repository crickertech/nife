# 204. How userspace asks where a thread runs

calef, 2026-09-21. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*
Raised while unblocking the job-mix supervisor's move to userspace, which needs a placement census
from a userspace supervisor. (That milestone's block is not yet on `main`, so it is named here
rather than cited; the citation lands when it does.) The question grew past that: it is how **any** per-thread fact reaches userspace, and it
**amends §150 inside the window §150 itself left open.**

## What was decided

**Two mechanisms, because there are two different questions.**

1. **Observing another thread is a selector.** `abi::rendezvous::SURVEY` takes an argument naming
   which record the caller wants, and returns that record's words. A new fact is a new selector
   value, not a new register.
2. **A thread observing itself is a per-thread page**, on the shape Linux's `rseq` uses: the kernel
   writes the current CPU into a small per-thread structure the thread reads with no syscall.

## What this overturns, and why that is on purpose

§150 (how does a thread's CPU time reach userspace?) ruled sub-choice 3, *"a widened `SURVEY`
return, not a second method ... a fourth carries the figure"*, and flagged it as the irreversible
one: *"the moment to overturn it is before milestone 282 ships, not after."* Milestone 282 (a
thread's CPU time, and the `top` it makes possible) is NOT-STARTED, so this is that moment, used as
designed. **The ruling that CPU time is tick-sampled, per-thread and scheduled on-CPU time stands
untouched**; only how it reaches a reader changes, from the fourth word to a selector record.

## Why, and the deciding fact was a forecast rather than an argument

The register row could hold five words with no new mechanism, and appending one is the fewest moving
parts **if the row stops**. calef's answer was that he expects a third and a fourth fact, which
decides it: a mechanism that must be redesigned at the sixth field is the wrong mechanism at the
fourth.

**The comparable systems agree and were read rather than recalled:**

| system | per-thread facts | mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Linux, `/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/stat` | **52 fields**, `(39) processor` being *"CPU number last executed on"* | a page-backed pseudo-file |
| Zircon | 4 topics on a thread, ~11 fields, of **41** `ZX_INFO_*` topics | `zx_object_get_info(handle, topic, buffer, size)`, a selector |
| macOS, `thread_basic_info` | ~8 | a fixed record |
| seL4 | none; no thread enumeration exists | by design: the supervisor built the threads |

**Nobody grows a register row.** And Zircon's `zx_info_thread_stats_t` holds `total_runtime` **and**
`last_scheduled_cpu` in one struct, which is this decision's two fields already living together in
the system closest to nife's shape. Fuchsia also needed a governance RFC (RFC-0084) whose purpose
was adding more fields to a runtime record, which is the third and fourth arriving in someone else's
tree with paperwork.

## Why the selector rather than a domain-wide statistics page

A shared page mapped into a supervisor was the other candidate and was refused, for reasons that are
this project's own rather than general:

- **It is ambient authority.** An invocation checks `ENUMERATE` at the moment of the call; a mapped
  page keeps answering after the capability is revoked, unless revocation also walks mappings. Two
  lanes spent 2026-09-21 on exactly that class (a capability parked in a hand-off slot surviving a
  sweep, and `map_physical` never recording its mapping). Creating a second authority that outlives
  its capability, to save a syscall, is the wrong direction for the claim this kernel is a
  demonstration of.
- **The side channel goes from polled to continuous.** §150 weighed a polled aggregate leak and
  accepted it; a tick-updated page is a different magnitude and would need re-arguing.
- **Slot reuse yields plausible wrong data.** A dead thread's slot is reused, and a reader sees a
  well-formed number belonging to a different thread, absent generation counters. calef's ruling the
  same day, on the counter frequency, was that a wrong number is worse than no number.
- **A fixed table caps how many threads a domain can expose**, which is the ceiling the selector was
  chosen to remove.
- **It is prover-hostile** where risk 2 is already weakest: a lock-free structure with a concurrent
  writer and reader under the weak ordering rule 4 tells us to assume.

**And the speed it buys is below the noise floor of its consumer.** An IPC round trip measures
**~705 ns** (debug-build QEMU numbers, so an upper bound), and a `SURVEY` is one syscall, cheaper
than a round trip. Sixty-four threads at a 1 Hz refresh is about **45 microseconds per second**,
roughly 0.005% of a core.

## Why a page is nonetheless right for the self case

The high-frequency consumer is real, and identifying it is what separated the two mechanisms: a
memory allocator keeping a per-CPU cache reads *its own* CPU on **every allocation**. That is
`rseq`'s reason for existing, and Linux made it a memory read rather than a syscall because the
vDSO path is x86-specific and **impossible to implement on AArch64**; the memory approach measured
20x faster on x86 and 35x on ARM.

**That consumer wants one thread's own CPU, not a table of everyone's**, so it carries none of the
objections above: no slot reuse, no table cap, and the page is the thread's own.

## What is not decided here

- **Affinity.** Whether a program may *choose* where its threads run is seL4's position and remains
  open. calef's reading, 2026-09-21: placement could be a userspace program that gets smart about
  it. Placement at thread creation is cheap and works today; re-placing a running thread needs
  migration, which this kernel does not do and seL4 deliberately refuses, and that is a question the size of
  §96 (process kernel or event kernel) rather than a feature.
- **A push mechanism for a profiler.** Sampling at 1 to 4 kHz wants the kernel to push into a ring
  buffer rather than anyone to poll. Named here so a later reader does not mistake the selector's
  scope for it.

## BUGS

- **Two mechanisms are more to learn than one**, and the tree owes a reader one sentence, where they
  meet either, saying which question the other answers.
- **The selector's record layouts are still wire formats.** This decision moves the growth problem
  from registers to records; it does not abolish it. Each new selector value is as expensive to
  un-ship as a fourth word would have been, and the gain is that adding one requires no change to
  what an existing reader already parses.
