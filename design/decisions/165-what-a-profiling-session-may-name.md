# 165. What a profiling session's grant names

**Status: PROPOSED.** Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's lane, which found milestone 147 gated on
`MILESTONE 75, DECISION` naming no decision, when the prior question its gate defers to has been
answered since 2026-09-02. [§139](139-cycle-counter-authority.md) (who may read the cycle counter,
and by what authority) took it; 147's gate never said so, and §139's own text says it does **not**
cover what 147 needs. *(Section number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

## What §139 settled, and why 147 is still owed a decision

§139 chose a **per-thread grant enforced at the context switch**, with the grant a field in the
spawn manifest rather than a method on a live thread. It considered milestone 147 explicitly, and
declined to let it argue for the live form:

> 147 wants *this profiler may read that subtree's counters*, which is cross-thread authority with a
> named target, and neither shape here provides it.
>
> -- design/decisions/139-cycle-counter-authority.md

So the prior question is closed and the second consumer's question is untouched: §139 grants a
thread the right to read **its own** counter, and a profiler wants to read **somebody else's**.

## What is being decided

**What a profiling session's grant names, and whether cross-thread counter reads exist at all.**
Three parts:

1. **The target.** A subtree, a single thread, or nothing (the profiler can only read itself).
2. **The counter set.** One counter, or a set named at grant time.
3. **Whether the set is discovered rather than assumed**, since some silicon does not report the
   events a session would want to name.

## Why this is a stronger claim than "disabled by default"

Every HPC profiler surveyed reads counters through host-OS ambient authority. `perf_event_open`
targets any pid the caller's privilege reaches, gated by `perf_event_paranoid` (a **global sysctl,
not a per-target grant**) or `CAP_PERFMON`, which is a capability in name and "root, or nothing" in
practice. A profiling tool with that access on a shared node can in principle sample a neighbouring
tenant's job, which is why `perf_event_paranoid` exists and why HPC centres frequently run it at
`-1` for exactly these tools.

**The independent confirmation matters because it is not ours.** Brown, *RISC-V for High Performance
Computing* (CUG '25, ACM 3757348.3757367) names immature profiling tooling as a high-priority action
item for the whole RISC-V and HPC community, and attributes it partly to hardware: *"the hardware
events that are made available by RISC-V CPUs."* That clause is why part 3 above is in this decision
rather than in the implementation.

## What this tree already does in the analogous case

**Narrowing by subtree is built and is the model.** `rendezvous::SURVEY` (milestone 126) walks
exactly the supervision subtree whose fault endpoint this is, needs no second bookkeeping, and is
authorized by the same relationship `REAP` is ([§32](32-reap-without-build.md), a supervisor may
collect a corpse without being able to build one). A `ps` launched from a shell sees the shell's
children and nothing else. **A profiler is the same shape with a different verb**, which is the
strongest argument available here: the kernel already maintains the relation the grant would name.

**And discovery-rather-than-assumption already has a pattern.** Milestone 74's `Isa` is built at
boot by probing what is present rather than assuming a fixed catalogue. A counter-set capability
should name only the events the running silicon reports, and a probe for an unsupported event should
refuse cleanly rather than read zero.

## The options

| | what the grant names | cost |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Nothing new.** A profiler reads its own counters under §139's per-thread grant and no more. | Free, already built, and refuses the feature: a profiler cannot profile a job it did not become. |
| **B** | **A single target thread.** | Smallest cross-thread authority. A profiler of a multi-threaded job needs one grant per thread and has no way to follow a thread it did not know about. |
| **C** | **A supervision subtree**, the `SURVEY` relation with a counter set attached. | Matches what a profiler actually wants, reuses a relation the kernel keeps, and `caps <profiler>` can print exactly which processes it may read. Adds cross-thread reads, which §139 deliberately did not open. |

**Recommendation: C, with the counter set held from day one.** Milestone 74's scope note refused to
become a profiling framework *"for a second consumer"*, and this is that second consumer arriving on
schedule. Holding a **set** rather than one counter from the start is the restraint 74 was saving:
it costs nothing now and avoids redesigning the type the day a second event is asked for. The set is
a capability's contents, never an ambient enable bit.

**What C costs, stated rather than implied**: cross-thread counter reads are a larger side-channel
surface than one thread reading its own, and §139 closed that door on purpose. Opening it for a
profiler is a real widening and should be ruled as one rather than inherited.

## How reversible it is

**The grant shape is surface and is not reversible.** What *is* reversible is the ordering: A is
the current state and costs nothing to keep while the answer waits.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Milestone 147**, and its demonstration: two confined workloads on one board, a profiler holding a
capability over one of them, and a negative control where it is refused at the type level on the
other.

**Not blocked, and worth separating so they do not get tangled in**: the sample-reporting wire
format, whether sampling or counting is the first mode (sampling needs an overflow interrupt path
nothing here opens), and multi-node aggregation, which this system has in no form.

**And the side-channel argument is from the literature, not from this board.** Whether a confined
nife process can distinguish a neighbour's cache behaviour through any channel this kernel leaves
open is a claim milestone 43's audit lens should aim at, and neither 147 nor this decision attempts
it.
