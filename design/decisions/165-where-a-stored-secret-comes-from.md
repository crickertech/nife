# 165. Where a stored secret comes from on a boot that is not a test

Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's lane, which found milestone 131 gated on
`DECISION` with no decision anywhere a reader can open. The block has carried the fork with four
options and no recommendation since it was filed, and says outright that *"the choice is calef's,
it is a fact that leaves the machine."* *(Section number provisional until the merge queue lands
it.)*

## Two questions, because the block's subject was removed under it

1. **Where a secret physically comes from on a real boot.** This is the fork, and it survived the
   removal of the thing that motivated it.
2. **Whether milestone 131 is re-aimed or retired**, which the block says is calef's and which no
   record answers.

## Why question 2 exists

**The subject was removed on 2026-08-30.** Milestone 131 was about configuring an SMB share and
provisioning its secret, and calef decided that day to remove the SMB implementation
(`notes/smb.md`). Two of its four deliverables went with it: per-resource credential endpoints for
the SMB adapter, and the boot that stops admitting guests to the share.

**Two did not, and they are not about SMB.** The configuration document generalizes to any service
that is a set of compile-time constants today. And the provisioning path is a gap in the credential
service whoever its clients are: nothing in this tree can tell a running system a secret, and the
only provisioner is a test program carrying a published fixture.

So the block is half a milestone with no name for its state. Its own status line says as much:
*"The status word is unchanged because the vocabulary has no word for a block whose subject is gone,
and minting one is calef's."*

## Question 1: the options, with what each costs

Milestone 56 built the store and the entropy. What is missing is the path **into** it on a boot
that is not a test.

| | where the secret comes from | cost |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Typed at a console.** | Honest, needs no new authority, and matches how a person expects to set a password. Requires an interactive boot to reach the credentialer, and cannot serve a machine that boots unattended. |
| **B** | **Read from a separate device** (a USB key, a second partition). | Works unattended. Moves the question rather than answering it: the secret is now at rest somewhere this system does not control, and "who may read that device" is a capability question of its own. |
| **C** | **Provisioned at image build.** | Simplest, and what the test path does today. The secret is in the image, so **the image becomes the secret** and every copy of it is a copy of the password. |
| **D** | **Bound by measured boot**, sealed to the measurement milestone 22 already takes. | Strongest and largest. Needs a sealing story this tree does not have, and fails closed in ways that are hard to recover from at 2am. |

**No recommendation, and that is deliberate rather than an omission.** AGENTS.md says to recommend
on reversible forks and to give options on irreversible ones, and a secret's resting place is the
irreversible category by its own definition: it cannot be un-decided by deleting code. The block
made the same call when it was written and it still holds.

**What can be said without deciding it** is that A and C are not alternatives on the same axis. C is
what the tree does today and is a known defect rather than a candidate; A is the smallest thing that
is not that. Whether B or D is needed is a question about whether an unattended boot is in scope,
which is a different question and should be answered first.

## What this tree already does in the analogous case

**A secret is already an endpoint rather than a value.** [§41](41-endpoint-as-broker.md) (the
endpoint is the broker) settled that the thing handed to a program is the right to ask, not the
material. [§111](111-inert-config-is-a-validated-page.md) (inert configuration is a read-only page)
then split what Unix puts in one environment map into three, and routed secrets to §41's broker
explicitly rather than letting them ride on a page. So the **shape** of what a program holds is
settled; this decision is only about how the material reaches the broker in the first place.

**The credential store's refusal to be updated is also considered rather than accidental.**
`credentialer::Store::put` offers no replacement because *"put twice, second wins"* has a race in
it, and `credential_protocol::provision::SEAL` says that after it the store cannot be changed short
of restarting the service. Any provisioning path has to arrive before the seal, or argue with it.

## How reversible it is

**Question 1 is the least reversible thing in this file**, and it is worth separating the two halves.
Choosing wrong is recoverable by choosing again. Having *run* the wrong one is not: a secret that was
in an image is compromised in every copy of that image, forever, and no later decision retrieves it.

**Question 2 is cheap.** Re-aiming a roadmap block or retiring it is a text edit, and AGENTS.md's
*move fast on what can be undone* says to decide it quickly rather than deliberate it.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Milestone 131, both halves.** The configuration-document half could be built against any service
today and is not blocked by question 1; it is blocked by question 2, because nobody knows whether
this block is the place for it.

**Not blocked:** the fixed port and the guest-writable demo share, which have no subject left. And
the parser caution stands whatever is decided: a configuration document read from anywhere but the
image is a new parser reading attacker-adjacent bytes, and should be host-tested and fuzzed on day
one rather than after.
