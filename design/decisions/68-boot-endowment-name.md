# 68. `BootEndowment::unused` wants a truer name: it is `for_test_roles`

calef, 2026-08-15: **`for_test_roles`**. Refused `not_ours`, and the
refusal sharpened the rule: "ours" is caller-relative, which is the same one-seat viewpoint bug
`unused` had with the sign flipped; both callers read one struct, so the name must state whose
the capabilities are absolutely. Refused `test_roles_only` for bolting an adverb onto a noun.
`for_test_roles` is the possessive instinct this entry always had, made absolute, and "roles"
earns its length because 19d's test roles is the greppable term of art. Renamed the same day.

**What.** The field holds the capabilities aarch64's boot path is handed because it shares that path
with milestone 19d's test roles: a report endpoint and a test SGI. The interactive system never uses
them and deletes them with the device authority.

**The problem.** They are not unused. The test roles use them. "Unused" is true only from the
interactive system's point of view, which is one of the two callers.

**Options.** `not_ours` (states whose they are, from the caller's side); `test_roles_only` (states
whose they are, absolutely); leave `unused` and let the doc comment carry the nuance.

**Recommendation.** Something possessive. The field's whole job is to say "these arrived for someone
else", and a name that says so removes the need for the reader to hold the doc comment in mind.

**Blocked.** Nothing. Cosmetic, and cheap while `crates/system_initializer` is one day old.
