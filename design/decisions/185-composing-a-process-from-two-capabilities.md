# 185. What carries the claim that userspace composes a process from an authority you can count on one hand

**Status: PROPOSED.** Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice-c lane, which found milestone 404's
`DECISION` gate naming no section. The gap was opened deliberately by milestone 295, performing
calef's ruling to retire `components/src/builder.rs`, and that lane recorded it rather than closing
it. *(Section number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

## What is being decided

`builder` carried two claims wearing one sentence, and retiring it kept one.

**Userspace, not the kernel, composes a process.** Carried by the progenitor, on every architecture
that runs one, on the boot a card performs. Better off than it was.

**...from an authority you can count on one hand.** `builder` held **exactly two** capabilities, a
memory region in slot 0 and a report line in slot 1. The progenitor does not: it is also granted the
NS16550 and the UART's interrupt line, because it is building a system rather than demonstrating a
floor. **This is the half that lost its only carrier**, and the decision is what carries it now, or
whether it should be carried at all.

## Is the premise true

Checked 2026-09-19 in this worktree, and it is, on all three legs:

- `fixtures/src/address_space_witness.rs` exists and holds the **same two capabilities**, retypes an
  address space, retypes a page frame, maps the frame into the space it built, and proves the kernel
  enforces break-before-make inside it. `kernel/src/user/tests.rs:3022`
  (`a_process_can_build_an_address_space_from_el0`) asserts the verdict on both architectures whose
  test kernel can load a user ELF, under `script/test`, on every pull request.
- `kernel/src/user/tests.rs:2706` (`a_process_can_build_start_and_run_a_child_thread`) drives the
  whole sequence and the child runs and reports, on both architectures. It is a **kernel-side**
  test: it calls `memory_region::create`, `user_address_space_map`, `configure` and `start`
  directly, not through `ecall`/`svc` out of a granted budget.
- Nothing joins the two.

**So the gap is a join rather than a hole**, and saying it that precisely is what makes option (a)
look as small as it is. `address_space_witness` stops where milestone 19b stopped, because threads
were 19c's object; the verbs past that point are all proved, from the other side of the boundary.

**And the coverage is better than it was**, which is why this is a proposal rather than an alarm: no
pull-request check has ever executed `builder`, because `script/test`'s riscv64 leg,
`script/cpu-matrix`, `script/shell-check`, `script/bench --riscv --check` and `script/icount` all
park before the tour (milestone 406).

## What this tree already does in the analogous case

**A claim gets a carrier that runs on every pull request, or it is prose.** That is §97's posture
and milestone 406's whole complaint one subsystem over. `builder`'s failure was not that it was
wrong; it was that the only thing exercising it was a boot no check performs, so a step nothing
asserts and a step nothing needs produced identical evidence, which is what cost milestone 289 a
lane.

**And a floor is proved by holding it, not by describing it.** `crates/grant_plan` reasons about
what a *shell* grants; nothing in this tree reasons about what a *composer* needs to hold.

## The options, priced

| | what | cost |
|---|---|---|
| **(a)** | extend `address_space_witness` to run something in the space it builds | an afternoon. Same two capabilities, same fixture, more verdict bits, asserted on every pull request, which is where `builder` never was |
| **(b)** | a new fixture that composes a child from two capabilities and nothing else | an afternoon plus a name. Honest about being a second thing; costs one more program in every archive, which milestone 206 (a program image has under 896 KiB) is the standing reason to be careful about |
| **(c)** | prove it host-side: a crate that takes the verb sequence and the capability set and decides whether the set suffices | a week. Kani-reachable, runs in milliseconds, and the only option producing a *proof* rather than a demonstration. It does not witness the kernel actually permitting the sequence, which is the thing `builder` witnessed |
| **(d)** | decide the claim is not worth a carrier | a sentence. The kernel enforces the floor on every call, 19b proves it does so inside a space a process built, and a demonstration is not evidence a model checker would accept |

## Recommendation

**(a)**, and the one thing in it that is not a lane's is why this section exists rather than a
commit: **the fixture's name would stop describing it.** `address_space_witness` witnesses an
address space; a fixture that also starts a thread in it witnesses something larger, and a rename is
a naming decision with extra steps, which AGENTS.md puts squarely with calef.

The second cost of (a), stated so it is chosen rather than discovered: **milestone 19b's clean
"nothing can run in the space it built" reading goes away.** That reading is currently a fact a
reader can check in one file.

**(d) is legitimate and belongs on the list** rather than being allowed to lose by default. Its real
cost is that a demonstrator loses the one boot step a stranger could read and immediately
understand, which is what `builder` was for.

## Would we still choose (a) if all four cost the same

Mostly yes, and the honest exception is (c). If a week were free, (c) produces a proof where (a)
produces a demonstration, and this project's direction (§14) values the first more. (a) wins on
cost *and* on witnessing the kernel rather than a model of it, so the recommendation does not rest
on effort alone, but (c) is the option that a bigger budget would change.

## How reversible, and who has acted on it

**High.** A fixture and its verdict bits; nothing two programs agree on. The name is the one part
that lands in a reader's head, which is the standard reason it is not a lane's.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Nothing.** The tree is no worse off than it was the hour before `builder` was deleted, because
nothing on a pull request ever ran `builder` either. This is recorded so the risk milestone 295
accepted stays visible instead of becoming the kind of fact that lives only in a merged pull request
body, which is what `notes/untracked-work-sweep.md` exists to name.
