# 86. Whether an NVMe driver can leave the kernel, and what capability would let it

**Status: PROPOSED.** Raised by milestone 53's storage lane (2026-08-15, pull request #193), which
built the NVMe driver kernel-resident and stopped exactly here, correctly: the alternative needs
new syscall surface, and that is a boundary a lane does not cross (§10, §16).

## What is being decided

Every other DMA driver in this tree runs at EL0 behind a `Virtio` capability: the kernel owns the
queue addresses, parses each descriptor on its way to the device, and refuses any address outside
the driver's DMA region. That checkpoint exists because virtio's descriptors pass through a
doorbell path the kernel mediates.

NVMe has no such point to stand on. The controller fetches 64-byte commands directly out of
driver-written memory, and the DMA targets (the PRP fields) ride inside those commands. Nothing
kernel-side sees a command on its way past, so the `Virtio` capability's design does not transfer;
a confined EL0 NVMe driver needs a different contract. The question: does the NVMe driver stay in
the kernel, or does the syscall surface grow whatever lets it leave?

## The options

1. **Stay kernel-resident, with the IOMMU as the whole confinement story.** This is what is built.
   `bring_up` confines the controller's requester id to its six-page DMA region before enabling it,
   and on both `virt` machines an unconfined controller cannot fetch its first command, so
   forgetting the confinement fails loudly. The cost is architectural: the driver joins the TCB,
   against the microkernel thesis that drivers are user programs (§21, §23 spent real work getting
   virtio out).
2. **A kernel-owned admin plane.** The kernel keeps the admin queues (queue creation names physical
   addresses; that is the dangerous authority) and hands EL0 a capability to a pre-built I/O queue
   pair whose rings and data buffers all live inside the driver's own confined DMA region. The
   IOMMU bounds every fetch and every transfer to that region, so the kernel never parses commands;
   it only guarantees the geometry inside which any command is harmless. This is the `Virtio`
   capability's *shape* (kernel owns setup, EL0 owns the data path) with the IOMMU replacing
   per-descriptor validation.
3. **Delegate the whole controller.** Map BAR0 into the driver and let the IOMMU alone bound it,
   admin queues included. Simplest surface, but the driver can then re-point queues anywhere inside
   its region and the kernel cannot name which pages are rings versus data; and BAR0 contains every
   doorbell including the admin pair, so revocation semantics get murky. Recorded because someone
   will propose it, not because it is recommended.

## Recommendation

Option 2, **but not yet**. The recommendation is to hold this PROPOSED until the board-side work
(the JH7110's PLDA XpressRICH root complex, tracked as milestone 163, NOT-STARTED) exists, for the
same reason §23 built multi-queue confinement only after single-queue worked: the second data point
tells you which parts of the contract are QEMU artifacts. A second, possibly faster path to the same
data point may exist through milestone 87's x86 machine instead; see milestone 163's own text for
why that does not make 163 unnecessary. Option 1 is honest in the meantime because the limitation is recorded
in notes/nvme.md's BUGS section rather than implied away.

If the answer is option 1 permanently, nothing is blocked, and notes/nvme.md's BUGS entry becomes
the standing record. If it is never decided, the driver silently becomes load-bearing kernel code,
which is how a microkernel stops being one; that is the failure this entry exists to prevent.

## What is blocked until it is answered

- An EL0 `nvme_server` program (the block-server shape `fs_proto::blk` already speaks).
- `block_roster` growing an NVMe transport kind (the surveyor cannot list the NVMe disk today);
  small, but its wire shape depends on who owns the controller.
- Milestone 55's storage stack picking its final backend: it can benchmark against the
  kernel-resident driver meanwhile, and those numbers stay honest if they are labeled with it.
