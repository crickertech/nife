# 89. `provisional` becomes the fourth provenance state

calef, 2026-08-16: **option 1**, a fourth state. `script/names` accepts
`provisional`, `script/names --provisional` lists them, and they sort first in `--unratified`
because a name its own author has called wrong is the shortest conversation available.

The reason option 1 beat the cheaper ones is milestone 115's own: **a backlog a machine can list
is a backlog that gets worked**, and the alternatives put intent back into prose or into a lane's
report, which is where naming decisions were dying before that milestone existed. `provisional`
is also the word AGENTS.md already uses in four places, and a mechanism that spells its rule
differently from the person who wrote the rule is a mechanism people get wrong, which is exactly
how this defect was found: a newcomer wrote what the file told them to and the gate refused it.

**The cost, accepted with eyes open** and worth restating because the entry named it: a lane can
now write `provisional` forever and never confront that nothing recorded its reasoning. What
answers that is the sort order rather than a rule: `provisional` is first in the worklist, so it
is the state most likely to be resolved rather than the state easiest to hide in.

**The states remain orthogonal in principle** (a name can be recorded and still provisional) and
this deliberately does not model the cross product, because nothing in the tree has needed it.
`script/names`'s own comment says so where the list is built.

**What happened, verbatim.** A newcomer added a program, read AGENTS.md's repeated instruction that
a lane "ships a **provisional** name and says so", wrote exactly that in the program's provenance
block, and `script/names --check` refused it:

```
names: program doubler: the block must start `ratified <date>` or `unrecorded`
       (found '**provisional**. Introduced 2026-08-16 while wal')
```

**The clash.** Milestone 115 gave the tree three provenance states, and they are machine-checked:
`ratified <date>`, `recorded`, `unrecorded`. AGENTS.md, in four separate places, tells a contributor
to ship a *provisional* name. Both are right about their own subject and they do not use the same
word for it, and only one of them is enforced. Two programs in the tree already work around it by
writing `unrecorded, and explicitly **provisional**`, which is the tell: a workaround appearing twice
is a convention forming in the dark.

**They are not quite the same idea, which is why this needs a ruling rather than a `sed`.**
`unrecorded` is a claim about the *record*: nothing outside this block says why the thing is called
that. `provisional` is a claim about *intent*: whoever chose it expects it to change. A name can be
`unrecorded` and settled (nobody wrote down why `hello` is called `hello`, and nobody needs to), and
a name can be recorded and still provisional. The states are orthogonal, and the tree currently
spends one word on both.

**Three ways out.**

1. **A fourth state, `provisional`,** accepted by `script/names`. Honest about intent, and it makes
   the naming backlog a query: `script/names --provisional` is the list calef would actually work
   from. Cost: another state to explain, and a lane that writes `provisional` forever never has to
   confront that nothing recorded its reasoning.
2. **AGENTS.md adopts the gate's word** and says "ship it as `unrecorded`, and say in your report
   that the name is provisional". Cheapest, no code, keeps three states. Cost: it puts the intent
   back into a report, which is rung four, and reports are exactly where milestone 115 found naming
   decisions going to die.
3. **Keep both words and make the block carry both**, which is what the two workaround programs
   invented: the state stays `unrecorded` and the sentence after it says provisional. Formalize it in
   `notes/adding-a-program.md` and in the gate's error message. Cost: the intent is prose, so nothing
   can query it.

**The recommendation is 1**, and the reason is milestone 115's own: a naming backlog that a machine
can list is a backlog that gets worked, and one that lives in pull request reports is the thing that
milestone existed to abolish. `provisional` is also the word calef already uses, and a mechanism that
spells its rule differently from the person who wrote the rule is a mechanism people get wrong.

**If it is refused**, option 3 is the fallback and costs almost nothing: the tree already does it
twice, and writing it down turns a workaround into a convention. Option 2 is the one to avoid, since
it is the only one that moves a fact *out* of the artifact and into a report.

**Blocked on nothing.** `notes/adding-a-program.md` now tells a newcomer to write `unrecorded` and
cites this decision, so the trap is documented either way. What this decides is whether the tree's
two vocabularies become one, and which one wins.
