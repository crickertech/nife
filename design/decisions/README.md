# nife: Architecture Decisions

*Name: ratified (§75 covers this directory). `decisions` names what the files are, one each, and the tree cites them as `§N` regardless of the directory's name; the plural is deliberate, since a singular would read as one decision about design rather than a place where decisions live.*

Decisions made 2026-07-12, before any code was written. Each entry records what we
chose, what we rejected, and why. Revisit these deliberately, not accidentally.

## How this directory works

One decision, one file, named `NN-slug.md`. The number is the identity: `§14` is
`14-project-direction.md` and nothing else, and the 2,000-odd `§N` citations spread across the
kernel, the crates, the notes and the roadmap all resolve here. GitHub renders this README as the
directory index, so browsing to `design/decisions/` shows the table below.

This was one 5,320-line file until milestone 114. Splitting it does the same three things the
roadmap split (milestone 76) did one directory over:

- **A number cannot be claimed twice by accident.** Two lanes both wrote `## 30.` into the single
  file on 2026-07-30 and it merged clean, because both sides' prose survived. As two files claiming
  one number it is a gate failure, which is what `script/decisions --check` now reports.
- **Text cannot land under the wrong heading.** §67 was appended into the middle of §61's BUGS
  section on 2026-08-03, because the insertion anchored on the string `## Reading` and the first
  occurrence of that string in the file was a wrapped prose line inside §61. Every gate reported
  clean for a day. `cat >>` into `67-second-stream.md` can only add text to §67.
- **A status flip stops being a conflict.** Marking one decision superseded used to edit the file
  every other lane was also editing.

Do not renumber. A number that moves breaks citations that no gate can see are wrong, because a
well-formed citation to the wrong section still resolves. Milestone 97 is where that check gets
built, and this directory is what makes it cheap: once a decision is a file with a title, a
citation's parenthetical name can be compared against that title.

## Status

Every decision carries a status on the line under its title, and the table below repeats it. The
two must agree, and `script/decisions --check` fails if they do not.

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| `PROPOSED` | Raised, not yet decided. Options and a recommendation are in the file; nothing is built on it, and nothing should cite it as settled. Waiting on calef. |
| `DECIDED` | It holds as written. |
| `AMENDED` | It holds, but part of it was revised or overtaken by later work. The status line names what changed, and the amendment is in the file or in the decision it names. |
| `SUPERSEDED BY N` | A later decision replaces it. Kept, never deleted, because the reasoning is the record: §8's deferral was correct and §10 is what it deferred to. |

`AMENDED` is the token that pays for the vocabulary. Eleven decisions carry a revision that a reader
of the opening paragraph would otherwise miss, and §26 is the sharpest: its first line still says
"not yet built" while three blocks below it record milestone 22 building it. Nothing flagged that,
because a decision had no status to contradict.

**A decision waiting on calef is `PROPOSED`, and it lives here rather than in a queue of its own.**
`design/open-decisions.md` was that queue for one day, and it existed for a good reason: a decision
that lives only in a conversation's scrollback is in the medium milestone 94 was written to abolish.
But a proposal is the same object one lifecycle step before `DECIDED`, with the same shape (what is
being decided, the options, the recommendation and its reason, what is blocked until it is
answered). So it gets a file and a number when it is raised, and answering it flips a status in
place instead of moving text between two systems. Numbers 68 to 73 are the six that queue held.

Two blocks that lived among the decisions are not decisions and moved out with the split, the same
way milestone 76 moved four essays out of the roadmap: [the open design
ideas](../open-design-ideas.md), which are proposals parked against a trigger rather than choices
made, and [the original eleven-milestone plan](../original-milestone-plan.md), which the roadmap
backfilled into `design/roadmap/` and which is kept here as the record of what was planned before
anything was built.
