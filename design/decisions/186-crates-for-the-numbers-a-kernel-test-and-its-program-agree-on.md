# 186. One crate per kernel-test pair, or one crate for all of them?

**Status: PROPOSED.** Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice-c lane, which found milestone 407's
`DECISION` gate naming no section. Measured by milestone 293's lane, which reduced one instance of
this and then counted the rest. *(Section number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

## What is being decided

AGENTS.md rule 7 says anything two binaries must agree on is a crate, never a copy. Seventy-six
constants across nineteen file pairs are copies, each held in line by a `// must match` comment:
role numbers, report tags and report flag bits shared between a kernel test's wiring and the program
it spawns.

The sweep is mechanical and a lane could start it today. **What it cannot settle is the crate names,
and there is no useful half of this work that does not create one.** Two shapes:

1. **One crate per pair** (`login_test_contract`, `compositor_test_contract`, ...), which follows
   `swap_protocol`'s precedent, keeps each contract readable in one file, and costs nineteen names.
2. **One crate for all of them**, which costs one name and makes the crate a grab bag of unrelated
   numbers.

## Is the premise true

Checked 2026-09-19 in this worktree. Yes, and the tree's own counter-example is still in it:
`crates/swap_protocol/src/lib.rs:381` publishes `pub const ROLE_DIRECT: u64 = 0` with real doc
comments, and `kernel/src/user/live_swap_tests.rs:52` **re-declares it locally anyway** under a
four-word comment, alongside `ROLE_QUEUED` and `ROLE_HUNG`.

That is the strongest argument for a gate rather than a convention: **even where the crate exists,
one side was written without it.**

Milestone 407's block records an independent re-count on 2026-09-19 over `ROLE_*`, `RPT_*`, `F_*`
and `TERM_MAGIC` declared on both sides of a spawn, finding **25 kernel/program file pairs sharing
79 constant names**. That is a similar method rather than the same one, so it is not byte-comparable
with the 19 pairs and 76 names, and what it establishes is that the shape has not shrunk.

## Why a comment is not a mechanism

It is rung four of the ladder for a fact that has a rung-one answer sitting next to it. The failure
it permits is silent and specific: a role number changed on one side spawns a *different* role, and
a flag bit changed on one side makes a test assert against a bit nothing sets. **Both read as a bug
in the code under test rather than as a mismatch**, which is the same misdiagnosis
`credential_proto::fixture`'s own module doc warns about for the SMB account.

## What this tree already does in the analogous case

**The shape is built and works three times**, all of them in this worktree:

- `crates/swap_protocol` publishes the role numbers its two binaries agree on.
- `crates/job_mix` does the same.
- `crates/schedule_store` publishes the file names `session_reviver` and `fs_test_client` both
  depend on, for exactly this reason and with the reason written down.

Milestone 293 did it once more for the credential values three files were copying
(`credential_proto::fixture::PEOPLE`). **So what is missing is not a design, it is the sweep.**

**And §63 says where the seam is**: logic that needs no capability goes in the crate; anything that
moves or exercises authority stays in the program. A role number is neither logic nor authority, it
is the vocabulary the two ends share, which is rule 7's category rather than §63's.

## Why the existing protocol crates are the wrong home, which is a lookup rather than a preference

These numbers are **not part of any shipped wire contract**. Putting `login_test_client`'s six
behaviour numbers into `login_protocol` would widen the protocol a real login client is written
against with something no real client needs. `crates/swap_protocol` is not a counter-example: the
swap roles genuinely belong to the swap protocol.

## What each option costs

| | cost | what it gets wrong when it is wrong |
|---|---|---|
| **1, one per pair** | nineteen names, nineteen `Cargo.toml` entries, nineteen dependency edges | a reader meeting `compositor_test_contract` knows what it holds without opening it |
| **2, one crate** | one name | a grab bag of unrelated numbers, which §46 and naming.md's generic-name rule both push against; and every kernel test depends on every other test's constants |

**Three crate names in milestone 407's table have moved** and the work has to read the current ones:
`swap_proto` is `crates/swap_protocol`, `login_proto` is `crates/login_protocol`, and
`components/src/ntp.rs` was split into three programs by milestone 290, so that row's program side
is now `network_time_client` and its siblings.

## Recommendation

**1**, and the reason is not symmetry. Option 2's real cost is the dependency edge rather than the
name: one crate for all of them makes every kernel test's wiring depend on every other test's
constants, so a number added for the compositor rebuilds the login test, and a reader opening the
crate cannot tell which half is theirs. Nineteen small crates is more entries in a manifest and
fewer things to hold in a head, which is this tree's definition of elegance.

**Names: none proposed, and `*_test_contract` above is illustrative rather than a suggestion.**
Nineteen names at once is the largest naming batch this tree would have taken, which is a reason to
answer question 1 first and then hand the batch to `script/names` as a worklist rather than deciding
it in one sitting.

## Would we still choose 1 if both cost the same

Yes. Option 2 is the cheaper one to build (one crate, one name) and it is still the one this section
refuses, on the dependency edge rather than on tidiness.

## How reversible, and who has acted on it

**The structure is reversible; the names are not.** Merging nineteen crates into one, or splitting
one into nineteen, is a mechanical afternoon. Nineteen names land in nineteen `Cargo.toml` files, in
`script/names`' worklist and in a reader's head, and they cannot be un-taught.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Milestone 407**, entirely. The sweep cannot produce a useful half without creating a crate, which
is why the block is gated rather than ready.
