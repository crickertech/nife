# 16. Object revocation: reclaim the objects a process built (extends §13)

(two amendment blocks below, from milestones 31 and 22.)

§13 revoked **frames**. This extends the same idea to **kernel objects** (TCBs, address spaces,
endpoints), so a process can be torn back down and its memory returned, the reclamation a
run-workloads-that-come-and-go system needs. Full reasoning in notes/object-revocation.md.

## The model

**Region ownership plus generational staleness, not a capability derivation tree.** An object's
lifetime is its backing region's lifetime; reclaiming a region frees each object's registry slot, and
because objects carry generational names (§14, `crates/slots`), every outstanding capability to them
goes stale on next use with no capability to hunt. This is coarse (reclaim a region, kill every object
in it at once; no per-delegation revocation) and that is the right authority semantic here. The CDT is
a later, purely-additive layer if fine-grained revocation is ever wanted; the rework to add it is
near-zero, because the per-object teardown and region reclamation it would call are what we build now.

## The trigger, and the lock constraint that shaped it

Reclamation is explicit: `Untyped::DESTROY`, invoked by the region **owner** (who holds the untyped
cap), never automatic on thread exit, because a region belongs to its owner, not to the thread that
occupies it, and reclaiming memory is an authority a capability system grants only through a capability
held. Thread exit does the live-state teardown; the owner's destroy does the memory. `destroy` must
never take `SCHED` (it is reachable from `AddressSpace::Drop` under the reaper's `SCHED`), so the
`SCHED`-taking object reap is a separate caller-driven step and `destroy` stays `SCHED`-free.

## Two new methods on the Untyped object (the surface stays three syscalls)

- **`SPLIT`** carves a child untyped off a parent's budget (seL4's untyped-retype-into-untyped), so a
  spawner gives each child its own reclaimable region. A parent with live children cannot be destroyed
  (freeing its run would double-free a child's pages), tracked by a child count so the parent becomes
  destroyable again once its children are gone. **Return-of-pages is LIFO:** a child destroyed at the
  top of the parent's watermark gives its pages back to the parent's budget (un-bump), which is exactly
  what a spawn-then-reap loop does, so a split parent is *not* committed for its lifetime; a child freed
  out of order leaves a hole until the parent itself is destroyed. This is the LIFO half of seL4's
  return-to-parent without the derivation tree that would handle the general case.
- **`DESTROY`** reclaims a region and every object retyped from it. Refuses (NotPermitted) while a live
  thread occupies it, an endpoint in it has a blocked waiter, or it has been split.

## Also

Region indices became **generational** (`destroy` reuses the slot), retiring the old cap where the
kernel could create only 256 regions in its whole lifetime. **Endpoint revocation wakes a blocked
waiter with an error:** revoking an endpoint drains its wait queues, marks each waiter aborted, and
wakes it, so its blocking `ipc_recv`/`ipc_send` returns an error (the endpoint is gone) rather than
stranding the reclaim or dangling on a freed page. `endpoint_of` became fallible so a stale endpoint
capability fails cleanly instead of panicking; the check folds into the existing IPC locks, so the
hot path does not regress. The EL0 `lat_proc` spawn benchmark also landed (notes/benchmarks.md):
nife builds a process faster than Linux or macOS, with the honest caveat that a
capability-microkernel process is a lighter object than a Unix one.

## Amendment (milestone 31): untyped becomes delegable by rights *inheritance*, with a delegable root

`SPLIT`'s child untyped was minted with `WRITE` alone (`cap::untyped_cap`), where every other
creation path gives its creator full rights: `RETYPE` mints a frame `READ|WRITE|GRANT`, `RETYPE_OBJ`
mints an endpoint, aspace, or TCB the same. Because `SEND_CAP` and `CAP_INSERT` both gate on `GRANT`,
that under-grant silently made untyped the one object type **no process could delegate**: a split
budget could be spent by its holder and handed to no one. That foreclosed "untyped budgets as
first-class grants," milestone 31's headline: a shell that endows a child N pages from its own budget
must delegate an untyped, and could not.

**The first fix was wrong, and the way it was wrong is the interesting part.** Minting the `SPLIT`
child `READ|WRITE|GRANT` unconditionally is a *rights escalation*. `SPLIT` gates only on `WRITE`, so a
process holding a deliberately `GRANT`-less untyped (one delegated to it spend-only) could `SPLIT` it
and receive a `GRANT`-bearing child over the same memory, manufacturing the very right its capability
withheld. That violates the model's derive-never-widens invariant, and it does so at a *fresh mint*
site the Kani proofs (which cover `derive`) do not reach.

**The right fix is rights inheritance, not a rights default.** Two coordinated changes:

1. A `SPLIT` child inherits **the invoking capability's rights, never more**
   (`untyped_cap_rights(child, cap.rights)` at the mint site). A spend-only untyped splits into
   spend-only children; `GRANT` is passed down only if the parent held it. This makes `SPLIT` honor
   derive-never-widens by hand, the same discipline `derive` enforces.
2. The **root** untyped the kernel hands init at boot becomes `READ|WRITE|GRANT`
   (`cap::untyped_root_cap`, at the three init-boot grant sites). Delegating budgets to the children
   it builds is init's job, so the root of the budget tree carries `GRANT`. This was the actual bug:
   the `WRITE`-only root, not the `SPLIT` default, is what left no delegable untyped anywhere and
   forced the escalating workaround.

Rights then narrow monotonically from the root down: root (`GRANT`) -> init's `SPLIT` (inherits
`GRANT`) -> `CAP_INSERT` into the shell (narrowed to `WRITE|GRANT`) -> shell's `SPLIT` (inherits) ->
`CAP_INSERT` into the spawned child (narrowed to `WRITE`, spend-only). `untyped_cap` (`WRITE` only)
stays the constructor for a spend-only leaf budget; nothing manufactures authority at any step.

A kernel test pins the invariant at the mint site (`syscall.rs`,
`split_inherits_the_parent_capabilitys_rights_never_widening`): a `GRANT`-less untyped splits into a
`GRANT`-less child that cannot be delegated, while the delegable root splits into delegable children.
This is a bug fix to this section's intent (untyped is delegable in seL4, the model we borrow
guarantees from), recorded here rather than as a new section. See `kernel/src/syscall.rs`'s `SPLIT`
handler, `cap::untyped_root_cap`, and notes/grant-expression.md.

## Amendment (milestone 22): DESTROY force-kills a live resident thread, it no longer only refuses

`DESTROY` refused (NotPermitted) while a live thread occupied the region, on the reasoning that "its
owner must let it finish first." That is right for a cooperative child, and wrong for the exact case
§24 built the forcible tier of `^C` for: **a runaway that never finishes.** A thread spinning at EL0,
never yielding and never checking its interrupt endpoint, would refuse `DESTROY` forever, so the
shell's escalation had nothing to escalate *to*. §24 named the forcible tier "§16's revocation" and
said "no new kernel primitive"; this is the small change to `DESTROY` that makes that true.

**The refusal now arms a kill.** When `DESTROY` finds a live (`Ready`/`Running`/`Blocked`) resident
thread, it marks it `killed` and still refuses this pass. A killed thread never runs again: the
scheduler converts it to a `Finished` corpse at its **next preemption** instead of requeueing it, and
the ordinary reaper tears down its stack and address space exactly as a clean exit would. So the
owner that retries `DESTROY` (the shell's escalation loop already retries, for the exit sliver)
reclaims the region once the runaway has been torn down.

**Why a flag and a retry, not a synchronous kill.** Yanking a thread out of a run queue needs an
arbitrary-remove the intrusive `Fifo` deliberately does not have, and stopping a thread `Running` on
another core needs a cross-core IPI and a rendezvous. The killed flag needs neither: a runaway is
preemptible by construction (DECISIONS §5), so **each core converts its own killed thread on the
timer**, and the whole mechanism is one branch in `schedule()` plus one flag in `DESTROY`. The cost
is that reclamation is not instantaneous (the runaway runs to the end of its timeslice, then dies),
which is exactly the semantics the shell wants: a bounded escalation, not a stop-the-world.

**Scope, honestly.** This tears down the runaway (`Running`/`Ready`), which is §24's stated target. A
thread that only ever *blocks* is never scheduled to hit that preemption, so the flag alone will not
reap it; that case is the cooperative tier's job (send the program its interrupt endpoint, which by
definition it is listening on), not the forcible tier's. A single kernel test builds a one-instruction
EL0 runaway and reclaims its region out from under it, on both ISAs (`user.rs`,
`destroy_force_kills_a_runaway_and_reclaims_its_region`). See `kernel/src/sched.rs` (`schedule`,
`reap_region_objects`) and `Thread::killed`.
