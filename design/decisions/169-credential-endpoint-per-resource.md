# 169. Whether a `credential_protocol` verify endpoint names the identity it asks about

**Status: PROPOSED.** Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice B, which read milestone 327's
`DECISION` gate and found it naming no section. The question itself is older: milestone 54's block
posed it, `notes/smb.md` recorded it as a next step rather than as an accepted limitation, and the
2026-09-03 proposal sweep carried it forward. *(Section number provisional until the merge queue
lands it.)*

## What is being decided

One question, and it is a wire question: **does a `verify` request keep carrying the identity it
asks about, or does the endpoint become the credential for one resource, with the name implied by
which endpoint you hold?**

Today `place(&mut page, b"corinne", b"hunter2", verify::VERIFY)` puts an identity and a secret in
the shared page, so a holder of a verify endpoint chooses which record to test. The alternative is
an endpoint minted against one identity, where a caller can present a secret and cannot say whose.

## The tree as it stands, read rather than recalled

`crates/credential_protocol/src/lib.rs` fixes the layout: `ID_OFF = 0`, `SECRET_OFF = 64`,
`MAX_IDENTITY = 64`, `MAX_SECRET = 256`, `LAYOUT_LEN = 320`. The identity is *"an opaque byte string
and nothing more"*, and `place` refuses an empty one.

**The extra authority is narrower than "read the store", and the crate says so where a reader meets
it.** `MISMATCH` is returned both for the wrong secret and for an identity that is not present,
deliberately: *"Distinguishing them would turn the verify endpoint into an identity"* oracle. So
what a holder can do today is test a guess against any name, not enumerate names. That is the
honest size of the gap and it is smaller than milestone 327's block implies.

**The senders, counted rather than estimated** (2026-09-19). `verify::VERIFY` leaves exactly two
programs: `components/src/login.rs` at one site, and `fixtures/src/credentialer_test_client.rs`,
the test client, at six. `components/src/credentialer.rs` is the server that answers it, and
`kernel/src/user/credential_tests.rs` asserts the opcode-space property below. Five crates and
program trees depend on `credential_protocol` at all (`components`, `fixtures`, `kernel`,
`crates/system_initializer`, `crates/login_protocol`).

## What this tree already does in the analogous case, which is the strongest argument here

**The crate is already built on the rule this proposal extends.** `provision::PUT` and
`verify::VERIFY` are **both opcode 1**, and the module header says why in words this decision can
lean on directly: *"the endpoint gives a number its meaning, not the number itself"*, so a program
holding the verify endpoint that sends `PUT` gets `MISMATCH` rather than a refusal, because *"there
was never a privileged request to refuse"*.

So the question is not whether this tree believes an endpoint should carry authority that a word on
the wire does not. It already does, in this crate, and milestone 65 demonstrated it by collision.
The question is whether the **identity** is one of those words, or whether it is data the holder is
entitled to choose.

[§27](27-filesystem-service.md) is the argument milestone 327 cites and it is the same
shape one subsystem over. `crates/block_roster`'s header states the general form most sharply:
*"Deliberately not a handle. Holding this tells you a device exists; it does not let you touch it."*

## The options

| | shape | cost, measured where it can be |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Keep the identity on the wire.** No change. | Nothing to build. The standing cost is that a program which verifies credentials can be described only as *"it asks about its own"*, which is a promise about a branch rather than a property checkable from outside. |
| **B** | **The endpoint is the credential for one resource.** The identity comes off the request; a verify endpoint is minted per identity and the page carries a secret alone. | Two senders and one server change together (measured above). `LAYOUT_LEN` drops from 320 to 256 and `ID_OFF`/`MAX_IDENTITY` leave the wire. The real cost is on the minting side and is not priced here: something has to hand out one endpoint per identity, and `login` today resolves the identity a person types at a prompt. |
| **C** | **Both**, a narrowed endpoint kind beside the general one. | The general shape survives, so nothing is unbuilt and nothing is un-shipped; two shapes exist forever and a reader has to learn which one a given endpoint is. This tree refuses that kind of doubling elsewhere. |

**No recommendation, deliberately.** This is a contract two programs agree on, which AGENTS.md puts
in the irreversible column beside names and the syscall surface, and its own limit says a
syscall-surface decision arriving with a recommendation *"is already most of the way made"*. What is
offered instead is the premise check below, which is the thing that would change the answer.

## Is the premise true?

**Partly, and the part that is false is the part that would decide B.** Milestone 327's block says
the change is cheap now because there are four callers, and that is right as far as the *request*
goes. It does not price the minting side, and B is not a change to a message shape alone: it is a
change to who hands out verify endpoints and on what basis. `login` currently takes an identity from
a person at a prompt and asks the credentialer about it; under B it would have to obtain the
endpoint for that identity from somewhere, and that somewhere is a piece of design this block does
not have.

**The consumer that motivated it is gone.** Milestone 54's SMB adapter was deleted on 2026-08-30
with the rest of the network file service, and it was the caller configured with a resource name.
Nothing in the tree today is visibly harmed by the extra authority.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Milestone 327, and nothing else.** No other block cites it. The argument for answering it anyway
is the direction of the cost rather than a live defect: every program written against the current
shape makes B more expensive, and the next thing that authenticates anything gets written against
whatever is there.

## What this does not decide

Nothing about `provision`. The provisioning endpoint genuinely does name the identity it writes,
because minting a record is the act of naming one, and no reading of this changes that.
