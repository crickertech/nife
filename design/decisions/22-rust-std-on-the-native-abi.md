# 22. Rust `std` on the native ABI, the Hermit way (milestone 27)

(the create/truncate half of the `Unsupported` list is superseded below.)

Decided and built 2026-07-28. Full write-up in notes/std.md; this records the decision and the
forks inside it.

**The decision: implement std's platform layer (`sys`) directly on the capability ABI, not a POSIX
shim under the Unix one.** This is Hermit's shape (std on a non-POSIX unikernel ABI), which
DECISIONS §15 already priced the alternative (Redox's relibc-first road) at "later, if ever, and at
no cost to defer". A std program draws its heap from an untyped budget at slot 0, SENDs stdout to an
endpoint at slot 1, reads `Instant`/`SystemTime` from the virtual counter, and gets honest
`Unsupported` from `thread::spawn`, `fs`, and `net` until the servers that back them exist
(milestones 30 and 32). No new syscall and no new capability method: the PAL is a client of the ABI
as it already stands, the same surface `allocator_exerciser` proved. `panic!` prints and faults (panic=abort;
unwinding is never linked), which is this ABI's honest `abort()`.

**Why now:** the first wall an application hits on nife is "no std", and milestone 23's
vendor-component ambition needs components writable by people who are not kernel people. std on the
native ABI widens "runs real workloads" to most of crates.io that stays off files and sockets,
without smuggling in the POSIX assumptions (no fork, no open-by-path, no ambient anything) the ABI
deliberately excludes.

**The one genuinely new thing is build machinery, and its forks were settled by measurement, not
taste.** `-Zbuild-std` reads std's source from the sysroot of the rustc it invokes, so a patched std
means a toolchain whose sysroot is patched. Three approaches were on the table; the empirical result
chose:

- *Symlink farm* (link a fake toolchain, symlink lib, real patched src): **rejected, measured to not
  work.** rustc derives its sysroot from the resolved location of `librustc_driver`, and a symlinked
  dylib resolves back to the real toolchain, so build-std read the unpatched src.
- *In-place patch of the shared rustup toolchain*: **rejected.** It mutates a shared, rustup-managed
  directory (a surprise `rustup update` would clobber, and it clobbers what other projects build
  against), which the "never clobber" discipline warns against.
- *Hardlink-clone the toolchain* (`cp -al` bin+lib, real copy of just `src`, patch that): **chosen.**
  The clone's `librustc_driver` lives inside the clone, so rustc resolves the clone as its sysroot;
  blocks are shared so the disk cost is near zero; and the real toolchain is never touched.
  `cargo xtask std-src` builds and links it as `nife-dev`.

**Target specs, not real targets** (roadmap's "a spec first, a real target later if ever"): custom
JSON with `os = "nife"`, `panic-strategy = "abort"`, softfloat, and `singlethread = true`. That
last one is honest for phase one, one thread of execution per process, so std uses its `no_threads`
sync and single-`static` TLS; it flips off when `thread::spawn` becomes real. The ABI numbers and
the heap algorithm are generated verbatim into the patched std from `crates/abi` and `crates/user_heap`,
so they have exactly one definition and cannot drift.

**Accepted costs, recorded:** `SystemTime` is monotonic-since-boot rather than wall-clock (no RTC);
`std::random` is a non-cryptographic splitmix64 (no entropy source); stdout and stderr interleave on
one endpoint; and the `std-src` patches are string-anchored to the pinned nightly's std internals, a
coupling that fails loudly on a rustc bump (the intended tripwire) rather than silently. Proven by a
real std program (`Vec`, `String`, `HashMap`, `println!`, `Instant`) spawned as a workload and
checked byte for byte on both ISAs (the §19 parity gate).

**Amendment (phase two, 2026-07-28): `std::net` binds to the socket contract.** `std::net::TcpStream`
and outbound `std::net::UdpSocket` now work, backed by net_stack over the §25 socket contract; the
`net honestly unsupported` line of phase one is retired. The PAL (`sys/net/connection/nife.rs`) is
a **pure client** of the frozen contract, no new syscall and no new capability method: it holds a
`Stack` endpoint (slot 2) and a frame untyped (slot 3), mints a shared frame per socket, and drives
net_stack with `socket_proto` `CALL`s. The wire constants are generated verbatim from `crates/socket_proto/src/lib.rs`
into the patched std, the same anti-drift discipline as the ABI and heap crates. A std program does
networking only if it holds those two slots; without them `std::net` returns `Unsupported`, which is
"no ambient network" (§10) made visible from inside a process. The same `std_exerciser` binary proves
both: spawned without the net slots it runs the offline transcript, spawned with them (and a running
net_stack) it does a real UDP DNS query and a TCP echo round trip, each asserted byte for byte on both
ISAs. **`TcpListener` stopped being a gap on 2026-08-18** and the entry it used to hold is spent: the
PAL binding milestone 107 deferred is built, `bind` is `OP_LISTEN` and `accept` is `OP_ACCEPT` into a
second id, and a program without a listen grant gets `PermissionDenied` rather than `Unsupported`,
which is the difference between an authority it was refused and a platform that cannot. The honest
gap in its place is **an accepted connection's peer address**: `accept` must return a `SocketAddr`
and `OP_ACCEPT`'s reply carries no peer, so it answers `0.0.0.0:0`. Remaining gaps carried as
`Unsupported`: non-blocking mode and timeouts (blocking-only contract), DNS
resolution (`lookup_host`; numeric addresses only), and IPv6.
One finding reported up: net_stack ties a socket's local port to its socket id, so reopening a closed id
reuses its port and can stall against slirp; the fix is ephemeral local ports in net_stack, a contract-side
change (notes/std.md).

**Amendment (phase two, 2026-07-29): `std::fs` binds to the FS-service contract, and a path means
"under the directory I hold".** `std::fs::File` now works, backed by the §27 FS service; the
`fs honestly unsupported` line of phase one is retired for a program that was granted a directory.
The PAL (`sys/fs/nife.rs`) is again a pure client of a frozen contract, no new syscall and no new
capability method, with `crates/fs_proto` generated verbatim into the patched std.

**The design question, and the answer.** `File::open` takes a path and this system has no global
namespace, so the binding had to decide what a path *means*. Per §27, open-by-path exists only inside
the server, resolved against the one directory node the client's endpoint is bound to. So the mapping
is: **a std program holds a directory capability at slot 4, and `File::open("foo")` means "foo, under
the directory I was granted."** Everything else follows, and is enforced client-side before a byte
reaches the wire so a would-be escape becomes a legible error rather than an `ENOENT`:

- **An absolute path names the root of the caller's own namespace** (milestone 47, 2026-08-18), and
  any `..` that would climb above it is **refused as `ErrorKind::InvalidFilename`**, with a message
  naming which case it was. This bullet refused absolute paths outright until then, and that was the
  honest statement of what the binding did rather than a principle: `/` in a system where every
  program holds its own directory capability is Plan 9's answer, not a global root, so two programs
  in two subtrees resolve the same absolute token to two different files and neither can name the
  other's. The refusal was the missing machinery, not a property worth keeping. A **nested path is a chain of attenuated descents** (milestone 122), one
  `OPENDIR` per component, each hop asking for `DESCEND` plus what the final verb needs; the grant is
  exactly as tight as it was, because a child's rights are its parent's intersected with the request.
  This bullet refused nested paths outright until 2026-08-18, which was the honest statement of what
  the binding then did rather than a principle: a chain of descents never had the authority problem,
  only the machinery was missing. Deliberately **not** `PermissionDenied`: nothing consulted
  a permission, and there is no name here for what was asked, because no capability designates it.
  Mapping a capability refusal onto EPERM would smuggle in exactly the POSIX fiction this milestone
  exists to avoid. A name that is expressible but absent stays an ordinary `NotFound`, which is what
  makes the difference legible.
- A program with **no directory capability gets `Unsupported` from all of `std::fs`**, the same shape
  the net half uses without a `Stack` capability. Detecting that cannot touch the shared page (an
  ungranted program has none mapped), so the probe is a payload-free `FSTAT` on an impossible handle:
  the kernel refuses the invoke, or the server answers `-EBADF`, and only the latter means a
  filesystem is reachable.
- **The slot convention now has a gap, and the gap is load-bearing.** A program granted a directory
  but no network holds slots 0, 1, and 4, because empty 2 and 3 are how `std::net` knows it has no
  network. `Spawn.grants` fills from zero and cannot express that, so the kernel gained
  `sched::grant_at`, the same explicit-slot move `Tcb::CAP_INSERT` already offers a userspace loader
  (§26's fault slot uses it). notes/abi.md §4 records the convention.

Bound: open, read, write, seek, `metadata`/`len`, close on `Drop`, plus `metadata`/`read`/`exists` by
name. **Honestly `Unsupported`, because the contract has no verb for them** *(the create and truncate
half of this list is superseded by the phase-2 amendment two paragraphs down; the rest still holds)*:
creating a file and
truncating one (so `std::fs::write` and `File::create` are Unsupported by construction, and writing
means opening a file the image already carries), directory iteration, `mkdir`/`unlink`/`rename`,
symlinks and hard links, `canonicalize`, permissions, file times, locks, and `duplicate`. Proven on
both ISAs (§19) by the same `std_exerciser` binary, now with three behaviours chosen by its grants alone:
its stdout is compared byte for byte with the file's own bytes spliced in from the shared fixture, so
one assertion covers disk, block server, FS server, contract, PAL, and endpoint.

**Two things reported up rather than built** (see §27's amendment and notes/std.md): adding `CREATE`
and `TRUNCATE` verbs to the contract, which is what `std::fs::write` needs; and the overlap between
the wire's negated-errno space and the kernel's invoke-error space (-1..-8), where `-2` is both
`ENOENT` and `WrongObject`.

**Amendment (milestone 31 phase 2, 2026-07-30): `File::create` and `std::fs::write` work.** The first
of those two reported items is built (§27's amendment carries the contract side), so the PAL binds
`create`/`create_new` to `CREATE` and `truncate` to `TRUNCATE`, and the "creating a file and
truncating one are honestly Unsupported" line above is retired. The order in `File::open` is POSIX's
and it matters: open, then create only if the open reported `NotFound` and the caller asked for it,
then truncate after a successful open. `std::fs::write` is `create(true).truncate(true)`, so getting
that order wrong would leave the old tail behind on exactly the path that exists to *replace* a
file's contents, which is the day-costing confusion §27 records being corrected four times. A
`create_new` over a name that exists closes the handle the probing open minted and returns
`AlreadyExists`, rather than leaking it for the life of the process: the error path is the one nobody
exercises, so it is the one that leaks.

Creating a *file* was never what §27 kept host-side. That was creating a *filesystem*, which needs
uuid and getrandom; `Transaction::create_node` is not std-gated, so a file is made on-device without
entropy ever becoming a userspace dependency. The read of §27 that conflated the two is corrected
there.

Still Unsupported, each because no verb backs it: directory iteration, `mkdir`/`unlink`/`rename`,
symlinks and hard links, `canonicalize`, permissions, file times, locks, and `duplicate`. And a
program holding a **per-file** grant rather than a directory (§27's caretaker) sees the narrowing
through ordinary `std::fs` errors: the one granted name opens, any other is `NotFound`, and a write
through a read-only grant is `ReadOnlyFilesystem`. No std API had to change to express that, which is
the point of having bound the PAL to a capability contract rather than to a namespace.
