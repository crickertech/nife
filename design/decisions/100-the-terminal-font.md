# 100. The terminal font

(2026-08-20: the answer changed and most of the reasoning did not, which is
what this token is for.) **The font is now an original 7x8 drawing in the Kaypro II's style**, not
gohufont-14. calef ran a poll and the Kaypro's look won.

**What it replaces.** `font8x8`, which had shipped since milestone 29 and was chosen for its licence
rather than its looks.

## The amendment, 2026-08-20

**Three things happened between the first decision and this one, and only the poll is a matter of
taste.**

**1. The poll.** calef: *"I did a small poll and Kaypro II won, so lets switch to Kaypro II."* The
survey below had already rendered the Kaypro's ROM beside every candidate and judged it the loser on
letterforms; a poll of people looking at it disagreed, and on a question that is entirely about how
something looks, that is the better instrument. **The aesthetic verdict below is left standing rather
than rewritten**, because a reader deciding to change the font again should meet the argument against
the current one.

**2. The ROM still cannot ship, and did not.** `ivanizag/kaypro-disassembly` has **no `LICENSE` file
at all**, which is all-rights-reserved by default rather than permissive, and a bitmap font is
compiled into the kernel image and into every binary that draws text. That exclusion is unchanged
from the survey below, and it is the same rule that excluded Fixedsys Excelsior on a weaker
objection: **ambiguity is an obligation risk, and ambiguous means excluded.**

**So what shipped is an original drawing in that style.** Typeface-as-typeface is not copyrightable
subject matter (37 CFR 202.1(e), read at Cornell LII): the *look* is not protected, the specific
bitmap file is somebody's work. The drawing is `bench/font-options/kaypro-style-7x8.art` (provisional
name), and it is the authoring source with a test parsing it back against `glyphs.rs`, so the picture
a reviewer reads and the bits a terminal draws cannot drift.

**It measures like the ROM**, which is the check on whether the style survived the drawing: 13.7 ink
pixels per letter against 13.6, left-edge sigma 0.23 against 0.27. It is deliberately better in three
places the grid does not force: one shared baseline so `g p q y` descend rather than having their
bowls raised, `Il1|` as four distinct widths, and a slashed zero. It keeps what the grid does force,
including `M` and `W` as near-mirrors.

**3. And it dodged a fork, which is why it could ship at all.** gohufont-14 is 8x14, so on the
128x64 scanout it gives **16x4** characters, which is not a terminal. Growing the scanout ran into
the capability model rather than memory: `Object::Frame` names one page, a cspace has sixteen slots,
the display driver's DMA region holds nine, so the ceiling was **9 frames** against the 469 an
800x600 surface needs. That fork was answered separately and expensively (§102, a `Frame` names a
run). **The Kaypro's 7x8 cell needs none of it**: it gives **18x8** on the scanout we already have,
which is more screen than `font8x8`'s 16x8 rather than less.

**What is unchanged from the original decision**: every refusal below and its reason, the licence
analysis, and the finding that `font8x8` was the weakest thing in the survey and was what shipped.
**What is superseded**: the choice of gohufont-14, and the sentence below saying this decision does
not change what a user sees. It does now, and in the right direction.

## Why this one

**It was picked by looking, which is the only way to pick a font.** Milestone 29's crate is a pure
function from `(character, x, y)` to ink, so a specimen sheet is a thing the tree can print, and
`cargo run -p bitfont --example specimen` rendered every candidate on identical lines. The choice was
made from pictures rather than from a table of byte counts, and the same harness is what tested every
claim below.

**On the letterforms it beats what ships, and by a wide margin.** Nine rows of cap against
`font8x8`'s seven, seven of x-height against five, and a **three-row descender against one**, so
`g p q y j` get a tail rather than a hook. `font8x8` also carries display-ROM serifs on `I`, `l`, `t`
and `F` and a flared foot on `A`, which is noise at a size with no room for it, and its glyph widths
wander more than anything else measured (width sigma 0.79 against gohufont's 0.74, and its prose sets
clotted where gohufont's does not).

**And it carries no obligation at all.** WTFPL v2 is one operative term, read at `wtfpl.net`:

> 0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.

No notice to reproduce, no reserved font name, no share-alike, no cure period. That matters here
beyond convenience: **a bitmap font is compiled into the kernel image and into every binary that
draws text**, so its licence is a licence on the artefact rather than on a build-time tool.

## What was refused, and why each lost

- **`unscii-16`** (public domain) is the best-looking font in the survey and was calef's first pick.
  It is 8x16, so it gives **16x4** on the current scanout, exactly what gohufont-14 costs, and
  gohufont was preferred once both were seen at the same size.
- **`unscii-8`** (public domain) is the best 8x8 and keeps all eight rows. Refused on looks alone,
  which is the whole basis of this decision.
- **Terminus** (OFL-1.1) reserves the name **"Terminus Font"**, and the OFL forbids a Modified
  Version using a reserved name. Being picky about fonts means eventually fixing a glyph, so that
  clause is a live cost for us rather than a formality, and the OFL has no cure period: it
  *"becomes null and void"* if a condition is missed.
- **Spleen 5x8** (BSD-2-Clause, no reserved name) is the one candidate that gives **more** screen
  than today, 25x8 against 16x8. It remains the strongest argument against this decision and the
  block below says so rather than burying it.
- **The Kaypro II character ROM** was found, verified bit-identical to MAME's `kayproii` chargen
  region, rendered, and **excluded on provenance**: the dump states no licence at all. It also lost
  on looks. See notes/glyphs.md.
- **A hand-drawn font** was drawn, 95 glyphs, and judged *"not worse than what ships, and not as
  good as Terminus or unscii-8."* Kept in the tree as a specimen, not as a candidate.
- **Linux's `lib/fonts/font_8x16.c`** is `GPL-2.0` on line one. **VileR's Oldschool PC Font Pack** is
  CC BY-SA, which is share-alike. **Fixedsys Excelsior**'s public-domain claim could not be read at
  its source. All excluded, ambiguity included, which is this tree's standing rule.

## What this costs, stated plainly

***Overtaken by the amendment.** The grid is 18x8, not 16x4, because the font that shipped is 7x8
rather than 8x14. The paragraph below is kept because its reasoning about the scanout is still true
and is what sent the tree into §102; the arithmetic in it applies to gohufont-14, which did not
ship.*

**gohufont-14 is 8x14, and the scanout is 128x64, so the text grid becomes 16x4.** Four rows. That is
not a terminal, and notes/glyphs.md says so in its own words.

**So this decision is about which font, and it does not by itself change what a user sees.** Shipping
it at four rows would make the terminal worse in exchange for better letters. The scanout is what has
to move, and that is a display-ladder question rather than a font one: 128x64 was chosen so that a
stride bug, a transposition and an x/y swap are all size or content mismatches rather than invisible
(`gfx_proto::WIDTH`), and the only hard floor named is QEMU's 16 pixels per side. Nothing forces it
to stay small; the cost of growing it is in the pixel-for-pixel test harness rather than the driver.

## The obligations, and where they land

***Overtaken by the amendment, and in the same direction.** What shipped is an original drawing, so
there is no third party and no licence at all. The `vendor/README.md` entry is not owed, because the
tree carries no bits it did not write for this. The paragraph below describes gohufont-14's WTFPL
position, which stands if the font is ever revisited.*

There are none to satisfy. Recorded anyway, because a reader will reasonably ask:

- **Nothing need travel with the image.** No notice, no licence text, no attribution.
- **`vendor/README.md`** gets an entry regardless, because the tree registers the provenance of
  everything it did not write, and the register is worth more than the obligation would have been.
- **`deny.toml`** is unaffected: `script/supply-chain` reads the cargo graph, and a font transcribed
  into a Rust table is not in it. That gap is real and belongs on the register rather than the gate.

**One thing worth deciding with open eyes**: the licence's name is unusual, and if licence text is
ever put in milestone 40's documentation store, `doc licenses/gohufont` would print it at the nife
prompt. That is a taste question rather than a legal one, and it is calef's.

## BUGS

- **The choice was settled by a poll, and the survey disagreed with it.** The rendered comparison
  judged the Kaypro's letterforms the loser and said so in measured terms. A poll of people looking
  at the thing overruled that, on a question that is entirely about how something looks. Both are in
  the record on purpose; a reader should be able to see that the tree's own instrument lost.
- **The shipped font is an original drawing and inherits none of the survey's measurements.** Its own
  numbers are in notes/glyphs.md, and two glyphs are recorded there as weak: `&` reads as a knot and
  `%` looks bolder than its neighbours.
- **The comparison is against fifteen candidates, not against every bitmap font.** The survey
  excluded proprietary faces without rendering them, and the best-drawn fonts of the 1980s are
  proprietary: the original Macintosh bitmaps, Monaco among them, were drawn by a designer Apple
  paid, which is exactly why they are not available.
- **`gohufont-14`'s WTFPL text carries no warranty disclaimer**, where BSD-2 and OFL both do. No
  candidate's disclaimer was ever going to matter for a font, and the difference is real and is
  recorded rather than smoothed over.
- **The measurements in notes/glyphs.md are this tree's own**, taken by its own harness rather than
  by a typographic tool. They are good enough to rank candidates and should not be quoted as
  properties of the fonts themselves.
