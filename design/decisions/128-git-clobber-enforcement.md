# 128. What enforces the git-clobber rule, now that it has crossed its own threshold

**Status: DECIDED.** calef, 2026-08-25, in conversation, on the evidence below: "No repeat in three
weeks seems like it isn't a problem any longer." Milestone 118's own violation ledger
(`notes/rule-violations.md`) said the git-clobber rule sat at four open strikes, one past its own
three-strike threshold, with no enforcement mechanism decided, and named this "calef's or the
integrator's call, not this lane's." This entry lays out the real options researched for that
call, and the decision: accept, no new mechanism, the ledger row marked `resolved`.

## The real incidents, precisely

All three recorded rows trace to **one day, 2026-08-04**, not a spread pattern, and none since
(`notes/rule-violations.md`, last run 2026-08-22):

1. **The squash-against-`origin/main` scar.** A lane ran `git reset --soft origin/main` (instead of
   its own recorded base SHA) to squash checkpoints, and silently staged four other lanes' files as
   its own, including a deletion. Caught only by reading `git status` before committing
   (`AGENTS.md`, "Commits"). One instance.
2. **The aggregated "four agents" row.** `AGENTS.md`'s own "What it costs, measured 2026-08-05"
   section reports "four agents clobbered work with `reset --hard`, `checkout` or `stash`" on
   2026-08-04, as one summary count rather than four individually detailed incidents; this is the
   ledger row currently sitting past threshold.
3. **The `pkill -f` incident.** A lane killed another lane's QEMU mid-test. One instance, same day.

All agent-caused; none human-typed. **Zero repeats in the three weeks since**, which matters for
weighing whether this is an ongoing pattern or a one-day cluster that predates a convention
(`AGENTS.md`'s own git-safety section) written in direct response to it.

## What already exists to build on

`script/setup` already runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`, a shared, versioned hooks
directory covering every worktree from the one `.git` this project's multi-lane structure shares.
One hook exists there today: `.githooks/pre-push`, running `script/fmt --check` before every push
(bypassable with `--no-verify`, the same escape hatch this project already accepts elsewhere).

No `.claude/settings.json` exists in this repo. Claude Code's own Bash tool permission system,
which every incident above went through (100% agent-caused, via the Bash tool), is currently
unconfigured for this class of command.

## The options, sized rather than asserted

- **A git hook.** Checked against git 2.55.0's actual hook list: there is no `pre-checkout`,
  `pre-reset`, or `pre-stash` hook, only `post-checkout`, which fires after the damage is done. A
  literal "pre-command check via a git hook" is infeasible for the commands this rule is actually
  about. This collapses "hook" into the same mechanism as the next option.
- **A `git` shim on `PATH`.** Technically works, but `checkout` has a real ambiguity a shim cannot
  resolve by prefix alone: `git checkout <path>` (destroys uncommitted changes) and
  `git checkout <branch>` / `git checkout -b <branch>` (ordinary, constant, safe) share the same
  prefix. `reset --hard`, `clean -f`, and `branch -D` do not have this problem; each is an
  unambiguous, always-dangerous form.
- **An alias** (`git undo`, `git safe-reset`). Cheapest option, but purely opt-in: offers a safer
  spelling without ever stopping the dangerous one from still being typed, agent or human.
- **Claude Code's own Bash permission system** (`.claude/settings.json` deny rules). Not one of
  the ledger's original four options, but the one that matches where every incident actually
  occurred: the Bash tool call, not a raw shell. `reset --hard`, `clean -f`, and `branch -D` are
  cleanly denyable today with a settings entry and zero new tooling, since the mechanism already
  exists in the tool this project's agents already run through. `checkout <path>` carries the same
  ambiguous-prefix problem a shim has, so a deny rule narrow enough not to block ordinary branch
  switching cannot fully close that one case either.
- **Accept and mark `resolved` as unenforceable.** Given zero repeats in three weeks, a real
  question worth weighing rather than dismissing: does the incident rate reflect an ongoing risk,
  or a one-day cluster that predates the AGENTS.md convention written in direct response to it,
  already largely doing the job?

## The decision

**Accept, mark the ledger row `resolved`, add no new mechanism.** The recommendation researched
here (deny `reset --hard`, `clean -f`, and `branch -D` in `.claude/settings.json`, the cheapest
option that actually prevents rather than merely discourages, targeting the layer every real
incident went through) was priced and available, but calef's read of the evidence decided it
differently: all four incidents trace to a single day, 2026-08-04, and the three weeks since have
carried zero repeats. That reads as `AGENTS.md`'s own prose (the "move fast on what can be undone"
section, the squash-against-base-SHA scar, the worktree-pruning warnings, all written in direct
response to that day) already doing the job, not as a dormant risk waiting to recur. Building a new
technical control on top of a rule that has not been broken since would be solving an
already-solved problem.

`notes/rule-violations.md`'s git-clobber row is marked `resolved` on this basis: the *concern* is
resolved, not the underlying `AGENTS.md` rule, which is untouched and stays the active guard.

**`checkout <path>`'s ambiguity (it cannot be distinguished from ordinary branch switching by
prefix alone, in a shim or in a Claude Code deny rule) is recorded rather than solved**, since no
mechanism was going to be built either way. `AGENTS.md`'s existing prose guidance (check
`git status` before a destructive-shaped command; prefer stash over discard) remains the answer.

## If the pattern recurs

The ledger's own exact-text matching means a differently-worded recurrence starts its own count
rather than reopening this row, so a future reader hitting a new git-clobber incident should not
assume this decision covers it silently. Re-raise the question with the new evidence; the options
priced above (a `.claude/settings.json` deny rule being the strongest available one, `checkout
<path>`'s ambiguity being the one gap nothing surveyed here closes) do not need re-researching from
scratch.
