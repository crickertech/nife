# 149. May the kernel answer on an endpoint, where §121 leaves no userspace holder?

2026-09-15, and the answer is no. Raised 2026-09-09 by the maintainer. Resolved
not by picking one of its three options but by **dissolving its premise**: this section asked what to
do *given that §121 leaves no userspace holder on x86*, and on 2026-09-15 calef reopened §121 to give
x86 exactly that holder (the port-range capability). So the kernel does **not** answer on an endpoint;
x86's console is a userspace driver like the other two. See the resolution at the end. *(Number
provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

**What is blocked: x86_64 reaching an interactive shell at all**, and therefore milestone 182, and
therefore the whole "every architecture boots to swish" half of the parity target.

## The question, in one sentence

On aarch64 and riscv64, `swish` does not talk to a UART. It talks to a **console server over an
endpoint**, and that server is `components/src/console.rs`, an unprivileged process holding the UART's
page as a capability. **On x86_64 there is no such server and there cannot be one**, so the question
is whether a **kernel thread** may park on the same rendezvous and answer the same protocol.

## Why there cannot be one, which is settled rather than open

DECISIONS §121 ratified option 2 permanently: **x86's legacy port-I/O devices stay in the kernel**,
and only MMIO devices get the mapping-based capability. COM1 on xenon is the built-in port at
`3F8h`, IRQ 4 (`notes/xenon-firmware.md`, read off the firmware screen), so it is port I/O, so it is
kernel-resident, and that is a decision rather than a gap.

**This section does not reopen §121 and must not be read as doing so.** §121 decided *where the
driver lives*. This decides *how a program reaches it*, which §121 raised and did not answer: its
own text says what is blocked is "a **userspace console or input driver on x86**", and leaves the
consequence for the shell unstated.

## What the tree already provides, measured rather than assumed

- The endpoint object is `Object::Rendezvous`, and the kernel's is `type Rendezvous =
  inter_process_communication::Rendezvous<Thread>` (`kernel/src/sched.rs:73`).
- `crates/inter_process_communication`'s rendezvous is **generic over `T: Node`** and
  host-testable, with no privilege level anywhere in it. `ThreadControlBlock` is what implements
  `Node`.
- **The kernel already has kernel threads**, which run a closure on their own stack
  (`kernel/src/thread.rs`, "starts a kernel thread's closure").
- `crates/inter_process_communication`'s own doc names the parked-server case as the ordinary one:
  a thread queued on a rendezvous is permanently `Blocked`, "and the commonest such thread is a
  server".

So the mechanism needs **no new object type, no new syscall number, and no change to the surface**
(§10, §16). That is the strongest argument here and it is worth stating plainly: this is the option
that does not grow the boundary.

## The options

**Option 1: a kernel thread parks on a rendezvous and answers the console protocol.** `swish` is
byte-identical on all three architectures and never learns where its console server lives. The
divergence §121 requires stays entirely below the interface.

- *For*: no surface growth; parity at the level that a program can observe; the client code, the
  protocol and the tests are one thing rather than three.
- *Against*: a kernel thread that clients can block is a denial-of-service and priority-inversion
  surface that **none of §40's subtree-death supervision reaches**, because the thing that wedges is
  the kernel. It puts a message parser inside the trusted computing base, which is code that has to
  be verified rather than argued about. And it is a real, if narrow, concession against §14's
  minimal-core claim: seL4's position is that the kernel provides mechanism and no services.

**Option 2: a console syscall.** The kernel exposes a write/read pair and `swish` calls it directly
on x86.

- *For*: smaller to build; no kernel thread to schedule or wedge.
- *Against*: it is syscall surface, the expensive kind under the *move fast on what can be undone*
  tenet, and every future program is written against it. **It is also worse on security grounds in a
  capability system**, and this is the part that is easy to get backwards: a syscall is reachable by
  every thread in the system, where an endpoint is reachable only by whoever was handed the
  capability, and can be revoked. Option 2 asks for a rule about who should call it; option 1 makes
  most programs unable to.
- It also puts a permanently x86-shaped hole in the client: `swish` would have to know which
  architecture it is on, which is the divergence this is trying to remove.

**Option 3: reach the shell through the graphical stack instead**, which is what milestone 182
currently assumes. The framebuffer is MMIO, so the existing mapping model works untouched.

- *For*: no new mechanism of any kind.
- *Against*: it makes milestone 177, the largest piece in the tree, a prerequisite for x86 having a
  shell, which inverts the agreed order (software parity first). It also leaves x86 with **no serial
  path for a bench session**, and `board_console` reads a wire.

## Recommendation

**Option 1**, and the effort test (§92, and the seventh question) comes out the same way: if all
three cost the same, option 1 is still the one to pick, because it is the only one where the
interface does not diverge. It is not the cheapest to build; option 2 is.

The denial-of-service objection is real and is the part that wants designing rather than assuming.
The shape that answers it is a service thread that **never blocks on a client**: it may block
waiting for a message, which is the ordinary parked-server case, but must not park inside handling
one.

## What this deliberately does not decide

**Whether the kernel should serve IPC generally, to expose facts only it knows** (preemption counts,
scheduler state, the machine description). calef raised that in the same conversation and it is a
better question than this one, but it is a **different** question, and the two were deliberately
separated so that the general case is not decided on the momentum of the narrow one:

| | This section (console) | Kernel introspection |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel holds a device | yes | no |
| On the data path | every byte | one question, then done |
| Blocks a kernel thread indefinitely | yes | no |
| `swish` works without it | no | yes |
| Architectures | x86 only, a divergence | all three, parity |
| Why we would do it | **forced** by the hardware | **chosen**, because it beats a syscall |

That last row is why they are separate. One is a concession with no alternative; the other is a
design we would pick freely. **A reader citing this section for the general case is misreading it**,
and the introspection question should get its own section when there is an actual fact to expose
rather than in the abstract.

## BUGS

- **The kernel-thread-parks-on-a-rendezvous mechanism is verified at the data-structure level
  only.** `crates/inter_process_communication` is generic and privilege-free, and kernel threads
  exist, but nothing here has proved the kernel's own receive path is free of an assumption that the
  receiver entered from EL0. A lane will find that, and if the assumption exists this becomes a
  larger fork than it reads as.
- **Nothing in this section prices the denial-of-service work**, which is named as a shape and not as
  a design.
- **This is the first kernel-resident IPC server in the tree**, so there is no in-tree precedent to
  follow and no second instance to check a convention against.


## Resolved 2026-09-15: the premise was removed, not one of the options chosen

This section's question was conditional: *given* that §121 keeps x86's serial driver in the kernel, is
a kernel thread serving the console the least-bad way to reach a prompt? It listed a fourth path only
implicitly, by citing §121: change §121 so there **is** a userspace holder. That is what calef did.

**§121 was reopened and reversed to its own option 1** (the port-range capability); x86's console and
input become userspace drivers holding a `(base, count)` port capability. So every option this section
weighed is moot: there is no kernel-resident console driver to serve behind an endpoint, no console
syscall, and no need to reach the shell through graphics. `swish` talks to a userspace console server
on x86 exactly as it does on aarch64 and riscv64, and this section's recommended option 1 (the kernel
thread) is **not** built.

**Why the recommendation here lost, recorded because it was argued for.** This section recommended the
kernel thread on the strength of the interface-does-not-diverge test, and it was right that the client
stays identical. What it undervalued is that the kernel thread keeps a device driver in the kernel,
which is the one thing §14's thesis says userspace should hold, and that the endpoint's ability to hide
the driver's location is a reason to *migrate* later, not a reason to build the kernel version first.
calef ruled straight to the userspace driver (DECISIONS §121, milestone 299), accepting a slower path
to the x86 prompt in exchange for not shipping a kernel-resident driver at all. The BUGS below, about a
kernel-resident IPC server's denial-of-service surface and its place in the trusted computing base, are
retired by that choice rather than answered: there is no kernel-resident server.
