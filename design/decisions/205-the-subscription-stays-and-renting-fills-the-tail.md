# 205. The subscription stays, and rented models fill the mechanical tail

**Status: DECIDED.** calef, 2026-09-22. *(Number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*
He had proposed downgrading Max 20x to Max 5x, freeing $100 a month for open-weight models, and
cancelled that after the numbers came in. **Max 20x renews.**

## What was actually proposed, and why it failed

The plan was symmetric and wrong in one term: drop **75%** of Claude capacity, replace it with
rented open-weight capacity at a fraction of the price. §202 (mechanical work goes to a cheaper
model) had ruled the routing and §203 (capacity is rented rather than bought) had ruled the
sourcing, so this looked like execution rather than a new decision.

**calef found the flaw before the maintainer did**, in one sentence: *"30% offload doesn't seem like
enough if we're bumping up against 20X and downgrading to 5X. It seems like we need to offload
75%."*

## The measurements that settled it, all taken 2026-09-22

The infrastructure works and is not the constraint. An Anthropic-format gateway runs on cordoba
(notes/open-model-lanes.md), and **three real lanes completed on open-weight models with every gate
green**. What decided the question was price per *kind* of work:

| lane | model | cost |
|---|---|---|
| renumber two milestone files, pure mechanics | Qwen3-Coder | **$0.048** |
| the same, for comparison | Kimi K3, uncached | $0.393 |
| the same, preference-pinned so the cache warms | Kimi K3 | $0.258 |
| **milestone 570 (the install offer should say what is already on the disk), a real implementation** | Qwen3-Coder | **$0.98** |

**The twentyfold gap between the first and last rows is the finding.** A mechanical lane is five
cents; a real implementation lane is about a dollar. Twenty implementation lanes a day is **$600 a
month**, three times the subscription it would replace, and Max 20x supports roughly 100 to 140
lanes a month, which is **$1.50 to $2 a lane**. So renting is *modestly* cheaper than the
subscription for implementation and **dramatically** cheaper only for the mechanical tail.

Against that, the offloadable share measured about **30%** of lanes, and those are also the *cheap*
lanes in tokens: the promotion repair took 125k and the falsification refresh 169k, against 549k for
the installer and 344k for rung 2b. So the tail is roughly **18% of a day's tokens**.

**18% offloaded cannot fund a 75% cut.** That is the whole arithmetic.

## What is decided

1. **Max 20x renews.** The binding constraint is a rate limit rather than a bill (§203), and
   downgrading tightens exactly the thing that hurts.
2. **The mechanical tail moves off Claude anyway**, because it is nearly free: ~180 lanes a month at
   $0.048 is about **$9**, a 4.5% spend increase that returns roughly **18% of Claude capacity**,
   or three to four more judgement lanes a day.
3. **Maintainer work is the next candidate and is unmeasured.** Queue nannying, CI-log triage and
   rebase conflict resolution are mechanical, are done in the most expensive context available, and
   plausibly exceed the 18% above. The first delegated rebase ran on 2026-09-22.

## BUGS

- **The redo rate is unmeasured, and it is the number most likely to invert this.** A lane that
  passes every gate and must be redone on Claude costs *more* than never having offloaded. Three
  open-model lanes have passed their gates; **two carried editorial defects a gate cannot see** (one
  dropped a load-bearing sentence, one conflated "unpartitioned" with "unreadable" in a prompt whose
  purpose is informed consent). Neither required a redo, but neither was clean.
- **The maintainer's own consumption is still not instrumented.** Every share above is a count of
  lanes or of subagent-reported tokens; the session's own use is invisible, which is what milestone
  553 (what a lane spent on its milestone) exists to fix and has not.
- **All prices are one day's observation** on one provider, with one model per row and no repeats.
  A second run of the same lane could move any of them.
