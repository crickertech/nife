# 170. Narrowing the root of the shell's namespace: a verb on the wire, or a shallower root

**Status: PROPOSED.** Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice B, which read milestone 328's
`DECISION` gate and found it naming no section. The fork is milestone 31's, stated in that block
under *"The two shapes a grant cannot take"* and carried forward by the 2026-09-03 proposal sweep.
*(Section number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

## What is being decided

Milestone 31's claim is that **typing a name is the grant**. At the top prompt it is false: `rm
rmtree/rm-solo` works and `rm gate.txt` is refused, and the only difference is one level of path.

A subtree caretaker attenuates by performing one `OPENDIR` *into* the directory it was granted. The
root of the shell's namespace has no name to descend into, so there is nothing to attenuate through.
Two answers, and they are permanent in different ways:

1. **A narrowing verb on `filesystem_protocol`**, meaning "the directory I already hold, with fewer
   rights", with no name resolution.
2. **An interactive boot whose shell starts one component below the image root**, so the root the
   user meets always has a parent.

## The tree as it stands, read rather than recalled

`crates/filesystem_protocol` carries verbs 0 through 22 (`OPEN` through `SETMTIME_AT`) and none of
them means what option 1 needs. `dir::Rights::attenuate` exists and is **client-side only**:

```rust
pub const fn attenuate(self, requested: u64) -> Self {
    Rights(self.0 & requested)
}
```

One `&`, a total function with no failure mode, and machine-checked: `attenuate_never_widens` is a
Kani proof over an arbitrary parent and an arbitrary request, with a replayable falsification beside
it. `OPENDIR` and `MKDIR` narrow *through* that function; nothing applies it to a handle already
held.

So option 1's arithmetic is built and proved. What is not built is a verb that reaches it, and the
server side that mints a second handle from a first.

## The neighbouring decision, which should be read with this one

[§98](98-opendir-cannot-attenuate.md) is `PROPOSED` and is a rights change to the same wire, raised
by milestone 122's lane: `OPENDIR` cannot be asked for "the parent's rights, whatever they are", so
a `Dir` asks for `dir::ALL` and then discovers what it holds by probing one right at a time. Its
proposal is a sentinel in `OPENDIR`'s rights word, about thirty lines across the protocol, the
server and the PAL.

**The two do not subsume each other and the difference is worth stating**, because a reader meeting
both will assume one design covers them. §98 is about a client that cannot read its own capability
and therefore cannot ask for the right amount; this is about a handle with no parent to ask through.
A sentinel in `OPENDIR` still needs a name to open. A narrowing verb still leaves a client unable to
discover what it holds.

**What they do share is a page in calef's queue.** Both add rights machinery to `filesystem_protocol`
and both are irreversible in the same way. Answering them in one sitting costs less than answering
them six weeks apart, and answering §98 alone would be the more expensive order, because it ships a
rights-shaped addition to this wire without the other case in view.

## The options

| | shape | cost |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | A narrowing verb, verb 23. Takes a held directory handle and a rights mask, mints a second handle, resolves no name. | Small in the server, and the arithmetic is `attenuate` with its proof already written. It is an addition to something two programs agree on, so it cannot be un-shipped. Verb 23 is a number every future reader of this protocol carries. |
| **B** | An interactive boot whose shell is rooted one component below the image root. | Nothing on the wire, nothing to un-ship, and no new verb. It changes what every relative path at that prompt means, which cannot be un-taught: every example, every note and every person's habit moves one level. |
| **C** | Neither, and the limitation is recorded where the reader meets the feature. | Free, and it is the option milestone 31's block did not take, because `notes/dir-capability.md` already carries the sibling case (a grant more than one level down) as a `BUGS` entry and this one is a fork rather than a limitation. |

**No recommendation, deliberately.** Both A and B are in the column AGENTS.md prices as
irreversible: A is a thing two programs agree on, and B is a fact that lands in a reader's head. The
tenet's own limit says a fork of this kind arrives as options.

**What a lane could measure before the ruling, and it is not much.** A's size is already known from
§98's neighbouring estimate (about thirty lines for a smaller change on the same surfaces). B's cost
is not a measurement at all; it is a judgement about what a prompt means, which is why it is calef's.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Milestone 328**, entirely. Nothing else cites it, and `script/shell-check` gates the working case
on both ISAs, so there is no regression risk in leaving it: what stands is a permanent hole in the
headline demonstration, at the one place a newcomer starts.
