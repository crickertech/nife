# 77. The branch-prefix list now describes the tree

calef, 2026-08-16, taking the recommendation as written: **`roadmap/`,
`decisions/`, `toolchain/` and `ci/` are legitimate**, `dependabot/` is exempt as
machine-generated, `docs/` and `design/` stay out with their single uses standing as history, and
**`audit/` and `finalize/` are kept** as declared intent despite never having been used, because
they cost a word each and removing a permitted name is how a lane that read an older file gets
its branch refused.

Applied the same day. The gate's own blind spot, recorded below and worth keeping in view, bit
twice more before this landed: on 2026-08-15 it rejected `notes/` (a fifth unlisted prefix, whose
branch was renamed rather than argued with) and, more expensively, it rejected GitHub's own
`gh-readonly-queue/*` and so failed **every merge-queue group build** for most of an evening,
which read as a hung queue. That exemption landed in its own change (#217); this one is the
vocabulary half.

**What.** `script/lint` check 4 accepts `milestone/`, `fix/`, `bench/`, `audit/`, `integration/`,
`finalize/` and `feature/`, and rejects everything else. It runs on the current branch only, and
skips a detached HEAD deliberately, because every CI `pull_request` run builds a merge commit and has
no branch to judge. That design is right and is documented in the script.

**The defect is the list.** Counting merge commits on `main` by the prefix they came from:

| prefix | merges | in the list |
|---|---|---|
| `milestone/` | 28 | yes |
| **`roadmap/`** | **25** | **no** |
| `integration/` | 23 | yes |
| `fix/` | 19 | yes |
| `toolchain/` | 3 | no |
| `feature/` | 3 | yes |
| `decisions/` | 2 | no |
| `ci/` | 2 | no |
| `bench/` | 1 | yes |
| `docs/`, `design/`, `dependabot/` | 1 each | no |

`roadmap/` is the **second most used prefix in the repository** and the lint rejects it. The check
would have refused about 35 of the merges that are already on `main`, and `audit/` and `finalize/`
are permitted while having never been used.

**Why nobody noticed.** The check cannot fail CI by design, so it only ever fires for whoever runs
`script/lint` locally, on whichever branch they happen to be on. A lane on `milestone/` never sees it.
This is a gate whose blind spot is the population it is aimed at.

**The question, which is a vocabulary one and therefore calef's.** Which of `roadmap/`,
`decisions/`, `toolchain/` and `ci/` become legitimate, and which of the tree's uses were mistakes
that should have been something else? The one-offs (`docs/`, `design/`, `dependabot/`) are a separate
call: `dependabot/` is not ours to choose, and `docs/` and `design/` each have a single use and may
simply be `roadmap/` or `notes/` under another name.

**The recommendation.** Add `roadmap/`, `decisions/`, `toolchain/` and `ci/`, since each is
established, each matches a real thing in the tree, and the alternative is a gate that is wrong more
often than the developer is. Exempt `dependabot/` as machine-generated. Leave `docs/` and `design/`
out and let their single uses stand as history. Consider dropping `audit/` and `finalize/`, which
have never been used, or keep them as declared intent and say which.

**No vocabulary change is made here**, because a name is calef's call even when the name is a branch
prefix. The measurement is recorded so the decision can be argued against numbers.

**Practical impact until answered:** `script/lint` exits 1 at its last check on a `roadmap/` or
`decisions/` branch, after all its real work has passed. CI is unaffected, so nothing is actually
blocked.
