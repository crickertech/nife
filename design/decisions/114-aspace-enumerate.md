# 114. `pmap` gets its listing: `ENUMERATE` extends to the address-space object

**Status: DECIDED.** calef, 2026-08-23, approving milestone 126's `pmap` fork on the recommendation
below: *"Yes, pmap first."*

## The question

Milestone 126's gate named one open decision blocking `pmap`: whether `Rights::ENUMERATE` extends
to the address-space object (`Aspace`, renamed `AddressSpace` by DECISIONS §113), the same way it
already extends to `Endpoint`/`Rendezvous` for `ps`/`pgrep`'s survey.

## The decision

**Yes.** A new method on the address-space object, gated by `Rights::ENUMERATE`, lists what is
mapped without granting the ability to map or unmap. `pmap` is built against it.

## Why this was not really a live fork

The call site has been waiting for exactly this since the object was created:
`kernel/src/syscall.rs`'s `RETYPE_OBJ` handler for `ASPACE` carries a comment written when the
object was first built, "`Aspace` does not consult `ENUMERATE` today and is expected to when
`pmap` is built." Every address-space object already receives `Rights::ALL` at creation (the same
invariant `Endpoint`/`Rendezvous` uses), so the bit has been present and unused the whole time;
nothing is retrofitted.

The analogous case is already built and proven: `Endpoint::SURVEY` (milestone 126's first stratum,
2026-08-16) gates on `Rights::ENUMERATE`, adds no new syscall number, and three Kani harnesses hold
the property that the domain a monitor sees and the domain a supervisor may collect from cannot
diverge. This is the same shape one object type over: read a mapping without being able to change
it.

Cost and reversibility, per the six-questions framework: no new right, no new syscall number, no
wire commitment two programs already depend on. A new method on an existing object type is exactly
what CLAUDE.md's syscall-surface rule calls fine to add within the established capability model.
Fully reversible if it turns out wrong.

**One real cost the first pass at this decision missed, caught rereading `notes/process-view.md`
before writing this up rather than after:** every address-space capability minted since 2026-08-17
already carries `ENUMERATE`, because of the `Rights::ALL`-on-creation invariant `Endpoint` also
uses. The day the new method starts consulting the bit, every existing holder of a delegated
(not self-created) address-space capability that happened to keep `ENUMERATE` -- because nobody
had a reason to strip a bit that did nothing yet -- gains a real new power nobody assessed at
delegation time. This is not hypothetical: the milestone's own first stratum already found and
fixed the identical shape once (a `ps` riding on `READ` could reap, because `READ` covered a right
nobody had separated out yet). **Whoever builds `pmap` audits existing address-space delegation
sites before the method ships**, narrowing any that should not carry `ENUMERATE` the same way the
`READ`/`ENUMERATE` split was applied retroactively for `Endpoint`. This does not change the
decision; it changes what "built" requires to be true before the method goes live.

## What this does not decide

The exact method name and wire shape (mirroring `SURVEY`'s shape is the expectation, not a
requirement) is left to whoever builds `pmap`, who records the new method's semantics in
`DECISIONS.md` per the standing rule for new methods within the established model.

## What it unblocks

Milestone 126's `pmap`, the second of its four still-blocked view programs (`pmap`, `top`, `pwdx`,
`w`). `top` (per-thread CPU accounting), `pwdx` and `w` (a process display name) remain blocked on
work this decision does not touch.
