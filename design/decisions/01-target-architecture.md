# 1. Target architecture: aarch64

Chosen over x86_64 and RISC-V.

x86_64 has the deepest pool of tutorials, but a large fraction of what it teaches is
Intel history (real mode, the A20 line, segmentation ghosts, PIC-vs-APIC) rather than
operating system concepts. RISC-V is the cleanest architecture to learn on, but it is
the *hardest* of the three to actually get onto silicon: peripheral documentation for
the JH7110-class SoCs is thin.

aarch64 gives a clean exception model (EL0/EL1/EL2/EL3), a sane MMU, an excellent
bare-metal community, and real hardware at the end of the road (Raspberry Pi). The dev
machine is also ARM, so kernel assembly and host assembly are the same instruction set.
