# 126. A process holding two directory capabilities gets a real, single, moving `cwd`

**Status: DECIDED.** calef, 2026-08-25, in conversation, closing one of [milestone
154](../roadmap/154-multi-directory-namespace.md)'s own three "still open" items. Raised as a
direct question: "Let's do a real cwd. Isn't that a better user experience?" Answered yes, with
the boundary behavior settled below.

## The question

[Milestone 154](../roadmap/154-multi-directory-namespace.md) built `grant_plan::nav::TwoRoots`: a
process holding two labeled directory capabilities can resolve `/a/...` against the first and
`/b/...` against the second, and `/a/../b` is refused because there is nothing above `a`'s own
root to pop. That mechanism is deliberately stateless: every lookup is absolute and labeled, and a
bare relative name (no leading `/`) is refused outright, because "a two-grant holder has two roots
and no reason to prefer either" (`TwoRoots::resolve`'s own doc comment) is exactly the shadowing
question [milestone 47](../roadmap/47-navigation-and-naming.md)'s four open questions leave
undecided.

The milestone's own text left "wiring a second grant into the real interactive boot" as calef's
call, "a boot-time decision... policy rather than mechanism." Underneath that sits a sharper,
narrower question that does not require deciding 47's harder open questions (unions, shadowing
across many sources, enumeration, whether `$PATH` survives as a string) at all: **does a two-grant
shell have a real, single, moving current directory, the way a one-grant shell already does?**

## The decision: yes, a real cwd, refuse at either tree's own root

**State**: a pair `(which: A | B, pos: Cwd)` in place of the single `Cwd` a one-grant `Holdings`
carries today. `pos` is the existing single-tree position type, unchanged.

**Resolution**:
- A bare relative name resolves against `pos` inside whichever tree `which` currently names.
  Identical to today's one-grant behavior, parameterized by which tree the process is standing in.
- An absolute path (`/a/...` or `/b/...`) resolves the same way `TwoRoots` already does today:
  picks the tree by label, resolves the rest from that tree's own root. This is also how a process
  moves between trees: `cd /b/somewhere` while standing in `a` works with no new verb.

**The boundary: `..` at either tree's own root refuses**, the same `Refused::AtYourRoot` a
one-grant `Cwd::apply` already gives at its own root, applied per-tree rather than newly invented.
Two alternatives were priced before deciding this one:

- **Silently clamp instead of refusing** (stay put, no error), matching real Unix shells: `/..`
  resolves to `/` itself on every mainstream system, because the on-disk directory-entry format
  requires the root's `..` entry to point somewhere and self-reference is the only sane value.
  That representational necessity does not exist in nife: `Cwd` is a synthetic position tracker in
  a capability-routed namespace, not a walk over on-disk `..` pointers, so refusing costs exactly
  the same one-branch check that clamping would; nothing about nife's implementation makes silence
  the cheaper or more natural choice the way it was for early Unix. And the event means something
  more security-salient here: hitting your root in Unix means "the top of the whole visible
  filesystem," where nothing is hidden by stopping silently; hitting your root in nife means "the
  edge of a specific, narrow capability grant," and silently absorbing that could mask a caller's
  wrong belief about how much it actually holds. `nav.rs`'s own existing doc comment already states
  the principle this extends: "the dangerous refusal is the one that answers." Declined.
- **Hop to the other tree's root on `..`.** The one place this would start behaving like a real
  union of the two trees rather than two disjoint labeled ones, and it buys nothing a process
  cannot already do with one absolute-path `cd`. No real prior art found for this shape either
  (checked against Plan 9's `bind` and standard bind-mount unions, neither of which special-cases
  `..` this way). Declined.

**Refuse, unchanged from the one-grant case, applied per-tree**, wins: it is nife's own existing
answer to the same question at smaller scope, it is no more code than the alternatives, and the
capability-boundary reasoning that motivated the one-grant refusal in the first place applies
identically to two.

**Starting position**: the first-listed grant's own root (`which = A`), matching the existing
"slot 0 is always the first grant" precedent [milestone 154](../roadmap/154-multi-directory-namespace.md)
already established for cspace ordering. No new precedent needed.

## What this does not decide

[Milestone 47](../roadmap/47-navigation-and-naming.md)'s four open questions (unions and shadowing
across more than two labeled sources, enumeration, the compile-time-set-to-runtime-lookup gap,
whether `$PATH` survives as a string) remain exactly as open as they were. This decision is
narrower than any of them: two disjoint, individually-labeled trees, one position at a time, no
name ever meaning two different things. `grant_plan::Holdings`'s extension to carry this pair, and
`plan_stage`/`redirect_target`'s and `caps`'s use of it, are implementation, not decided here.

## What it unblocks

The `(which, pos)` design gives whoever builds the rest of [milestone
154](../roadmap/154-multi-directory-namespace.md)'s "still open" list (extending `caps`'s display,
the shell-to-init spawn-protocol encoding) a real state shape to extend `Holdings` with, rather
than an open question to re-raise.
