# 180. Whether `components/` splits again, for the tools a person invokes

**Status: PROPOSED.** Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice-c lane, which found milestone 395's
`DECISION` gate naming no section. Milestone 175 asked this question in its own block and correctly
did not answer it, because the answer is a top-level directory name. *(Section number provisional
until the merge queue lands it.)*

## What is being decided

Three things, and the first decides whether the other two are asked at all:

1. **Does a third category exist**, or is "component" deliberately the broad word and a `tools/`
   directory would invent a distinction the capability model does not have?
2. **What it is called**, if it exists.
3. **Where `swish` goes**, since a shell runs the tools rather than being one of them, and is as
   plausibly the spine.

## Is the premise true

Checked 2026-09-19 in this worktree. `components/Cargo.toml` carries **47** `[[bin]]` entries and
`fixtures/Cargo.toml` **40**, so the split milestone 175 performed is real and current. Fifteen of
the components are not services:

| | |
|---|---|
| read one thing, print it, exit | `date`, `printenv`, `uptime`, `uuid` |
| look at the running system | `ps`, `pgrep`, `pmap` |
| operate on what the command line designates | `wc`, `rm`, `mdr`, `rmle` |
| operator tools, run once on purpose | `disk_surveyor`, `disk_partitioner`, `identity_provisioner`, `swapper` |

**Nine of the fifteen are typeable at the prompt.** `grant_plan::Prog::from_name` resolves `date`,
`rm`, `wc`, `mdr`, `ps`, `pgrep`, `uptime`, `printenv` and `uuid`, which is the closest thing this
tree has to a `/bin`. Milestone 395's own block corrects two earlier figures here: `watch` was cut
by milestone 281 and `doc` was ratified as `mdr`.

## What this tree already does in the analogous case

**§39 defines the vocabulary and does not force this.** A **component** is the shippable unit, a
binary plus its manifest; a **service** is what it offers; a **contract** is the wire protocol.
`wc` is a shippable unit with a manifest. It offers no service, and nothing in §39 requires it to.
So `components/` holding `wc` is **coarse rather than wrong**, which is the honest case against a
third directory: a coarse-but-correct directory is a much smaller defect than a name taken without
the person who owns names.

**§63 draws the tree's other line in this area** (a crate is the logic, a program is the authority)
and it cuts across this one rather than along it, so it neither supports nor refuses a third
directory.

**§75 is the mechanism a new directory would owe**: a directory under `design/` or `notes/` carries
its provenance in its own `README.md`. A top-level program directory is outside that rule's scope
today, which is itself worth noticing: `components/` and `fixtures/` carry no such record.

## Whether the name is available, read rather than recalled

**`tools/` is already spent.** `tools/redoxfs_host` exists in this worktree and is a host build
tool, which is a different meaning of the word. Taking `tools/` for EL0 programs would give one
directory name two senses, which is the ground §154 and naming.md's recognition argument already
refuse elsewhere (milestone 440's block makes the same refusal of `runner` on a measured 163 files).

The alternatives, so they are refused on the record rather than silently: `bin/` is Unix's and says
nothing about authority, which is the §39 failure wearing a different hat; `commands/`,
`programs/` and `utilities/` are each one of the generic words naming.md names as a failure mode.

## What it costs, measured

Milestone 175 performed the same work at four times the scale and priced it: **about an hour.**
Fifteen `git mv`s, fifteen `[[bin]]` blocks moved between manifests, one more dependency set to
prune, a third four-line `build.rs` pointing at `crates/user_mode_runtime/link.ld` like the other
two, and roughly 150 path citations to repoint.

**Doing it later costs the repoint twice**, which is milestone 175's own argument for folding the
`interrupt_heeder`/`interrupt_ignorer` renames into the change that moved the files.

## Recommendation

**None on question 1, because it is a name, and a directory name is the most expensive kind in this
tree**: it lands in `xtask`, in four exclusion lists, in `script/lint`, `script/names` and
`script/verify`, and in every citation that points into it. AGENTS.md's rule is that a fork this
irreversible arrives with options rather than with a winner.

What this section does recommend is the sequencing: **if question 1 is yes, it should happen soon
rather than eventually**, because a reader meets a directory before they meet anything in it, and
`notes/adding-a-program.md` already spends a paragraph saying that `wc.rs` and `net_stack.rs` are
not the same kind of thing.

## What this does not decide

Whether `net_transport` is lifted into a crate (milestone 175 left it open), and whether `crates/`
takes §39's three-audience split, which §39 named as a separate strain and 175 refused to fold in.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Milestone 395**, and nothing else. The tree is correct as it stands; what it is not is legible to
a newcomer at the directory level.
