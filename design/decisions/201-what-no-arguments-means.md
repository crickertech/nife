# 201. What `script/ci-build` with no arguments means, and what the two tiers are called

**Status: PROPOSED.** Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice-c lane, which found milestone 400's
`DECISION` gate naming no section. The mechanism is built and shipped under the recommendation
below; only the spelling and the default are open. *(Section number provisional until the merge
queue lands it.)*

## What is being decided

Milestone 286 collapsed two enumerations of "the checks that gate a pull request" into one table
inside `script/ci-build`, one row per check with a tier. Two things in it are calef's:

1. **What "no arguments" means.** A contributor meets this in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and in
   `.github/pull_request_template.md` as the one command to remember.
2. **What the two tiers are called.** The tag appears in `--list` output and in every row.

## Is the premise true

Checked 2026-09-19 in this worktree. Yes. `script/ci-build`'s table carries **17 rows, 9 `local` and
8 `ci`**, the no-argument path runs the `local` tier in the table's order, and the script's own
header says in capitals at line 37 that **the tier tags and the no-argument meaning are PROVISIONAL
pending calef**.

## Why it cannot mean everything

`script/verify` is about 47 minutes of Kani. `script/cpu-matrix` is five QEMU boots of the riscv64
suite. `script/coverage` instruments and re-runs the whole host suite, and `script/fuzz` is 60
seconds per target by construction.

The retired `script/gates` carried the sentence that decides this and it has to survive the
milestone that deleted the file: **a gate people skip is not a gate.** A command that took an hour
would be run once, by whoever wrote it. So the no-argument path is a subset, and the only question
is how the subset is named and defended.

## The options for the default

| | what "no arguments" means | how the subset is decided | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | the `local` tier | a tier tag, one column | shipped; one word per row |
| **B** | everything, with `--fast` for the subset | inverted | the default becomes an hour, which is what the retired script refused |
| **C** | everything the machine can do now | derived from the host | no tag, and the set depends on the contributor's laptop |
| **D** | nothing; require a name every time | no subset exists | deletes the one command to remember |

**C is the tempting one and fails on the third principle rather than on mechanism.** It removes a
hand-maintained tag, which is what milestone 286 was about. But two contributors would run different
sets from the same command and neither could say what the other's green meant. The `hvf` row already
shows the shape: it skips loudly where Hypervisor.framework does not exist and says in plain words
that nothing executed on a physical core. One such row is a recorded gap; seventeen would be a
lottery.

## The tags, and the refusals, which are the useful half

Shipped provisionally as **`local`** and **`ci`**.

- **`local` / `ci`.** `local` says who waits, a person at a checkout; `ci` says the same of a runner.
  **The strongest argument against the pair is that `ci` names a deployment rather than a property
  of the check.** Nothing about `script/coverage` changes if this repository stops using GitHub
  Actions, and the tag would be wrong that day while the check was untouched. `local` is separately
  one of the vaguest words available in an operating system.
- **`runner` is not available**, and this is a lookup rather than a preference. This tree already
  spends the word in two senses, the CI machine and a script that runs something, across **163
  files** (`git grep -lw runner`, measured 2026-09-13), including four entry points named for it:
  `scripts/qemu-runner-aarch64.sh` and its two siblings, `scripts/memory-bounded-runner.sh`, and
  `script/runner-container`. A third sense costs a reader the recognition, which is the ground §31
  already refused `witness` on.
- **`before-push` / `ci-only`.** Says what a contributor does rather than where it happens. Against:
  two hyphenated compounds where a column wants a word, and `before-push` names a git hook that
  already exists (`.githooks/pre-push`) and runs a different, smaller set.
- **`fast` / `slow`.** Refused, and false in both directions: `image-permissions` is `local` and
  builds three kernels, `supply-chain` is `ci` and takes seconds on a warm cache. The real criterion
  is what a person will wait for, which is not a duration.
- **`gate` / `report`.** Refused: **§134** already spends that split on the `script/` family itself
  (what does something is a verb, what reports is a noun), and reusing the words one level down
  would make `coverage` a report in one sense and a gate in another on the same page.

**The noun rule does not reach this**, and the misreading is corrected here rather than deleted
because it is easy to make. `design/naming.md` governs crates, programs and shared modules, and a
value in a table column is none of the three; this tree's own enum variants already sit where verbs
are right (`Direction::Serve`, `Direction::Use`). So the case against the shipped pair rests on `ci`
naming a deployment, not on its part of speech.

## What each option costs, measured

- **A costs one word per row**, on seventeen rows, and nothing else.
- **The drift A prevents was measured on 2026-09-13**, before the change: three prose comments in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, a row in `notes/scripts.md` and two contributor-facing sentences all
  described the local set, and **four of the six were wrong**. `ci.yml` said `script/icount` was not
  in it (milestone 62 put it there). `notes/scripts.md` listed four checks where the script ran six.
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the pull-request template both said "five". Every one had been correct when
  written.
- **C costs nothing to build and costs the third principle**, which is the expensive currency here.

## Recommendation

**Keep A as the default.** On the tags, this section deliberately names no winner, because a tag a
contributor learns is a name and names are calef's; what it offers is the refusals with their
reasons, which is the half that is a lookup rather than an argument.

## How reversible, and who has acted on it

**The tags are high, the default is not**, and they should be answered as two questions rather than
one. The tags appear in one column of one table, in `--list` output and in three sentences of prose,
so renaming them is one commit and touches no wire format and no syscall. The default is already in
`CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/pull_request_template.md` telling a stranger this is the one command
to remember, and a contributor who learns it and then finds it means something else is the expensive
half of *move fast on what can be undone*.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Nothing.** The tags are provisional and say so in three places. Milestone 400 is the only thing
waiting, and a `**Proposed.**` bullet in milestone 286's block points at it.
