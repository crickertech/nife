# 148. Milestone 105's two forks: a supervisor restarts by asking, and resolves by asking the kernel

**Status: DECIDED.** calef, 2026-09-05, on milestone 105's two forks, taken one at a time.
*(Section number provisional until the merge queue lands it. §147 was minted the same day by
milestone 263's lane.)*

Milestone 22 recorded both in `notes/trusted-init.md` as *"calef's call, not a thing to slip in"*,
and milestone 105 stated them precisely and picked neither on purpose. This is the ruling.

## Fork one: no reap-only right. Tier one adopts tier two's pattern

**Decided: neither a new rights bit nor an `Untyped::REAP` method.** A tier-one server that should
be restartable gets a spawner, and the root asks it, which is what tier two already does.

### Why, and the check that moved it

The fork was put as *"are reclamation and construction separable rights"*, and the answer is that the
tree does not need them to be, because **it already restarts a child without construction
authority**. `components/src/sub_server_supervisor.rs`:

> **restart policy, in userspace, holding nothing**... cannot make an endpoint, cannot allocate a
> page. **Its entire power is to ask the spawner for a rebuild of the one program the spawner can
> build.** A compromised supervisor is a restart loop, not a foothold.

**And the pattern generalises**, which was checked rather than assumed, because it was the one
objection that would have sunk it. `components/src/spawner.rs` holds one untyped budget (`WRITE` only, so
it may spend but never lend), a request channel, and **one program image copied in by
`root_supervisor`**: *"the only program it can name is the one it was handed."* The image is handed
in by the root, so the root already has the machinery to do this for a tier-one server. The memory
model already survives restart loops: each instance is built in its own region split off the budget,
and a LIFO reap returns the pages, *"so a restart loop is not a leak."*

**The authority is bounded more tightly than a right would bound it.** A bit says *may reap*. A
one-program spawner says *may only ever produce this*.

### The prior art, read rather than recalled, because the two relatives disagree

**Zircon has 25 rights** and splits both of these: `ZX_RIGHT_ENUMERATE` (*"Allows enumerating child
objects"*) and `ZX_RIGHT_DESTROY` (*"Allows termination of task objects via `zx_task_kill()`"*), read
2026-09-05 at `fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel/rights`. **The page states no design principle
for the granularity**, so it is an existence proof rather than an argument, and 25 is where the
add-a-bit path ends.

**seL4 has four** (Read, Write, Grant, GrantReply) and solves this exact problem structurally, with no
right at all. Its manual: *"The revoke method removes all capabilities (in all CSpaces) that were
derived from a selected capability... [used] by managers of untyped memory to destroy the objects in
that memory so it can be retyped."* Authority comes from having derived the capability.

**seL4's answer is not available here and that is on purpose.** [§13](13-frame-revocation.md)
declined the capability-derivation tree as *"a considered terminal design, not a way-station"*,
revoking all derivatives rather than a subtree, because *"the full tree buys subtree granularity,
which nothing on the roadmap needs."* Taking seL4's route would mean reopening §13, which is larger
than a rights bit and was not what the fork asked.

### What was refused, and the reason each lost

- **A `REAP` rights bit.** [`ENUMERATE`](../../crates/capability/src/lib.rs)'s own precedent is real
  (milestone 126 split it out of `READ`, and its doc comment records that `READ` wrongly authorised
  `REAP` on a rendezvous), and there are 28 unused bits, so the structural cost is nil. It lost on a
  check: **`REAP` alone buys cleanup, not restart.** Rebuilding needs `RETYPE`, which needs `WRITE`,
  so a reap-only root turns *"report and stop"* into *"reap and stop"* and does not gain the
  supervision property the milestone was reaching for.
- **An `Untyped::REAP` method needing less than `WRITE`.** Same defect, and it makes the authority
  invisible to anything that inspects capabilities, including `caps`.
- **Closing the fork with the floor as correct.** `root_supervisor`'s own comment says *"a root that
  can restart is a root that can build, and the fail-closed floor is the more valuable of the two"*,
  which is true and is now beside the point: the root does not have to be the builder.

### The constraint this ruling carries, and it is not optional

**A supervision endpoint and a spawner land together, per server, or neither does.**
`notes/trusted-init.md` is explicit that half of it is worse than none:

> The boot servers are not supervised. Endowing them a supervision endpoint **with nobody to restart
> them would make their corpses persist forever** instead of being reaped by the kernel, which is
> strictly worse.

**The cost accepted.** One spawner per restartable tier-one server, each holding `WRITE` on its own
budget, so total construction authority is spread across more processes rather than concentrated in
one root. That is a real trade and calef took it knowingly: each spawner is about as narrow as a
builder can be, and the count is bounded by how many tier-one servers are worth restarting.

## Fork two: `ThreadControlBlock::RESOLVE`, and not deferred

**Decided: the kernel owes a supervisor the ability to resolve the identity it already sends.** Not
deferred, and not left to a userspace protocol between builder and supervisor.

### Why not deferred, which was the live alternative

**The multi-child supervisor already exists.** `components/src/root_supervisor.rs` builds **two** children
with `fault: Some(rootfault)` on the same endpoint and then sits in `recv(rootfault)` receiving
`(event, tid, _pc)`. Milestone 105 says the problem *"does not generalize"* to a supervisor with
several children; it does not generalise to the supervisor the tree already ships.

**And deferral would have been a decision for the workaround, made by inaction.** The workaround
already exists: milestone 105 records `sub_server_supervisor` naming instances *"by a handle the
spawner issues instead"*. Milestone 23 would have baked that in.

**This tree has that failure on record from the same day.** Milestone 106's fork stood from
2026-08-04, and in the meantime `net_stack` shipped `wait_for_nic` yielding and re-polling, which
**burns a core through every retransmit backoff** and is now the thing in production. A fork routed
around rather than settled gets expensive, and both 106's block and milestone 51's warn in those
words against settling one by accident.

**The usual reason to be careful with syscall surface is weak here.** Milestone 105's own argument:
the method *"discloses nothing new: the tid is already in the fault message, so turning it into a
handle reveals no fact the supervisor did not receive."*

### The name, and what it is not

**`ThreadControlBlock::RESOLVE`**, in `abi::thread_control_block`. `Tcb` became
`ThreadControlBlock` under [§113](113-kernel-object-plain-names.md) with the reason *"acronym spelled out"*, which
is the rule calef set on the same day this was decided, applied before it was written down.

**`resolve` is the tree's own verb for this relation** rather than a coinage: `abi` says *"a stale
tid whose generational name no longer **resolves**"*, and `capability` says *"`None` if the thread
does not **resolve** at all, or **resolves** and is unsupervised."*

- **`NAME` refused**, which was milestone 105's provisional. It is ambiguous between *give this
  thread a name* and *tell me this thread's name*, and calef caught it.
- **`BADGE` refused** for a collision: seL4 uses it for capability badges and
  [§101](101-notification-objects.md) already names badged capabilities as a later fork here.
- **`LABEL` refused for now**, because it presumes the design below.
- **`IDENTIFY` refused** as a synonym that spends vocabulary the tree already has.

## What a lane must not decide by accident

**Whether `RESOLVE` returns a capability or an identifier.** Milestone 105 says only *"something a
builder holds"*. A capability is actionable and would be a larger power than the
discloses-nothing-new argument covers; a label the builder set at spawn discloses nothing.
**Milestone 126's lesson applies** (*enumeration is itself authority*), and the reading should be
argued rather than defaulted to.

**`RESOLVE` inherits `REAP`'s anti-probe design and must not undo it.** `abi`'s `REAP` collapses
every failure into one error on purpose:

> The two are deliberately one error, **so a supervisor cannot probe the tid space of children it
> does not supervise.**

A `RESOLVE` returning distinct errors for "not yours", "already collected" and "stale" would quietly
retire that. It is `REAP`'s query sibling: same tid, same supervision check, same single refusal.

## BUGS

- **Fork one is a ruling about a pattern, not a built thing.** No tier-one server has a spawner
  today, and the note's warning means the first one to get a supervision endpoint must get a spawner
  in the same change.
- **Fork two's method is named and unspecified.** What it returns is the design question above, and
  this section deliberately does not answer it.
- **The Zircon and seL4 readings are one page each**, taken 2026-09-05. Neither project's full
  rights model was studied, and the Zircon page's silence on rationale is reported rather than
  interpreted.
