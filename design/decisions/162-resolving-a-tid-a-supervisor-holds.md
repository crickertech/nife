# 162. Whether the kernel resolves a tid it already sent to the supervisor that received it

**Status: PROPOSED.** Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's lane, which found milestone 105 gated on
`DECISION` with no decision anywhere a reader can open. The block named two forks; **one of them
was already decided before the block was written**, which is recorded below rather than quietly
fixed. This decision is the other one. *(Section number provisional until the merge queue lands
it.)*

## The correction that comes first, because it changes what is owed

**Milestone 105's fork one is answered and built.** The block (2026-08-04) asks whether reclamation
and construction are separable rights, and proposes *"a new rights bit below `WRITE`, or a distinct
`Untyped::REAP` method."* [§32](32-reap-without-build.md) (a supervisor may collect a corpse
without being able to build one) decided it on **2026-07-29**, six days earlier, and decided it
better than either option: authorization is **the supervision relationship, not a rights bit and
not a registry.**

`crates/abi`'s `rendezvous::REAP` is that decision shipped. Its own documentation states the
property the supervision tree wanted and could not express (quoted from the doc comment on
`rendezvous::REAP`):

> A supervisor therefore needs no capability to the child's memory, and gains none: the reclaimed
> region returns to its owner under §13 region ownership, which is the **builder**. A supervisor can
> free a child's memory; it cannot spend it.

So the block restated a settled question as open. That is the defect milestone 435 exists to find,
and it is the more dangerous direction of it: a gate that says `DECISION` for a reason that has
been answered spends calef's attention on a decision he already made.

## What is being decided, which is fork two

**Whether the kernel owes a supervisor the ability to resolve the identity it already sends.** The
fault message names a dead thread by tid ([§26](26-fault-endpoint.md), thread death becomes a
message a supervisor holds). No method turns a tid into something the builder holds, so a
supervisor with several children receives a tid and cannot say which child it belongs to.

## Whether the premise is still true, measured 2026-09-19

**Yes, and the tree records it where a reader meets it.** There is no `NAME` method anywhere in
`crates/abi`. `crates/ps`'s own limits say it plainly, in its module documentation:

> A process has no name here, so there is no `CMD` column. This system has `arg0` in `Spawn` and no
> display name at all, so the columns are the tid and the run state and that is everything.

**One thing has moved and it narrows the question rather than answering it.** Milestone 126 added
`rendezvous::SURVEY`, which walks the supervision subtree and returns a tid and a run state per
entry, authorized by the same relationship `REAP` is. So a supervisor can now *enumerate* its
children's tids. It still cannot say which of them is the filesystem server, because nothing in the
kernel holds a name to return.

## The options

| | shape | cost |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | **`Tcb::NAME`**, a method turning a tid into a handle the builder set. | A new method within the established model. **Discloses nothing new**: the tid is already in the fault message, so this reveals no fact the supervisor did not receive. It does put a string, or a builder-chosen word, in the kernel, which is state the kernel does not keep today. |
| **B** | **Per-child fault endpoints.** | Already refused once by §26.5, and for a reason that has not changed: synchronous rendezvous means `RECV` blocks on one endpoint, so this costs a supervisor thread per child or a wait-any primitive that does not exist. |
| **C** | **The builder reports the tid it created**, over a userspace protocol. | No kernel change at all. It makes the supervision relationship depend on a protocol between builder and supervisor rather than on anything the kernel guarantees, and a supervisor that trusts a builder's report is trusting a party it may be supervising. |

**Recommendation: none, deliberately.** This is a syscall-surface question, which AGENTS.md puts in
the category that reaches calef as options rather than with a winner, because a recommendation on
the surface is most of the way to a decision. What can be said without deciding it is that the
argument between A and C is not about cost (C is free, A is a method) but about **who is trusted**,
and that is the question to rule on.

**What would make C safe** is worth naming as a third position: if the builder and the supervisor
are the same principal, C's objection evaporates entirely, and the tree's current tree runs one
sub-server at a time precisely because it has not had to answer this.

## How reversible it is

**A is the surface and is not reversible.** C is a userspace convention between two programs, which
is the *anything two programs agree on* category: cheaper than the surface, not free.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Milestone 105**, which is now one fork rather than two, and through it **milestone 23** (the
component OS with live replacement), which is the first consumer with more than one child. Nothing
else: the supervision tree runs one sub-server at a time today and the spawner-issued handle
`sub_server_supervisor` uses works for exactly that reason.
