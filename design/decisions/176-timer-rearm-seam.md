# 176. Where the timer re-arm seam goes, and which miss behaviour the kernel tick is meant to have

**Status: PROPOSED.** Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice B, which read milestone 360's
`DECISION` gate and found it naming no section. Milestone 197 named the fork and declined to take
it; the 2026-09-03 proposal sweep carried it forward. *(Section number provisional until the merge
queue lands it.)*

## What is being decided

`crates/timetable::next_after` is proved and **nothing on the kernel timer path calls it**. Its only
caller in the tree is `Timetable::due`, one function further down its own file. The re-arm
arithmetic the kernel actually runs is written inside the register access, once per architecture.

The decision is where the seam goes: too high and the arch layer keeps its own arithmetic, too low
and every ISA restates what the crate exists to hold.

## The two re-arms, side by side, which is what a lane could produce before a ruling

**Read on 2026-09-19.** Two architectures re-arm in software, not three:
`kernel/src/arch/aarch64/timer.rs::rearm` and `kernel/src/arch/riscv64/timer.rs::rearm`. x86_64 arms
the local APIC in periodic mode and the hardware reloads, so there is no software re-arm there to
lift.

| | aarch64 | riscv64 |
|---|---|---|
| `now` | `CNTVCT_EL0.get()` | `now()` |
| the deadline that fired | `CNTV_CVAL_EL0.get()` | `DEADLINE[id].load(Relaxed)` |
| the period | the `interval` parameter | `interval()` |
| ordinary case | `next = fired + interval` | `next = fired + interval()` |
| late case | `MISSED_TICKS += 1`, then `next = now + interval` | `MISSED_TICKS[id] += 1`, then `next = now + interval()` |
| arming | `CNTV_CVAL_EL0.set(next)` | `DEADLINE[id].store(next)`, `sbi_set_timer(next)` |

**The signature question the block poses is already answered.** Milestone 360 asks what
`next_after`'s signature would have to become to serve all three, *"a deadline, a delta, or a raw
counter value"*. Both software re-arms already hold exactly the three values it takes, all `u64`:
`fired` is `prev`, `interval` is `period`, and `now` is `now`. `pub const fn next_after(prev: u64,
period: u64, now: u64) -> u64` serves both without changing.

## The premise is not quite true, and this is the part that decides the fork

Milestone 360 says `next_after` *"computes the same thing"* as the re-arm. **It does not, on the
late path, and the difference is the whole argument.**

`next_after` keeps the **phase**: its documented second property is that the result is congruent to
`prev` modulo `period`, *"so an entry that drifted late because the machine was busy comes back onto
its original beat instead of inheriting the delay forever"*. The kernel's re-arm, on a missed tick,
sets `next = now + interval`, which **leaves the grid permanently**.

That grid is the point of the register choice milestone 6 made. `kernel/src/arch/aarch64/timer.rs`'s
own header states it: re-arming from a relative countdown made *"100 Hz configured, ~70 Hz
observed"*, and `CVAL` was chosen because *"the deadlines sit on a fixed grid. A slow handler makes
one tick late; it does not make the next one late as well."*

**So the kernel holds the grid in the ordinary case and abandons it on exactly the case the grid was
chosen for.** It is bounded (one shift per missed tick, and missed ticks are counted), and it is the
residue of the defect milestone 6 fixed rather than a new one. It is also the reason this is a fork
rather than a refactor: **lifting `next_after` in as it stands changes kernel behaviour**, and
whether that change is wanted is the question underneath "where does the seam go".

## The options

| | shape | cost |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Lift the arithmetic only.** Each `rearm` reads its registers, calls `next_after(fired, interval, now)`, and arms. Lateness is detected by the arch layer with one comparison it already makes. | The smallest change that binds the proof, and it fixes the grid on the late path for both ISAs at once. It changes behaviour, so the drift test and `miss_detail` need re-reading rather than assuming. |
| **B** | **Lift the arithmetic and the miss accounting**, so the crate answers with both the next deadline and whether it was late, and the arch layer only reads and writes registers. | Binds more of the code to a proof. `MISSED_TICKS` and the `#[cfg(test)] miss_detail::record` are per-CPU kernel state, so the crate would return a verdict rather than own the counter, which is one more thing on a boundary that exists to be thin. |
| **C** | **Leave it, and record the counterfactual where the reader meets it.** | Free. The standing cost is the one milestone 360 names: `script/verify` reports a green proof beside proofs that do bind, with no way for a reader to tell them apart, and the demonstrator's claim is a verified core. |

**No recommendation, deliberately.** The seam is *"the whole of the work rather than a detail of
it"*, and A carries a behaviour change to the kernel tick that is calef's rather than a lane's. What
this section does instead is put the two re-arms side by side and name the behaviour change, which
is what milestone 360 said a lane could produce before a ruling.

**If A, the prior question has to be answered first and in one sentence:** should a kernel tick that
arrives late come back onto its original beat, or start a fresh interval from where it woke up?
`next_after` answers the first; both `rearm`s answer the second.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Milestone 360.** Nothing else cites it. Three of `next_after`'s four properties are machine-checked
and the phase one is host-tested, and `crates/timetable/src/proofs.rs` says why in the place a reader
of the proofs would look, so the proof itself needs nothing from this.
