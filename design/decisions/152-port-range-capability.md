# 152. The port-range capability: object and method semantics on the syscall surface

calef, 2026-09-15, ratified the object, its one method, and the x86-only scope
together, when milestone 299 landed the working driver behind them. **Number provisional**, minted by a
lane against the current README; the integrator renumbers if the merge queue collides it. This section
records the one thing milestone 299 puts on the capability surface, because a new object type there is
calef's to ratify (§10, §16) and the *move fast on what can be undone* tenet files the syscall surface
under the irreversible category. **The provisional names for the object, its method, and their fields
are not ratified here** and stay on the worklist (`script/names`); calef takes those separately. DECISIONS §121 decided *that* x86 gets a port capability and *why* (the
reversal at the end of that file); this decides *what the object is and what invoking it does*, the
part §121 named but left for the milestone.

## What it names

`Object::PortRange(u16, u16)` names a contiguous run of x86 I/O ports, `(base, count)`. It is the
device-capability kind for the one class of device with no page: x86's legacy port-I/O hardware,
reached only by `in`/`out`, which the MMU cannot grant or deny because there is no page table in
front of the port space. It is the honest analogue of `Object::DeviceFrame`, which names a device's
MMIO page and is enforced by the MMU; `PortRange` names a device's ports and is enforced by the
CPU's **TSS I/O permission bitmap**.

- **The granularity is a range**, because a device occupies a run of consecutive ports (a 16550 UART
  is eight: COM1 is `0x3F8..=0x3FF`). A capability names what the hardware names, the port-space twin
  of a `DeviceFrame` naming a page, or a `PageFrame(base, count)` naming a run of frames.
- **`(u16, u16)`**, because a port number is 16 bits (`in`/`out` address exactly 64 Ki ports) and a
  count never exceeds that. The pair fits the capability enum's existing 16-byte payload, so the
  object does not grow a capability-table slot.
- **It is minted by the kernel**, once, at boot, the way a `DeviceFrame` is: only the kernel knows a
  machine's device ports. The progenitor is handed COM1's `PortRange(0x3F8, 8)` with `GRANT` and
  delegates it to the console and input drivers it builds.
- **The object is `x86_64`-only**, unlike `DeviceFrame` (which every architecture has, because MMIO
  is universal). Port I/O exists on no other architecture, so omitting it there is not a parity gap
  (§19), it is the absence of the hardware. Compiling the variant only where it exists also keeps a
  new enum arm off the other two architectures' syscall dispatcher, which the IPC round trip's
  instruction-footprint bound is measured against (`script/fastpath-footprint`): a variant present
  everywhere grew riscv64's dispatcher past that bound for hardware it can never name.

## What invoking it does

Almost nothing, on purpose: enforcement is at the context switch, not on the syscall path, so a
holder never invokes the capability to *use* the ports. It executes `in`/`out` directly, and the
kernel, on switch-in, writes the holder's ports into the current core's TSS bitmap so those `in`/`out`
are permitted from ring 3 and no others (the lazy write; see §121's 2026-08-25 refinement and
`notes/benchmarks.md`). A thread that holds no `PortRange` may touch no port at all.

The one method is **`PortRange::REVOKE`** (`abi::port_range::REVOKE`, method number 1), the take-back a
live driver replacement needs, with exactly `DeviceFrame`'s asymmetric semantics and for the same
reason: it deletes every `PortRange` capability naming this range from every **other** thread and
clears the cached grant, so those holders fault on their next `in`/`out`, while the caller keeps its
own. It needs `GRANT` (you were trusted to lend the ports on, so you may take them back). The
asymmetry is forced: the kernel mints a port capability once, at boot, so a symmetric revoke would
strand the device forever. No other method exists; `MAP` has no meaning for an object with no page.

## What it does not do

- **It does not replace `DeviceFrame`.** This is a *second* device-capability kind, for the one class
  with no page; PCI/PCIe devices, whose registers are memory, are unchanged and keep the mapping-based
  capability on all three architectures.
- **It does not add a syscall number.** `REVOKE` is a method on the existing `SYS_INVOKE` surface,
  within the established capability model, which is the bar §10/§16 set for a new method.
- **It does not give a way to *acquire* a port from userspace.** A `PortRange` is minted by the kernel
  and delegated (`CAP_INSERT`), narrowing rights, exactly like `DeviceFrame`; there is no retype-into-
  a-port, because a program cannot conjure hardware it was not handed.

## Names, ratified 2026-09-15

calef ratified the names in one pass, walking them by exposure. Two are renames the lane's first draft
carried and this section records as performed, so a reader meets the ratified name only:

| name | what it is | note |
|---|---|---|
| `PortRange` | the object variant | twin of `PageFrame`/`DeviceFrame` |
| `abi::port_range` | the ABI method module | `snake_case` of `PortRange`, mirrors `page_frame` |
| `port_range::REVOKE` | the one method | matches `page_frame::REVOKE`'s take-back |
| `port_range_grant` | the per-thread field | **renamed from `port_grant`**, for the shared `port_range` stem |
| `set_port_range_grant` | the arch setter | **renamed from `set_port_grant`**, same reason |
| `revoke_port_range` / `_from_others` | the revoke.rs functions | verb, matches the revoke family |
| `X86_COM1_PORT_BASE` / `_COUNT` | COM1's ports (`0x3F8`, 8) | arch prefix, standard `COM1`, `PortRange`'s fields |
| `outb` / `inb` | userspace byte port I/O | the universal x86 term, the `elf`/`pci` case |
| `port_range_cap` | the capability constructor | shares the stem |
| `port_out` / `recv_then_port_out` | hand-assembled test fixtures | describe what each tiny program does |

The stem `port_range` was chosen to keep the family greppable as one string, the argument that renamed
`port_grant`/`set_port_grant`: these are internal symbols nobody types, so brevity buys nothing and the
shared stem buys a `git grep port_range` that finds the object, module, method, field, setter and
constructor together.

## BUGS

- **A thread caches one port range, not a set.** The grant the context switch reads
  (`Thread::port_range_grant`) is set at the one choke point a `PortRange` enters a thread
  (`thread_control_block_insert_cap`) and holds the *last* range inserted. Every real consumer holds
  exactly one (a console driver holds COM1), so this is within the design's pinned consumer, but a
  thread handed two disjoint ranges would reach only the second. Widening it to a small set is a
  future change with an obvious shape; it is not built because nothing needs it.
- **A `PortRange` delegated to an already-running thread by `SEND_CAP` is not cached.** The grant is a
  creation-time fact, set when an embryo is endowed, the same posture `cycle_counter_grant` takes.
  Runtime delegation to a live thread would leave the switch installing the old grant until the next
  insert-through-the-choke-point. No consumer does this.
- **Revocation reaches one core, and since 2026-09-17 that is a window rather than a non-issue.**
  This entry used to end *"the stale-bitmap window a multi-core machine would have does not exist"*,
  on the premise that x86 runs a single core because `smp::bring_up_secondaries` refuses there.
  **`smp::seat_cpus_from_acpi` made that premise false**, and the conclusion inverted with it:
  milestone 313's security audit found the reset still core-local while the tour boots two cores
  under OVMF and four on xenon, so a revoked holder running on another core keeps that core's TSS
  bitmap until its next context switch, **at most one tick**, during which its `in`/`out` succeed
  against a capability that no longer exists.

  **The audit accepted the window rather than fixing it**, with its reason: it is bounded, it cannot
  reopen, and no consumer holds a port on two cores today. The limitation is recorded where a reader
  meets the code, in a `BUGS` section at
  `arch::x86_64::segments::revoke_installed_port_grant`, and the closing move is
  `design/roadmap/proposals/a-port-revoke-that-reaches-every-core.md`.

  **What this entry got right is the part worth keeping**: the core-local reset was written as the
  step a future SMP x86 would broadcast by IPI, the shape of the TLB shootdown this tree already
  has, so the generalization is a broadcast rather than a redesign. That held. Only the sentence
  claiming the window did not exist was wrong, and it was wrong because a fact about another
  subsystem changed underneath it.
