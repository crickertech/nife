# 181. May `script/bootstrap` say "installed everything I could, and this machine is still not good enough" without failing?

Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice-c lane, which found milestone 397's
`DECISION` gate naming no section. *(Section number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

## What is being decided

`script/bootstrap` does two jobs. Its header promises one: *"it checks for what is already present
and installs only what is missing, so it is cheap to re-run and safe to call."* After installing, it
calls `script/qemu-check`, which asks whether the QEMU on `PATH` is **new enough** to boot this
kernel and exits non-zero when it is not.

**Installing what is missing and judging whether what is present is adequate are different
questions that fail in different ways.** The decision is whether they split, and if they do, how a
caller asks for one without the other.

## Is the premise true

Checked 2026-09-19 in this worktree. Yes: the header is unchanged, and `script/bootstrap:174` runs
`if ! script/qemu-check; then`, with a second `script/qemu-check` at line 200 after the Linux
source-build fallback.

**One figure in milestone 397's block is low, and correcting it strengthens its own case.** It says
four callers read this exit code. Measured here, the callers that actually read it are
`script/ci-build:267`, `script/runner-container:139`, `script/setup:18`, `script/update:18`, and
**three separate `- run: script/bootstrap` steps in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`** (lines 229, 330,
567). `setup` and `update` both run under `set -e`, so a non-zero bootstrap ends them where they
stand.

**And the measurement the proposal was built on has weakened**, which is worth separating from the
shape. Milestone 287 gave the Linux arm a source-build fallback, so a Linux box with a too-old
packaged QEMU now builds the pinned one and re-checks rather than exiting 1, which was the exact
container failure that prompted this. What survives is the shape: macOS has no fallback and still
exits 1 from inside a provisioning step, and so does any Linux box where `script/ci-qemu` cannot
run.

## What this tree already does in the analogous case

**§134 wrote down the `script/` family's own split**: what *does* something is a verb (`verify`,
`test`, `fuzz`, `bench`) and what *reports* is a noun (`names`, `citations`, `decisions`, `roadmap`,
`coverage`, `mutation`). `bootstrap` is a verb and `qemu-check` is already its own entry point.
Under that split, an adequacy verdict is not `bootstrap`'s to render; it is a check, and since
milestone 286 the place a check lives is a row in `script/ci-build`'s table.

**§97 is the posture one level out**: six gates run on every pull request and none of them can stop
one. A verdict that ends the whole local tier before any check has run is the opposite arrangement,
and milestone 286 made it loud rather than silent precisely because a lane could fix that half
without a ruling.

## The options, with what each one costs

| | what | cost |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | leave it; the loud message is enough | zero, and the developer on a stale machine keeps typing three commands by hand |
| **B** | `script/bootstrap --no-verify`, passed by `script/ci-build` | one flag, and the judgement moves into a caller that has no opinion about QEMU versions |
| **C** | split: `bootstrap` provisions and returns zero when it installed everything it could; adequacy becomes its own row in `script/ci-build`'s table | changes what a canonical entry point's exit code means, which seven call sites read |
| **D** | keep both jobs, distinguish the exit codes (1 for "could not install", 2 for "installed, still inadequate") | small; callers that do not look still see non-zero, and one that cares can |

**Measured on milestone 286's container**: packaged QEMU is 8.2.2, which lacks `riscv-iommu-pci`
(§20, milestone 16b). `script/bootstrap` installed nothing, broke nothing, found everything present
and exited 1 on the adequacy check, while `script/ci-build fmt`, `lint` and `image-permissions` all
pass perfectly well on that machine. The no-argument path runs none of them.

## Recommendation

**C**, and the reason is §134 rather than tidiness: an adequacy check renders a verdict, it is
cheap, and the table is where a verdict lives now. Most of C is wiring, because `script/qemu-check`
already exists as its own entry point.

**Its real cost, and C must not pay it silently**: `script/setup` and `script/update` get the
adequacy verdict for free today, and the newcomer running `script/setup` on a fresh machine is
exactly the reader that check was written for. C has to keep telling them, which means `setup` and
`update` calling the check explicitly rather than inheriting it.

**D is the cheap one and should be priced honestly as cheap.** It does not fix the conflation; it
makes it legible to one caller. If the answer is "not worth a split", D is better than A, and
saying that in those words is AGENTS.md's rule about an argument from effort.

**B is refused unless calef wants it**, because it puts "is this machine good enough" in the caller,
and the caller is a table of checks that has no opinion about QEMU versions.

## How reversible, and who has acted on it

**Medium.** No wire format and no name a stranger has learned, so the code is an afternoon either
way. What is not free is the exit-code contract: seven call sites read it, three of them in CI, and
a change that makes a previously fatal condition non-fatal cannot be noticed by a caller that was
written before it.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Nothing.** Milestone 286 shipped, the failure is loud, and the workaround is three commands a
developer can type. This is a sharpness problem rather than a correctness one, and milestone 397 is
the only thing waiting.
