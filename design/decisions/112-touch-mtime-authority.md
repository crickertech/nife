# 112. `touch`'s two behaviors need two rights: write covers "now", a separate right covers "arbitrary"

**Status: DECIDED.** calef, 2026-08-23, agreeing with the recommendation on milestone 47's own named
fork: *"I agree with your recommendation."*

## The question

`touch` does two different things to a file's mtime: set it to *now*, and (`touch -t`) set it to
*whatever the caller says*. Milestone 47 names the second as the ability to lie about history,
significant for anything reasoning from mtime, backups included. The question left open: is "set to
now" the same right as "set to an arbitrary value," and does the file's write right already cover
both, or does the second need something more?

## The decision

**No, they are not the same right.** Plain **write** covers setting mtime to now. **Setting an
arbitrary value needs a separate right**, not folded into write.

## Why, and the two independent precedents that converge on it

**POSIX already drew this exact line**, checked rather than assumed: `utime()`'s semantics
distinguish setting to the current time (ordinary write permission suffices) from setting an
arbitrary timestamp (the caller must *own* the file; write permission alone is not enough). The
reason POSIX splits it this way is the same reason this milestone names: setting to now only records
something already true and independently observable; setting to an arbitrary value is an assertion
nothing bounds. [utime(3p) POSIX](https://www.unix.com/man_page/posix/3p/utime/),
[utime(2) Linux](https://www.man7.org/linux//man-pages/man2/utime.2.html).

**And it lands exactly on this tree's own precedent, one level down, which is what the milestone's
own text predicted** ("that is §43's asymmetry again... one level down"). §43 already treats reading
the clock as broadly grantable and setting it as a separate, more tightly held authority (a distinct
writable page from the read-only one). `touch`'s two behaviors are the same shape applied to one
file's timestamp: "now" is bounded by what the clock already says and cannot lie; "arbitrary" is
bounded by nothing.

## The shape of the fix

Follows the same separable-rights-ladder pattern this milestone already uses for a directory
capability (`enumerate`, `open` read/write, `create`, `remove`, each grantable independently: "a
program handed a directory to write logs into should not thereby be able to delete what is there").
`touch -t` needs its own grant, distinct from and in addition to `WRITE`, the same way `REMOVE` is
already distinct from `WRITE` on a directory rather than implied by it.

## What this does not decide

The exact name and wire shape of the new right (a new `fs_proto` bit, its place in the rights ladder
alongside `enumerate`/`open`/`create`/`remove`) is left to whoever builds `touch`, not decided here.

## What it unblocks

Milestone 47's `touch` section can now be built to a concrete spec: `CREATE` for the create-if-absent
half (already expressible today), `WRITE` for bumping mtime to now, and a new, separate right for
`touch -t`'s arbitrary-value half.
