# 182. Is a string two binaries agree on a name for `script/names`' purposes, or is it data?

Raised 2026-09-19 by milestone 435's slice-c lane, which found milestone 398's
`DECISION` gate naming no section. The finding itself is milestone 283's: its gate fired on a record
nobody knew was there. *(Section number provisional until the merge queue lands it.)*

## What is being decided

`script/names` enumerates four kinds of named thing: a crate, a program, a `script/` entry point and
a Cargo package. A fifth kind carries provenance at the thing exactly as milestone 115 asks, on a
surface nothing has ever listed. The decision is **whether that surface is in scope**, and it is a
scope question rather than a mechanism one: scope decides how long the worklist calef is handed
becomes.

Three sub-questions follow from a yes, and they are why this is not one line:

1. **Is a wire string a name here, or data?**
2. **Where does its provenance block live?** Not the file header: milestone 283 made that spelling
   mean *this file's* one block, which belongs to the crate, so a second one is unreachable by
   construction.
3. **How is the set enumerated?** The four existing kinds are a directory listing or a manifest
   walk. A wire string is a `const` in an arbitrary file, which is neither, and a scheme that cannot
   enumerate its own surface is the hole this section is about, one level in.

## Is the premise true

Checked 2026-09-19 in this worktree. Yes. `crates/measured_boot/src/lib.rs:303` carries

```rust
pub const PROGRAM_MEASUREMENTS: &str = "program_measurements";
```

under a comment saying in its own prose that the name is provisional, that it "sits outside the four
surfaces `script/names` enumerates", and why it deliberately does not wear the `Name:` spelling.
`script/names` still enumerates exactly those four.

`"program_measurements"` is an archive entry name: the kernel's trust root names it and init reads
it out of the archive at boot. **It is a string two programs agree on**, which AGENTS.md puts in the
expensive, hard-to-reverse category beside a wire format and an opcode number. It has a provisional
name, its author said so, and `--unratified` has never listed it.

## What this tree already does in the analogous case

**The `package` kind is the precedent and it is exact.** It was added on 2026-08-18 because
`script/names std_exerciser` had been answering *"neither a name in the tree nor a recorded
refusal"* for weeks about eight real packages, and the argument written at the time carries whole:
**a registry with a hole is worse than no registry, because it answers confidently about the names
it happens to cover.**

**And this gap is already a recorded limitation rather than an unknown.** `design/naming.md`'s BUGS
carries "Three surfaces, and the tree has more than three kinds of name", which tracks the closures
(directories by §75 in 2026-08-16, Cargo packages in 2026-08-18) and states plainly that types and
`scripts/` helpers are still uncovered. It also records a live casualty: `fs_maker` was resolved to
`mkfs` by whoever was mid-task, because `redoxfs_server/src/bin/` is a place nothing looks. That is
a `BUGS` entry, which under §71 is a fact rather than a plan, and this section is where it becomes a
plan or is refused on the record.

## What it costs, counted rather than asserted

**The counting is the cheap half and it now has a first answer.** `pub const <NAME>: &str` matches
**77** times across `crates/`, `components/`, `fixtures/` and `kernel/` in this worktree. That is an
**upper bound rather than the count**, because not all 77 are agreed between two binaries; many are
one crate's own strings.

For scale, `script/names --unratified` is **71 deep of 222** today, with 1 unrecorded and 27
recorded. So the widening under discussion is at most a doubling of the tree's named surface and
plausibly much less, which is the figure the scope question turns on.

The other candidate sets, unenumerated, which is itself the point: the `*_proto` crates' operation
names and error codes, which already carry blocks *for the crate* and not for the words on the wire;
and public function and method names, calef's since 2026-08-23 and counted by nothing, which
milestone 276's own `BUGS` already records.

## Recommendation

**Count before widening, and then choose between two answers rather than three.** The block that
became milestone 398 said this and it is right: if the real figure is a dozen, the answer is
probably a list in `design/naming.md` and no new machinery. If it is closer to 77, the answer is
probably that **wire strings are declared out of scope and the record says so on purpose**, the way
`unrecorded` is a first-class answer rather than a gap.

**No recommendation between those two**, because the choice is what size of worklist calef accepts,
which is not a lane's to price. What this section does refuse is the third option of leaving it
unstated: a hole nobody has decided to keep is the failure the `package` kind was added to fix.

## How reversible, and who has acted on it

**Mixed, and that asymmetry is the argument for deciding it.** The registry is cheap to widen or
narrow. The names it does not cover are the least reversible things in the tree, because they are
agreed between two binaries; every day a wire string goes unlisted is a day it can be shipped
provisionally and then inherited.

## What is blocked until this is answered

**Milestone 398.** Nothing else: `PROGRAM_MEASUREMENTS`' record is preserved in prose one hop from
the constant. What it does not have is a gate.
