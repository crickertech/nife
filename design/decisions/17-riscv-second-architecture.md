# 17. The second architecture: RISC-V, and the page-table format trait

The port to RISC-V (rv64, QEMU `virt`) is the first real test of rule #1 ("all architecture-specific
code lives under `arch/`"), an assumption held on faith since milestone 1. RISC-V over x86_64 because
it is clean-different rather than legacy-different: it exercises the HAL abstraction (a different
trap, paging, interrupt, and firmware model) without the real-mode / GDT / IDT / APIC / UEFI tax.
x86_64 is the third port. Full plan and findings: notes/riscv-port.md.

The port found the `arch/` boundary was **almost** complete, and each leak it exposed was pushed under
`arch/`, not bodged around:

- **`thread::Context`** was aarch64-register-shaped in portable code. Now arch-owned, behind
  intent-named constructors (`Context::for_kernel_thread`, `for_user_thread`); `thread.rs` names no
  register.
- **The userspace-entry path** (the EL0/U-mode trap frame, the enter-userspace glue, cache
  coherence) lived in `user.rs`. Now `TrapFrame::for_user_entry`, `arch::enter_user`,
  `arch::sync_icache`, `arch::current_sp` seams; the hand-written aarch64 demo programs are gated to
  aarch64 (RISC-V reaches U-mode through the ELF loader).
- **The `paging` crate** encoded the aarch64 descriptor format outright.

**Decision on `paging` (the significant one, calef steered it):** generalize behind a `PageFormat`
trait rather than duplicate the walk or write a separate RISC-V pager. `Flags` became a
format-neutral capability set (write / user / user-exec / kernel-exec / global / device) with the
same constructor and predicate API; the `Mapper` walk (`map`/`unmap`/`translate`) is written once and
generic over `F: PageFormat`; each format (`Aarch64`, `Sv39`) supplies only `LEVELS`, the half split,
and the handful of encode/decode operations. **The walk is proved once and the encoding proved per
format:** the aarch64 and Sv39 modules each carry Kani proofs of index-in-bounds, address/permission
separation, and the half split, and the shared walk inherits both. The alternatives (a duplicated
sibling module, or a fresh un-verified RISC-V pager) were rejected because only the trait gives RISC-V
paging the same formal verification aarch64 has, which is the demonstrator's whole point. The cost was
real (it touched a verified crate and every `Flags` consumer) but landed with aarch64 fully green.
Base Sv39 has no device-memory PTE bit, so `CAP_DEVICE` rides in an RSW (software) bit to keep the
`Flags` round-trip exact; real hardware would use Svpbmt. Portable code that must name the format (the
user-VA gate, the user `Mapper`) refers to `arch::mmu::Format`, so the choice lives in `arch/`.

**The whole capability core runs on RISC-V today.** Boot (higher-half Sv39, `.bss`, the `tp`
per-CPU register, an NS16550 console, the OpenSBI device-tree handoff), the MMU (fine-grained W^X
Sv39 tables + `satp`, the single-`satp` process model where every root carries the kernel high half),
traps (`stvec`, the `sscratch` dance, the syscall-ABI reconciliation), the SBI timer, the scheduler
and context switch, U-mode user programs making syscalls, a capability invocation (`SYS_INVOKE` →
lookup → rights check → endpoint SEND) from U-mode, **preemption** (the timer preempts a thread that
never yields, DECISIONS §5), and **a real compiled ELF at U-mode** (the `worker` Rust binary,
delivered as the initrd and run through the kernel's arch-neutral ELF loader, squares an input and
SENDs it home). The ELF step needed three small aarch64 assumptions closed: `user_rt` grew a RISC-V
syscall ABI (`ecall`+`a7`), the `elf` crate accepts the running kernel's machine (a symmetric,
cfg-selected `EXPECTED_MACHINE`, so each kernel refuses the other's binaries), and one trap
instruction in the program was arch-gated; the loader itself was already portable. The port surfaced two RISC-V-specific bugs worth recording: `tp` is
a general register, not a system register, so a U-mode trap must restore the kernel `tp` from a known
source rather than trust it (notes/riscv-port.md); and the shallow TCB entry path let a trap frame
placed at the top of the kernel stack overlap `enter_frame`'s own frame, fixed by placing the frame
below the live `sp`. **Userspace init builds the system too:** from a nifefs
archive holding `init` (a portable minimal builder) and `worker`, the kernel loads only `init`, maps
the archive into it, grants it a budget and a report endpoint, and `init` loads `worker` by name and
builds it as a child through the capability verbs, wiring it to the report. The kernel never touches
the child's bytes. That exercised the full userspace capability syscall surface on RISC-V.

**Device interrupts flow through the PLIC too:** a
keystroke raises the NS16550's line into the PLIC, which delivers a supervisor external interrupt;
the handler claims it, masks the source, and notifies the endpoint it is routed to, and a driver
blocked there wakes, reads the byte, and re-arms. This is the real second consumer the
interrupt-controller abstraction was waiting for.

**The last leak is closed.** The device driver moved to userspace (an unprivileged process holding
an `Irq` capability and a device mapping, running the seL4 `WAIT`/read/`SEND`/`ACK` loop), and its
ACK forced the interrupt-controller seam. Then `arch::irq` was extracted with two working consumers
behind it, the GIC and the PLIC, and `drivers::gic` was gated to aarch64. Every portable caller names
`arch::irq`; the only code naming `drivers::gic` is aarch64 arch code and `cfg(test)` aarch64 tests.
The order was deliberate: prove a real interrupt through the PLIC, then a userspace driver exercising
the ACK on both arches, then extract, so the abstraction was factored out of two exercised
controllers rather than guessed ahead of one.

**The RISC-V port is complete.** Every primitive that defines the kernel runs on both aarch64 and
RISC-V from one portable core: boot, the MMU, traps, the timer, the scheduler, preemption, U-mode
user programs, capability invocation, userspace-built processes, and device interrupts serviced by an
unprivileged userspace driver. Rule #1 held: the second ISA was a new `arch/` directory, not a diff
across the kernel, with no exceptions left in portable non-test code.
