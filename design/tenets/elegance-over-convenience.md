# Elegance and performance beat implementation convenience

*Appendix to [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), which carries the rule and its one-question test. This
file carries calef's framing, §92's worked example, and why agents moved the balance. Moved here
2026-09-23 (UTC) on calef's authorization, unchanged in substance.*

calef, 2026-08-16: **"We wouldn't be building this project out of convenience. This whole
enterprise is inconvenient."** Nobody writes a capability microkernel from the first instruction
because it was the easy way to get a file server. The whole thing is a bet that doing the harder
correct thing compounds, so an argument that reduces to "this option is less work to build"
is arguing against the project's reason for existing.

**The failure mode is not laziness, it is a recommendation that sounds like design.** The tell is
a case made in the vocabulary of architecture whose actual load-bearing clause is effort. §92 is
the worked example, recorded there on purpose: the caretaker-lifetime question got a first
recommendation (job membership) over the better one (supervision, §40's subtree death), and the
honest reason was that it was the smaller change to make. It took calef asking "why not option
2?" to surface that, and the better answer was not merely better, it was *simpler to live with*:
the chained case fell out for free instead of needing bookkeeping.

**The test, and it is one question.** *Would I still choose this if both options were the same
amount of work?* If the answer is no, the recommendation is about effort and must say so out
loud, in those words, so the reader can weigh it as effort rather than mistake it for judgment.

**Why the balance moved, and this is what makes the tenet current rather than pious.** Agents
made *code* dramatically cheaper: a subsystem can be rewritten in an hour. They made everything
code is measured against exactly as expensive as before, because a reader's understanding, a
constraint the next person inherits, a wire format two programs agree on, and a name in
somebody's head are all unchanged. So the thing convenience buys shrank by an order of magnitude
while the thing elegance buys held still. **An argument from implementation cost was always the
weakest one available here; it is now weaker than it has ever been.**

## What this does not license

**It is not a licence to gold-plate, and the difference is falsifiable.** Elegance here means the
option with fewer moving parts, fewer things to remember, and fewer places to be wrong. It does
not mean the option with more abstraction, more generality, or more machinery: those are usually
*less* elegant and always more to maintain. The tree already refuses speculative trait-ification
for exactly this reason, and §46 refuses a dependency taken for tidiness.

**Performance belongs in the sentence for the same reason.** A design that is slow is not elegant,
whatever it looks like on the page, and this project measures rather than argues (`script/bench`,
the icount tripwire, the honest ties). A recommendation that trades measurable performance for a
prettier structure owes numbers, not adjectives.

**And it does not overturn the tenet below.** *Move fast on what can be undone* is about how much
deliberation a decision deserves; this is about what you decide once you are deliberating. Deciding
quickly and choosing the harder-to-build option are not in tension: most of tonight's decisions
took minutes and several went to the more expensive answer.
