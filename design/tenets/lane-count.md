# What bounds lane count: the collision surface, the memory, and the disk

*Appendix to [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), which carries the rules for launching lanes and pruning
their worktrees. This file carries the measurement that overturned the old queue-depth rule, and the
three ceilings with the days each one was learned. The commands for a merge and its cleanup are in
[`briefs/merge-and-cleanup.md`](../../briefs/merge-and-cleanup.md); the queue machinery is in
[`notes/merge-queue.md`](../../notes/merge-queue.md). Moved here 2026-09-23 (UTC) on calef's
authorization, unchanged in substance.*

**Lane count is set against the collision surface, not against queue depth** (calef, 2026-08-16,
overturning his own 2026-08-04 delegation on measured evidence). The reason survives its own rule:
**throughput is measured in merged work.** What changed is what bounds it.

The old rule counted open pull requests, and was right when it was written: under
require-branches-up-to-date a serial drain landed **one thing at a time**, every merge staled every
other branch, and lanes past that rate manufactured merge debt. GitHub's merge queue, which is
milestone 119 (the merge queue is the bottleneck), enabled 2026-08-15, retired both facts. It lands
**groups of up to five in one CI run** and rebases the group itself, so a deep queue is a batch rather than a
backlog, and depth stopped predicting anything.

**The measurement that overturned it.** In the twenty hours after the queue went live: 28 merges
through 8 group builds, with four to five lanes running against a queue that sat six to twelve deep
for most of it. The old table would have prescribed **one** lane for nearly all of that night. Of
the four things that actually stalled the queue, three do not scale with lane count at all: a lint
that rejected GitHub's own synthetic branch names and so failed every group build (one bug, fixed),
evictions that GitHub does not auto-retry (queue behaviour, and the operator must re-enqueue), and
seven per-pull-request `rustfmt` failures (now caught by the pre-push hook). Only the fourth scales,
and it scales through **files rather than numbers**: four merge conflicts, every one of them in the
same small hotspot where every lane wires its test (`kernel/src/user/tests.rs`, the QEMU runners,
`xtask/src/main.rs`). Lanes in disjoint subsystems collided zero times.

So the question to ask before launching is not "how deep is the queue" but **"what files will this
lane touch, and who else is in them"**. Concretely:

- **Disjoint subsystems: launch freely.** Four is a reasonable working number, not a ceiling.
- **Two lanes in the test-wiring hotspot: expect to resolve a conflict by hand**, and brief the
  second one to fold into the first's shape rather than inventing a third. It is often cheaper to
  sequence those two than to merge them.
- **The real ceilings are elsewhere**, and they are worth naming so they are decided rather than
  discovered: the attention to read reports and resolve conflicts, the token budget, and runner
  concurrency, since group builds and per-branch CI compete for the same machines.

**And there is a second ceiling, which is the machine and not the collision surface** (2026-08-31,
learned three times in one day). Lane count is bounded by files; **concurrent heavy jobs are bounded
by memory**, and the two are independent. `script/verify` defaults to four parallel solver jobs
because its own header records a harness reaching **3.5 GB** and four fitting the dev Mac, so two
lanes gating at once is eight solvers against a budget tuned for four. That day cost an
out-of-memory kill that took the session with it, a `ci-build` whose timing assertions failed at
2.7x oversubscription and told nobody anything, and two `script/verify` runs killed by SIGTERM
mid-CBMC.

**So: at most one full `script/verify` at a time on this machine, and never a mutation sweep beside
lanes.** When two lanes must gate together, `VERIFY_JOBS=2` each shares the budget rather than
doubling it. The tell is the same every time and is easy to misread: a heavy job dying with no
failing assertion, reported as a cancellation or a timing failure rather than as memory.

**And a third ceiling, which was disk and is no longer the binding one** (2026-09-14, met four times
in one session; repriced 2026-09-22). Five lanes at roughly 3 GB of `target/` each, plus **7.2 GB in
the main checkout's own**, took a 252 GB volume to 1.9 GB free and then to a command failing
mid-write with `No space left on device`. Pruning fixed it, and what decides lane count now is the
memory and cores above. **So the lever moved with it: lanes gate in CI rather than here**
(`briefs/gate-in-ci.md`), which takes QEMU and `script/verify` off this machine and unbinds lane
count from 16 GB. The trade is wall-clock, 23 to 29 minutes a round, and **lanes are asynchronous**,
so it costs nothing a person waits for. Two habits survive the repricing: **run any local gate from
a lane's worktree rather than the main checkout**, the build tree nobody watches because it never
appears in `git worktree list`; and prune promptly, because disk is still the only pressure here
that destroys work rather than delaying it, and deletes keep succeeding while writes fail.

**The prover is the queue's long pole**, not the queue itself: a group's CI goes green while
`verify` is still running, every time. Milestone 119's remaining half is measuring exactly that.

**Prune a lane's worktree the moment its pull request merges**, and never prune one with uncommitted
work in it. Those are the two clauses that have to be known before the cleanup starts;
`briefs/merge-and-cleanup.md` has the commands, the order, and both recorded failures (eight
finished worktrees, one at 3.3 GB; and 2026-07-31's zero bytes free with 42 worktrees holding 78 GB,
which killed two lanes mid-work).
