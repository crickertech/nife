# Shared state: what a lane may not claim, and what a branch may not hold

*Appendix to [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), which carries the rules: anything global to the tree is
the integrator's at merge, a lane that gates takes the `nife-dev` link and says so, and a finding
lands in `notes/` rather than living on a branch. This file carries the collisions of 2026-07-30 and
the reason `fix/redoxfs-write-loop` survived a prune. The toolchain mechanism is in
[`notes/std.md`](../../notes/std.md) and the relink command is in
[`briefs/merge-and-cleanup.md`](../../briefs/merge-and-cleanup.md). Moved here 2026-09-23 (UTC) on
calef's authorization, unchanged in substance.*

**Anything global to the tree is assigned by the integrator at merge, never claimed by a lane.**
Concurrent lanes cannot see each other, so a lane that reaches for a shared resource is guessing.
Two kinds bit us on 2026-07-30:

- **`design/decisions/` section numbers**, three collisions in one day. Preferred: a lane **does not
  touch `design/decisions/` at all**, puts the reasoning in `notes/` and in its report, and the
  integrator mints the section at merge. (The calendar lane of milestone 51 (wall-clock time, the
  `date` command, and an NTP service) did exactly this, unprompted, and it was the only one of four
  that caused no conflict.) If a lane must write the section to make its own gates pass, the number
  is **provisional**: say so in the report, and expect renumbering.
- **Counts that span the tree.** The Kani harness count was written as 76 on one branch and 80 on
  another; the merged tree had 95. Both were counted honestly. Take such a number at merge, from the
  merged tree.

**Some shared state is global to the *machine*, not the repo**, and `rustup toolchain link` is the
one that has bitten: `nife-dev` is one symlink for the whole user account, so it means whichever
worktree ran `xtask std-src` last. **Every lane that gates takes it**, unavoidably, because
`script/test` calls `std_src()` transitively and a fresh worktree always has a cold farm. That is
expected: **do not tell a lane not to do the thing gating requires**, tell it to say in its report
that it took the link. Relinking is the integrator's duty at merge and the command is in
`briefs/merge-and-cleanup.md`. notes/std.md has the mechanism, the 2026-08-18 cross-contamination
that prompted it, and why `std_src` relinking loudly still does not make concurrent lanes safe.

**An unmerged branch is either abandoned or it is holding knowledge that is not on `main`, and the
second case is a bug in where the knowledge lives.** `fix/redoxfs-write-loop` survived that prune
because it carried an investigation's conclusion that `notes/fs-server.md` does not. **Nobody reads
branches.** If a branch holds a finding worth keeping, land the finding in `notes/` and then delete
the branch; do not keep the branch as the record.
