# Mechanisms, not memory: the ladder and why each rung exists

*Appendix to [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), which carries the ladder itself as a rule. This file
carries the evening that produced it, the worked examples on each rung, and the three failures that
showed what rung zero costs. Moved here 2026-09-23 (UTC) on calef's authorization, unchanged in
substance.*

calef, 2026-08-04, after an evening in which three separate duties turned out to belong to whoever
happened to notice, and none of them noticed. **This is the tenet the roles in `AGENTS.md` exist to
serve**, so read it first: it explains why there is a steward and a merge drain at all, rather than
a list of things a careful maintainer would simply do.

**Design for coordinating many, not for one attentive person.** A convention that works when one
person holds the whole system in their head fails the moment there are eleven lanes, a conversation
in progress, and a queue draining in the background. That is this project's normal condition, not
its worst case.

**The ladder, strongest first.** When something must not go wrong, reach for the highest rung that
fits:

1. **Make the wrong state unrepresentable.** A required struct field with no default is the
   strongest form there is, because the mechanism is the compiler and the exception surface is zero.
   Milestone 50 (pipes and redirection: one sink protocol) turned `InputSpec::Required` from a unit
   variant into one carrying `writes_while_reading`, and that single choice means a program which
   writes while it reads **cannot be declared without saying so**. A pull request comment had been
   written to remind the integrator of the same thing; the type made the reminder redundant.
2. **A gate that fails loudly**, in `script/lint` or CI. Weaker, because somebody has to write it
   and it can be wrong about the tree (§77 (the branch-prefix list now describes the tree) is a live
   example: the branch-prefix check rejects the repository's second-commonest prefix). But it fires
   without being remembered.
3. **A written record at the thing itself**, which is the shape of milestone 115 (the names that
   were ratified, and the ones that were refused): provenance beside the name, not in a registry. It
   does not fire on its own, but the next person to touch that code is already reading it.
4. **A note, a report, or a comment on a pull request.** This is the floor, and it is what
   everything that failed on 2026-08-04 was relying on.

**"Somebody will notice" is not a mechanism.** It is rung zero and it belongs on no list.

**An exception is allowed and must say so.** Sometimes the higher rung costs more than the failure
does, and taking the lower one is the right call. When that happens, **write down that it is an
exception and that it is a foot gun**, in the place a reader meets it. An unmarked exception reads
as a design, and the next person extends it.

**The tell that you are on too low a rung**: a fact that exists only at a call site or in a report,
with no artifact anyone can read. That shape recurred three times in one day, each wearing different
clothes: roadmap status that was wrong in both records and invisible to the gate comparing them
(§76 (what catches a milestone status wrong in both places)), naming decisions that lived in one table
cell nobody could find (milestone 115), and a merge-order coupling that only a lane's report
mentioned. When you notice it, move up a rung.

## We are all owners: see a problem, drive it to an owner, and if none, own it

calef, 2026-09-23: *"We are all owners here so let's make certain we don't let things fall through
the cracks if we see a problem drive it to the appropriate owner first and if there isn't one then
own it."*

The complement to **"Nobody remembers, so build the mechanism that does not need them to"**: that
tenet says do not rely on anyone noticing; this one says that once you have, the problem is yours to
route, not to leave for whoever's pull request it lands on. A load-sensitive flake was written into
`notes/load-sensitive-assertions.md` twice and left both times, because "every individual encounter
looked like someone else's problem." Noticing is not owning until the problem has an owner.

**And owning is not recording.** calef, 2026-09-23, after a defect was reported, not fixed: *"Rather
than raise it as a concern, wouldn't it make sense to address it? That's Bias for Action."* The test
is *move fast on what can be undone*'s, applied to the fix: cheap and reversible, fix it now and the
record is a byproduct; on that tenet's irreversible list, write it up and stop. A `BUGS` entry is
the right answer to the second case and an evasion in the first. Acting on what you half understand
is worse than reporting it, so **a refusal carrying its reason is an action**: milestone 323 (the
falsification record is incomplete in five ways) refused two gaps for want of hardware.
