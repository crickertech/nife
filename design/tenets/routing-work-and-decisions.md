# Routing identified work, and routing a decision to an architect

*Appendix to [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), which carries the rules: a finding leaves the lane as a
proposed milestone or as a `BUGS` entry, an open decision lives in `design/decisions/`, and work
held for an architect carries the `needs-architect` label and a `## What I need from you` comment.
This file carries why each of those exists and what failed without it. The watcher machinery is in
[`notes/merge-queue.md`](../../notes/merge-queue.md) and the sweep that found the category is in
[`notes/untracked-work-sweep.md`](../../notes/untracked-work-sweep.md). Moved here 2026-09-23 (UTC)
on calef's authorization, unchanged in substance.*

**Identified work leaves the lane in a tracked form, or the merge waits.** A lane that finds work it
is not doing may report it in exactly two shapes, and "worth doing someday" is neither. Either a
**proposed milestone** (provisional, the integrator mints the number at merge like every other
global name), or a **recorded limitation written where a reader meets the feature**, in the `BUGS`
section beside it, which is what the promotion triggers of §71 (a limitation is promoted when it
becomes a plan) are then measured against. A finding with no home is the integrator's cue to hold
the merge until it has one.

This is rung three of the ladder, and it is worth naming why the lower rungs fail here specifically.
A lane report is read once, by one person, on the day it is written. A pull request body is read
while the diff is open and never again. Both feel like records while you are writing them, which is
what makes this the failure that recurs: milestone 90 (a guard page under the per-CPU secondary
stacks) exists only because calef happened to be at his desk the day a report named it, and
milestone 94 (the untracked-work sweep) swept the tree for exactly this category and then left its
own inventory in a pull request body for twelve days, by which point the item-level list was gone
and had to be re-derived. See notes/untracked-work-sweep.md.

**The merge checklist grows one line**: every piece of identified work in the lane's report has a
home. `briefs/merge-and-cleanup.md` has that checklist whole, with the prune and the relink.

Two things this deliberately does not do. **It does not gate**: no check can tell an intention from
an observation in prose, and a lint that tried would be `git grep -w TODO`'s 82% false-positive rate
wearing a different hat. And **it does not touch the `BUGS` convention**, which is the FreeBSD
posture working as designed; the whole point is to route intentions *into* it rather than out of it.

**Open decisions live in a file, not in a conversation.** A decision waiting on an architect that
exists only in chat scrollback is in exactly the medium milestone 94 was written to abolish, and on
2026-08-04 five of them accumulated there in one day while that milestone was being built. They go
in `design/decisions/` marked [`status: PROPOSED`](../decisions/README.md), one file each: what is
being decided, the options, the recommendation with its reason, and what it blocks. (They lived
briefly in `design/open-decisions.md`; milestone 114 (split `DECISIONS.md`, and give a decision a
status) absorbed that file, and the numbering is the integrator's at merge like every other section
number.)

**And work waiting on an architect carries its own label and its own ask** (calef, 2026-08-04). The
same principle one level out: a pull request held for him is a decision, and a queue that exists
only in a chat message is the medium above. Two things, both at the moment the decision to hold is
made and not later, because the failure this prevents is the maintainer forgetting it is holding
something:

- **The `needs-architect` label**, so the queue is `gh pr list --label needs-architect` rather than
  a paragraph somebody has to have read. **It names the role, not the person** (calef, 2026-08-05):
  he holds it today and would like a second architect tomorrow, and a mechanism that spells one name
  has that name as its failure mode. Its description carries the reason a thing lands there at all:
  outside standing merge authority, meaning the syscall surface, a new dependency, or a `DECISIONS`
  section owed.
- **A `## What I need from you` comment** naming the specific ask. Three properties make it worth
  writing, and they are what separate it from a link to a diff. It should be **answerable without
  reading the diff**, because the point is to spend an architect's attention on the decision rather
  than on reconstructing it. It should **say what happens if he says no**, since a recommendation
  with no stated downside is not a recommendation. And it should **separate what is blocking from
  what is eventually his**, so a naming backlog does not get tangled with a merge decision; the gate
  of milestone 115 (the names that were ratified, and the ones that were refused) takes `unrecorded`
  as a truthful answer precisely so that provisional names never block.

**The watchers run unattended as `nife-smelter[bot]` in scheduled Actions workflows** (calef,
2026-09-23; the watch that reads a machine's own lane worktrees stays per developer), and a session
confirms they are alive *and reads what they already found*, because `merge-drain.sh` posts once per
stall and then goes quiet by design (calef, 2026-08-26). `briefs/session-start.md` is that check,
deferring the queue read to `briefs/survey-the-queue.md`. A queue reports, it does not resolve.

They exist because on 2026-08-04 three duties turned out to belong to whoever happened to notice:
two green pull requests sat unmerged for hours, `main` went red with nobody assigned, and merging
one pull request staled eight others that nothing picked back up. The steward was meant to cover
this and did not, for a reason worth keeping: **it reported and never acted.** A stalled queue
announced in a message is only useful if somebody reads the message. notes/merge-queue.md has the
workflows, the plist that remains and the commands retiring the two it replaces, the token premise
tested first, what the schedule costs, and a BUGS section honest that no watcher reports its own
death.

**Do not try to route this by requesting a review.** GitHub silently refuses a review request from
the pull request's own author: `gh pr edit N --add-reviewer calef` **returns success and sets zero
reviewers**, because every pull request here is authored under calef's account by the `gh` token.
That was tried on 2026-08-04 and the silent no-op looked exactly like a working queue, which is
worse than an error. Assignees and labels do work; reviewers do not.

**Stop and bring it to an architect only when it is genuinely an architect's call:** a design fork
not already decided, a test that will not pass after real effort, a hardware or external dependency,
or the machine contradicting the plan. Otherwise proceed and report what you did.
