# The rules that hold the codebase together, and what each one buys

*Appendix to [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), which carries the seven rules themselves. This file
carries the reason behind each: the Raspberry Pi port that becomes a directory rather than a diff,
the driver that knows only a base address, what §46 means by write it or vendor it, and why a
`#[path]` module shared by two binaries is checked by nothing. Moved here 2026-09-23 (UTC) on calef's
authorization, unchanged in substance.*


These come from `design/decisions/`. They are cheap to follow and expensive to retrofit.

1. **All architecture-specific code lives under `kernel/src/arch/`.** Assembly, `asm!`,
   system registers, CPU-specific behaviour. If you're writing `asm!` outside `arch/`, that
   is the bug. This is what makes the Raspberry Pi port a new directory instead of a diff
   across every file.

2. **A driver never reaches into a kernel global.** It gets what it needs passed in (a base
   address, later a DMA allocator, later an interrupt registration). See
   `drivers/pl011.rs`: it takes a base address and knows nothing else.

3. **The syscall surface stays narrow and explicit.** It is a boundary, not a habit.

5. **Architectural parity is a gate, not an aspiration** (DECISIONS §19). The targets are
   aarch64, riscv64, and x86_64 (declared, not yet started). A kernel capability ships on every
   supported architecture, proven by the same suite, or a scope note records the gap and the
   plan. If a feature works on one ISA and silently not another, that is the bug.

Rules 2, 3 and 7 are what keep the microkernel option open (7 because a contract you cannot
test is a contract you cannot trust to replace a component behind). We are deliberately **not**
speculatively trait-ifying every subsystem, because that builds the wrong abstraction before
the requirements are known.

4. **Assume weak memory ordering.** We're on ARM, which is the weak one, and that's a gift:
   we cannot develop hidden strong-ordering assumptions the way an x86-first project would.
   Don't squander it.

6. **Taking a dependency is a decision, not a convenience** (DECISIONS §46). The tree's shape is
   thin architectural primitives (`aarch64-cpu`, `spin`, `tock-registers`) or whole subsystems we
   would never write (`smoltcp`, vendored RedoxFS), with **nothing in between**: thirty crates have
   no external dependencies at all. Write it if it is on the verification path, because you cannot
   restructure someone else's crate to make a model checker tractable. Vendor it if correctness is
   won by *exposure* rather than by reading the spec, which is why §46 says write the calendar and
   vendor the crypto.

7. **Anything two binaries must agree on is a crate, never a `#[path]` module** (calef, 2026-08-01).
   If a constant, an opcode, a layout, or an error code is shared by more than one program, it goes
   in `crates/` and is depended on. `#[path = "x.rs"] mod x;` is not an option.

   **Two reasons**, and `script/lint` check 5 carries the third: it counts consumers
   per `#[path]` target and fails at two.

   It removes a category that nothing enforces. A `#[path]` module is neither a program nor a crate,
   so a reader meeting `cseam::GRANT_VA` cannot tell what they are looking at, and `user/src/` held
   48 programs and 3 modules with nothing distinguishing them.

      And it makes location self-enforcing for free. Once shared definitions live in `crates/`,
   everything in `user/src/` is a program, with **no files moved** and no convention to remember.

   This was already the tree's practice for seven crates (`fs_proto`, `sink_proto`, `cred_proto`,
   `clock_proto`, `entropy_proto`, `ntp_proto`, `gfx_proto`) and the exceptions had no recorded
   reason; `cseam.rs`'s header describes the `#[path]` mechanism without ever justifying it.
