# Appendix to risk 6: A capability-confined userspace driver cannot drive real hardware at real speed

*An appendix to [`design/fatal-risks.md`](../fatal-risks.md)'s risk 6. **That entry is the claim of
record**, and it is written so that a reader can decide what to work on next without opening this
file. This one exists to be verified or challenged: it holds the evidence, the dates, the numbers,
the corrections and the refusals behind the verdict, at the length they need rather than the length
the six-pager has. Where a study has its own home in `notes/` this page links it rather than copying
it. **Name provisional** (`design/fatal-risks/` and this file's stem), minted 2026-09-23 by the lane
that split the file; naming is calef's.*

**The claim:** the thing that makes the thesis interesting, drivers outside the kernel behind an
IOMMU, does not survive contact with a real device.

**Evidence today:** milestone 16 (real hardware and IOMMU-backed driver isolation)'s 16b proved
IOMMU-backed DMA isolation against QEMU's emulation of the
ratified RISC-V IOMMU, over the PCIe transport of §18 (one driver, two buses, the seam in the
kernel), and milestone 35 (prove the DMA-confinement boundary) built the DMA validator. All of it is
virtio or emulated. The VisionFive 2 boots and its ratified-IOMMU silicon does not exist (milestone
143).

**Verdict of record (see the main entry for the Experiment status field): RUN, and as of 2026-09-16 all three of its parts are measured on
silicon.** The two
2026-09-04 halves are below; the third was taken on 2026-09-16 and is the bullet that used to read
*unmeasured*. **This does not retire the risk**, and the reason is in the third bullet and repeated
at the foot of this entry: a TRNG is the smallest real device on the board, and throughput is what a
TRNG cannot test.

The risk names three things and they were never one claim. Measured on radon, transcripts at
`target/board/radon-2026-09-04-trng-success.log` and `bench/radon-2026-09-16/tour-083200.log`:

- **Confined: yes**, 2026-09-03. Milestone 159 (a real hardware entropy source: the JH7110's
  TRNG)'s driver is an EL0 process started from the archive, reaching the JH7110's TRNG through a
  capability that names no device. This is the tree's only confined driver for a real, non-virtio
  device.
- **Drives real hardware: yes**, 2026-09-04, reproducibly. `served 32+32 bytes`, two boots, first
  draws `3faa07e1` and `731191ba`, each boot's two draws differing from each other. Reseeded per
  boot rather than a constant in silicon or a stale register file.
- **At real speed: MEASURED on silicon, 2026-09-16.** **955,223 bytes/s**, 64 bytes in 67 us over
  eight `entropy_protocol` round trips, which is about **8.4 us per round trip**; bring-up 562 us.
  One boot of radon, transcript at `bench/radon-2026-09-16/tour-083200.log`. The instrument is the
  one built on 2026-09-10 (the tour reads the timebase around the step and the `hw entropy` line
  carries three figures), and this is the boot that proposal was waiting for.

  **The QEMU denominator did not survive contact with the board, and that is the finding.** It was
  built to say that the path itself costs about 250 us per 8-byte exchange with an emulated device
  that costs nothing, so that whatever radon spent beyond that would be the JH7110's. radon spends
  **8.4 us**, which is thirty times *less* than the floor it was supposed to be read against, and
  the bring-up is 562 us against QEMU's 8069 to 13057 us. So TCG was slower than silicon in both
  halves and the subtraction the denominator was for cannot be done. The proposal had already said
  to distrust the QEMU bring-up figure; the rate figure turns out to want the same warning.

  **What the number counts** is what the tour's own line says: the round trips, the context switches
  each one costs, the driver's poll loop, and the device. It does not count the spawn or the
  bring-up, and **it is not comparable to a Linux `hwrng` throughput figure**, which is a read from
  an already-running in-kernel driver with no IPC in it. The honest comparison, against
  `jh7110-trng.c` on the same silicon, is interrupt-driven where this driver polls and remains
  unmeasured.

**What it took is worth recording, because none of it was the driver.** Milestone 239 (radon's
device tree does not describe the TRNG) found the device tree spells the node with the vendor
U-Boot's `starfive,trng` rather than mainline's `starfive,jh7110-trng`. Milestone 220 (this kernel
drives no clock or reset controller) found the block's clocks gated and its reset asserted, and this
kernel had never programmed either. And milestone 159's own boot tour asked for 32 bytes down a
channel that carries 8, so its success line had been **unreachable on any device, working or dead,
since the day it was written** and survived because QEMU has no TRNG node to take the other arm.

**The remaining part is the one the risk is named for.** A driver that serves entropy slowly still
refutes nothing; the claim is about cost, and cost is what has not been measured.

**The decisive experiment:** one real, non-virtio device on real silicon, confined, at throughput.
The JH7110's GMAC from milestone 53 (the board's own peripherals: network and storage on real
silicon), or NVMe behind milestone 163 (the JH7110's PCIe root complex), are the candidates.

**Journey 3 settles most of this as a side effect**, because a framebuffer and a keyboard on real
hardware are real devices.

**Two corrections, 2026-09-03, from the §86 research lane.** The evidence line above says "All of it
is virtio or emulated", and the first half went stale on 2026-08-15: milestone 53 built a real,
non-virtio NVMe driver, confined by the IOMMU on all three architectures. Still emulated, so the
sentence's conclusion holds; its reason does not.

The second correction is the one that matters. **No IOMMU data point can settle this risk while the
NVMe driver is kernel-resident**, because the driver whose confinement the risk is about would be
the kernel. That is what DECISIONS §86 (whether an NVMe driver can leave the kernel, and what
capability would let it) decides, which puts §86 on this risk's critical path rather than beside it.
And the board this risk's experiment names has no IOMMU: milestone 143 (silicon IOMMU) exists
because no board shipping the ratified RISC-V IOMMU spec exists today. So a real-silicon NVMe
experiment on radon confines nothing unless something in software does, which §86's research pass
found is possible and had been ruled out on a false premise.

**The third correction, 2026-09-04, and it is a result rather than a correction.** On radon, a
userspace program holding two rendezvous capabilities and **one page of device memory** (no IRQ
capability, no DMA page, no `Virtio` capability) brought up the JH7110's TRNG and served a client
bytes that were not zero and that changed between draws, through a capability that names no device.

That splits this risk into three, and two of them are now answered:

- **Confined**: yes, demonstrated on silicon.
- **Drive real hardware**: yes, demonstrated on silicon. A TRNG is a small device, and that is worth
  saying plainly rather than glossing: it has no DMA, no interrupt in this driver's path, and one
  register window. It is the *smallest* real device on the board, so it settles "a confined
  userspace process can reach non-virtio silicon at all" and it settles nothing about a device with
  a ring buffer.
- **At real speed**: **measured on silicon 2026-09-16, and the small-device question is closed.**
  955,223 bytes/s, 8.4 us per round trip, bring-up 562 us. The full figures and what they do and do
  not count are at the head of this entry. **Corrected 2026-09-11:** this used to read "nothing in
  the boot tour timestamps the step, so the only available clock is a person watching a serial
  console", and that stopped being true on 2026-09-10 when the step began timing itself; the boot
  that read it came five days after that.

The decisive experiment above is unchanged, because throughput is what a TRNG cannot test.

**And the machine for it exists, which nobody had established until 2026-09-05.** The decisive
experiment is one real non-virtio device on real silicon, confined, at throughput.
[§86](../decisions/86-el0-nvme-driver.md) was decided on 2026-09-03 and its own research recorded that
**no board this project owns has an IOMMU in front of a real NVMe controller**. xenon has both, and
its firmware transcription says so precisely: a `Micron 2450 NVMe 256GB` on M.2 PCIe SSD-0 with SATA
in AHCI rather than RAID, *"so the NVMe is a plain PCIe function rather than hidden behind Intel
RST"*, on a machine milestone 87 (the x86_64 bare-metal machine) selected partly for VT-d.

**And that machine now boots nife, as of 2026-09-17** (milestone 87, `BUILT`), which removes the
last thing standing between this risk and its decisive experiment that was not code. Its first
complete boot reported `iommu : VT-d drhd at 0x00000000fed90000, root table default-deny,
translating` and `pci : 15 function(s) on the bus`, so the IOMMU this experiment needs came up on
its own hardware rather than under emulation.

**What stood in the way was not hardware, it was that the disk held somebody else's Windows**, and a
disk this project must not write to is not a disk it can drive. calef confirmed on 2026-09-05 that
the installation is a freshly wiped image from the seller rather than anyone's data, and that the
machine's own firmware can clear it (Maintenance, Data Wipe, `Wipe on Next Boot`, which covers M.2
PCIe SSD; `notes/xenon-firmware.md`, IMG_4091).

calef ran that wipe on 2026-09-17, so the disk is this project's to write to.

**The driver exists too, as of 2026-09-17**: milestone 261 (the NVMe driver leaves the kernel, on
the machine that can finally confine it), §86's option 2a. An EL0 process holding two endpoints, one
page of BAR0 and a run of DMA pages brings a controller from reset through identify to an I/O queue
pair and serves the block verbs, with the IOMMU the whole of what stops it reaching memory it was
not given, and `kernel/src/user/non_volatile_memory_express_tests.rs` asserts that confinement on
every leg the runner attaches a controller to. Milestone 318 (the NVMe boot test on real geometry)
then rewrote its assertions against the geometry each boot is handed, which is what lets the same
case run on xenon's Micron rather than only on `mknvmedisk`'s 8 MiB image.

**So the remaining distance to this risk's decisive experiment is a bench evening, and nothing
else.** Every piece is on `main` and the stick is written. Two things still have to be true on the
night, and neither is code: the DMAR's device scope must cover the NVMe function, because a
throughput number from an unconfined device answers a different question; and the controller's LBA
size must give `blocks_per` in `1..=8`, or the server never starts and the line reads `skipped`
rather than `ok`. **A skip is not a pass.**
