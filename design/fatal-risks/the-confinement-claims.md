# Appendix to risk 7: The confinement claim is false

*An appendix to [`design/fatal-risks.md`](../fatal-risks.md)'s risk 7. **That entry is the claim of
record**, and it is written so that a reader can decide what to work on next without opening this
file. This one exists to be verified or challenged: it holds the evidence, the dates, the numbers,
the corrections and the refusals behind the verdict, at the length they need rather than the length
the six-pager has. Where a study has its own home in `notes/` this page links it rather than copying
it. **Name provisional** (`design/fatal-risks/` and this file's stem), minted 2026-09-23 by the lane
that split the file; naming is calef's.*

**The claim:** a confined component escapes, and the property the whole system is built to provide
does not hold.

**Evidence today:** DECISIONS §31 (the foreign-language seam) proves a C component faulting on a
deliberate out-of-bounds write, restarted by its supervisor, with two witness pages answering two
different questions. `notes/untrusted-input-audit.md` surveys the attack surface, and there are fuzz
targets.

**What is missing:** every one of those is a test written by the same people who wrote the thing
being tested.

**Verdict of record (see the main entry for the Experiment status field): RUN, 2026-08-31, and it found the thing this risk exists to find.**
notes/confinement-claims.md; PR #614.

- **26 claims enumerated**, each with where it is stated, which test checks it, and whether that test
  has been shown to fail when the claim is broken. **Three were stated nowhere**, including one the
  system deliberately does *not* make: a confined device's **values** are not confined, only its
  reach. The IOMMU and the DMA validator constrain placement, never content.
- **25 harnesses now carry a replayable falsification**, up from 6. The sweep is 25 swept, 0
  survivors, and every patch names the assertion it expects to fail.
- **DECISIONS §31's headline assertion never runs.** Mapping `WITNESS_RO` read/write does turn the C
  seam test red, but `assert_eq!(v[2], CONFINED)`, the line that prints *"read-only witness intact"*,
  is not what catches it: **a component that is not confined does not fault, no fault means no death
  report, and the witness check is reachable only by an escape that faults anyway.** The sentence the
  seam is quoted for is not the sentence doing the work.
- **And the first attempt failed for the wrong reason**, which is the hazard this milestone's own
  block warned about, on the day it was written: the break surfaced as a 234-second watchdog timeout
  reading *"a livelock, not a lost wakeup"*, a correct red with nothing in it about confinement.

**The adversarial pass: AUDITED, 2026-09-17, and the answer is a qualified yes with one
exception found and fixed.** This paragraph was a second `**Status:` line until 2026-09-23, and
`script/fatal-risks` read only the first one per entry, so `AUDITED` was invisible to every tool
reading this file. The Experiment status above is the entry's one status; how well the experiment
was done belongs here, in prose, where it always was.

Milestone 313 (the security audit that was due since August: userspace confinement, read
adversarially) read this risk's question adversarially under the userspace-confinement lens, the
first security audit since 2026-08-17. `design/audit-reports/2026-09-17-userspace-confinement.md`
has it; findings fixed 3, minted 3, accepted 1.

**One published claim was false as stated, on a path taken every boot.** DECISIONS §12 (Call/Reply
IPC: a one-shot reply capability) says *a consumed capability cannot be used again*. On `x86_64` it
was not: `SYS_CAP_DELETE` cleared the capability table and **not** the cached grant the context
switch installs into the TSS I/O bitmap, so a thread that dropped its `PortRange` kept COM1 for the
rest of its life. `system_initializer` performs exactly that delete on every x86 boot. Fixed in
`sched::delete_current_cap`, with a test and a falsification replayed red.

**A second published sentence about the hardware was false and is now true.** `crates/paging`'s
decoder reports user pages as not kernel-executable, and milestone 307 (which assertion actually
fires when a confinement claim is broken) wrote that the hardware makes it so; on x86 that holds
only with `CR4.SMEP`, which nothing set. The bit is now set per core where CPUID offers it, and
307's sentence is struck through with the correction beside it rather than edited away.

**The headline claim was not found false anywhere this audit looked**, and what it looked at is
stated rather than implied: components that took device or network authority since the last audit,
which reading every capability mint site shrank from 45 counted components to **two objects**; the
six claims milestone 307 marked quotable-but-unreachable, none of which turned out weaker than its
claim; and the two new machine classes, radon and xenon.

**Three things this does not settle.** The syscall surface and IPC model are the remaining untaken
lens and want their own audit. The adversarial half this entry has always called for, an outsider
trying to escape rather than us demonstrating a planned escape fails, is now **partly built** and
still gated behind milestone 198 (the trivial install that makes a second customer possible). An adversarial pass on 2026-09-21 asked where authority lives
outside a cspace and **found a claim false**: every revocation sweep walked a thread's capability
table and stopped, so a capability parked in `Thread::outgoing_cap` (the hand-off slot a `SEND_CAP`
writes when no receiver waits) survived the sweep and was delivered afterwards. `MemoryRegion::DESTROY`
sweeps capabilities precisely so that no capability still names a page the allocator is about to hand
out, and an in-flight one reopened that. Fixed in the three sweeps that lacked it, with a test red
first on all three architectures; `notes/confinement-claims.md` carries it and the eight attacks that
held. **The caveat is the one that keeps the gate closed**: it was us attacking our own system, which
is the thing milestone 198 exists to stop being the only kind of attack this project has seen. And
one window was accepted rather than closed at the time: `PortRange::REVOKE` reached one core, so a
revoked holder on another core kept its bitmap for at most one tick. That window is recorded in
§152 (the port-range capability)'s `BUGS`, corrected the same day, and in
[milestone 315](../roadmap/315-port-revoke-every-core.md), which the audit raised as finding 4 and
calef promoted out of this entry's proposal on 2026-09-17.

**Corrected 2026-09-23: that window is closed.** Milestone 315 (a port revoke that reaches every
core) is BUILT. The revoke now resets this core and rides the TLB shootdown's NMI to the rest, and
`install_port_grant` moved inside the locked region so no core can reinstall a grant the sweep just
cleared. Proved by 12 of 12 full two-core suites, 36 boots, against 3 of 12 failing before.

**What it does to this risk, which is less than it sounds.** It removes an accepted hole from the
confinement claim, so the claim is stronger than the audit left it. It does not change the caveat
above, which is the one that matters: the attacking was still us attacking our own system. A window
we closed ourselves, found by our own test, is the same category of evidence as the audit that found
it, and this entry's verdict rests on that category rather than on any single hole.

**And the audit produced a third instance of this file's recurring shape.** Milestone 299 (the
serial console becomes a userspace driver)'s two port tests could not fail in the direction they
exist for: a wrongly permitted `out` was followed by a `SEND` nobody received, so the run hung
instead of going red. That is row 26's shape one object over, found only because a draft of finding
1 hung. After milestone 305's vacuous `U`-bit test and milestone 307's six unreachable assertions,
**three independent sweeps have now each found confinement tests that could not fail**, which is the
strongest evidence in this file that the question risk 3 asks is answered differently inside the
kernel than outside it.

**What it does not say.** Nothing here says the confinement holds. What it supports is narrower and
was the point: these named claims are tested, and each has been shown to fail when the claim is
broken. The adversarial exercise this entry originally called for is still unbuilt: an outsider
trying to escape, rather than us demonstrating that a planned escape fails. That wants outside eyes
and is gated behind milestone 198 by calef's no-third-parties position.

**The six kernel rows got their mechanism on 2026-09-16, and one of them was not testing its own
claim.** This entry said until that day that those rows had none; milestone 305 (the six kernel
confinement rows get a falsification a machine can replay) built it, on top of milestone 210 (no
kernel test can be run by name)'s `cargo xtask test --test <substring>` (built 2026-08-31, and the
note claiming the mechanism "does not exist" had been stale for sixteen days). Seven of the eight
tests behind rows 21 to 26 now carry a replayable falsification. The sweep is **48 swept, 0
survivors, 2 min 55 s warm**.

**The finding is the one this risk exists to produce, and it is worse than a missing test.**
`the_page_tables_say_u_mode_cannot_read_the_kernels_memory` was patched to remove the `U`-bit check
from `mmu::user_can_read` **outright**, and the test still passed. `user_can_read` went through
`translate_user`, whose `Mapper` is built with `Half::Low` *always*, so a high-half kernel address
returned `None` before any leaf was read. **The assertion answered "U-mode cannot read the kernel"
by refusing to look**, and had done so since milestone 41 (dead code: triage the suppressions, and
un-blindfold the gate), with every gate in this tree green throughout. `is_mapped_in_current_space`
exists forty lines away for exactly this case and says so in its own doc comment. Fixed in 305
(`translate_in_either_half`) and measured both ways.

That is the shape of failure this file's rule 1 is about: **a test that cannot come back red is
indistinguishable from a test that passes**, and nothing but a falsification can tell them apart.
Risk 3's mutation census measures the same property over host crates and cannot see kernel tests at
all, so this class was invisible to every instrument the project owned.

**Two further things were recorded rather than smoothed over.** Row 26 (a client of a rendezvous
cannot become its server) is **`unfalsified`**, honestly: the complete break produces a 60-second
lost-wakeup watchdog rather than a claim-shaped red, because `RECV_CAP` blocks, so an attacker the
kernel fails to refuse takes the honest server's message instead of reporting an escape. Filling it
with an easier defect would have fired an assertion while leaving the claim untested, which is
precisely what the row above shows costs eight months. And **§31's assertion-order hazard has a
second independent instance**: row 24's quotable crossing assertion sits below two per-shell bitmap
equalities that catch any crossing one call earlier, so it cannot run. Two instances found the same
way in one sweep is a reason to expect more.
