//! The same linker contract as `std_exerciser`: the shared `crates/user_mode_runtime/link.ld`, as is.
//!
//! **This used to relink at 16 MiB**, by substituting the shared script's base, because every program
//! was linked at `0x40_0000` with its stack at `0x50_0000` and a `rustls` provider with its RustCrypto
//! primitives did not fit in the 896 KiB between them. Milestone 206 (a program image has under 896 KiB) drew the address-space map
//! (`crates/address_space_map`, DECISIONS §171 (where a program image starts) option D), which gives a program image 496 MiB at the
//! shared base, so the substitution and the second script it produced are gone.
