# helpers/cancelled-duplicate-selftest.sh: the drain's "rerun the cancelled duplicate, once"
# detection, checked against fixtures, and its consumer checked for still using it.
#
# Fixtures, all on one head SHA:
#   CI       #10 success 15:43:24, #11 cancelled 15:43:24 (newer, same second)   -> rerun #11
#   verify   #20 cancelled 15:43:24, #21 success 15:43:24 (cancelled is older)   -> nothing
#   bench    #30 cancelled 15:43:24, #31 success 15:44:10 (ordinary supersede)   -> nothing
#   lint     #40 success 15:43:24, #41 cancelled 15:43:24, run_attempt 2         -> nothing: rerun once
#   docs     #50 in_progress 15:43:24, #51 cancelled 15:43:24                    -> rerun #51 (sibling running)
# script/lint runs it.
