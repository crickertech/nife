# Run the whole trial matrix for milestone 521 (does an AI review of a pull request catch anything the gates and the maintainer do not):
# every model against every bundle, both postures, N times.
#
#     REVIEW_BASE_URL=... helpers/review-matrix.sh <bundle-dir> <out-dir> [replicates]
#
# **Provisional name.** Replicates exist because a single call is not a measurement: a pilot run at
# a lower token cap got a substantive review out of the same model and bundle that later answered
# "NO CONCERNS", and one of those two would have been the reported result.
#
# # BUGS
#
# - **Its output does not belong in the tree loose.** Model output carries the characters this
#   tree's style gates forbid, and calef refused an exception per corpus on 2026-09-22, so a run's
#   transcripts are archived rather than committed as files. notes/delegated-review/README.md has
#   the reason and the extract command; the directory this writes is the input to that archive.
# - **It retries a timeout twice and then gives up**, leaving that cell's file absent. Scoring must
#   treat an absent file as missing, not as a reviewer with nothing to say.
