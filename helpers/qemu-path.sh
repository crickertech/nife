# scripts/qemu-path.sh: put this project's own QEMU on PATH, if it has one.
#
# There is no shebang to infer a dialect from, because this file is sourced rather than run, so
# ShellCheck is told which one to assume. The directive takes no trailing prose (SC1125).
# shellcheck shell=sh
#
# **Sourced, never executed.** It has no shebang and no `set -e` on purpose: it modifies the PATH of
# the shell that reads it, which an executed script cannot do. Every `script/` entry point that can
# end up running an emulator reads it, one line, immediately after the `cd` to the repository root:
#
#     . scripts/qemu-path.sh
#
# **Why it exists, and it is a loop that nobody closed** (milestone 287). On Linux, `script/ci-qemu`
# builds the pinned QEMU into `$HOME/.cache/nife-qemu` because no Ubuntu release ships one with
# `riscv-iommu-pci` (see that script's header, and DECISIONS §20). Until this file, the ONLY thing in
# the whole tree that ever put that prefix on PATH was `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. So a Linux
# developer who followed `script/bootstrap`'s own instructions built the right QEMU, re-ran
# `script/setup` as told, and `script/qemu-check` found `/usr/bin`'s 8.2.2 again: same failure, same
# message, same remedy, forever. The build was never the missing piece. PATH was.
#
# **The mechanism is inheritance, not a spawn site.** The emulator is invoked by bare name from 38
# places across 16 files, in three languages, including `exec qemu-system-aarch64` at the bottom of
# each `scripts/qemu-runner-*.sh`. Patching those would be 38 copies of one fact. Exporting PATH once
# at the top of the process tree reaches every one of them, and reaches the ones nobody has written
# yet. That is also why the helpers under `scripts/` do not source this: they are spawned by an entry
# point (or by `cargo xtask`, which the entry point spawned) and have already inherited it.
#
# **The contract on the caller is only "be somewhere inside the tree".** Every script in `script/`
# does `cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."` as its first act, but `script/crate-probes` keeps a `$ROOT` and never
# cds, so a rule spelled "be at the root" would have had exactly one exception on the day it was
# written. The pin is found by walking up instead, which costs four lines and removes the exception
# rather than documenting it. `script/lint`'s "the project's QEMU is on PATH" check enforces that the
# source line is present; `BUGS` in design/roadmap/287-bootstrap-installs-a-working-qemu.md records
# what it cannot check.

# Name: provisional, minted by milestone 287's lane on 2026-09-13. Hyphenated because AGENTS.md's
# naming table hyphenates everything under `scripts/`, and a noun phrase because a namespace is a
# thing rather than an action: this is QEMU's path, not an instruction to path it. calef has not
# ruled on it.

# `QEMU_PREFIX` and the default are `script/ci-qemu`'s, spelled once there and read here; changing
# where the build lands is that script's decision and this file follows it.

    # emulator. `.qemu-version` stays the single source of truth (`script/qemu-check`,
    # `script/ci-qemu` and the CI cache key are the others); this reads that file, it does not carry
