//! The two Kani attribute macros, as pass-throughs, so `script/lint` can compile the proof
//! harnesses without Kani installed (milestone 113). Half of the shim; the other half is `kani.rs`
//! beside it, which re-exports these and supplies `any`, `assume` and `cover!`.
//!
//! **Names are provisional** (CLAUDE.md: calef names crates, programs and modules). The `kani` crate
//! next door has no choice about its name, since `#[kani::proof]` is what the harnesses write; this
//! one is internal to the shim and could be called anything.
//!
//! An attribute macro can only come from a proc-macro crate, which is the whole reason the shim is
//! two crates rather than one. Registering `kani` as a tool namespace instead
//! (`-Zcrate-attr=register_tool(kani)`) does not work: the tool name loses to the extern crate the
//! harnesses also need for `kani::any`, and rustc then reports `cannot find proof in kani`. Measured,
//! not assumed.
//!
//! Compiled by `script/lint` with a plain `rustc` invocation, not by cargo. It is deliberately not a
//! workspace package: nothing should be able to depend on it, and a dependency named `kani` in a
//! harness crate's manifest would collide with the real library that `cargo kani` injects.
