# helpers/qemu-stick.sh: boot a nife stick under one architecture's UEFI firmware, as a USB stick.
#
#   helpers/qemu-stick.sh x86_64  target/stick          # a directory laid out like the stick
#   helpers/qemu-stick.sh aarch64 stick.img             # or a raw disk image the program wrote
#   helpers/qemu-stick.sh riscv64 target/stick
#
# Name: provisional. Minted 2026-09-19 by milestone/the-program-that-makes-the-stick, in the family of
# `qemu-uefi-x86_64.sh` (which boots one architecture's ESP directory) and named for what it boots.
#
# The same stick boots on all three because UEFI fixes a removable-media file name per architecture
# (`\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI`, `BOOTAA64.EFI`, `BOOTRISCV64.EFI`) and each firmware looks only for its
# own. That is the whole of the universal stick, and this script is how it is proved: point all three
# at the same directory or image. See notes/boot-stick.md.
#
# The stick is attached through an emulated xHCI controller as USB mass storage, which is what a real
# stick is, rather than as a virtio disk. That also keeps it out of the kernel's way: nife drives
# virtio-mmio and would otherwise find the stick as a legacy virtio disk and refuse it.
#
# The firmware images are the EDK2 builds Homebrew's QEMU ships in share/qemu. Each run copies the
# variable store fresh, so one boot's NVRAM (a boot entry, a changed setting) cannot leak into the
# next and make a result depend on history. Bounded by helpers/qemu-bounded.sh, never by `alarm`.
#
# Environment: NIFE_STICK_TIMEOUT (seconds, default 90), NIFE_SMP (default 1), NIFE_MEM (default
# 256M, 2048M on x86_64 where OVMF keeps its tables high).
