# Build **unmodified `ripgrep` from crates.io** for the nife custom target (milestone 121).
#
# This is an experiment's apparatus, not part of the build. Nothing in `script/test` runs it and no
# gate needs it: `xtask initrd-aarch64` packs the resulting ELF only if it is already on disk, and
# `kernel/src/user/ripgrep_tests.rs` skips when it is not. That is deliberate, and DECISIONS §46 is
# the reason: making the gate fetch `ripgrep` and its ~40 transitive crates would put a crates.io
# dependency tree in this repository's build, which is calef's call and not a lane's.
#
# The whole point of milestone 121 is that the source is somebody else's and is untouched. There is
# no patch, no vendored copy, and no fork. What differs from a Linux build is entirely on the
# command line below: the target spec, `-Zbuild-std` against the patched `nife-dev` toolchain, and
# the three link arguments `std_exerciser/build.rs` supplies for a program built in-tree (the shared
# linker script, `-u_start`, and no build id).
#
# All three architectures, because DECISIONS §19 makes parity a gate rather than an aspiration: a
# capability ships on every supported target or a scope note records the gap and the plan. x86_64
# joined at milestone 184, which built `x86_64-unknown-nife` and its `std` farm; before that there
# was no `std` on x86_64 and therefore no `ripgrep`.
#
# Usage: helpers/build-ripgrep.sh [version]     (default 14.1.1)
#        NIFE_RIPGREP_TRIPLES="x86_64-unknown-nife" helpers/build-ripgrep.sh   (one target only)
#
# See notes/ripgrep-on-nife.md for what it does and does not do once it is running.

# The source tree is unpacked OUTSIDE this repository on purpose. `ripgrep` carries no
# `[workspace]` table, so cargo walks up and finds this repo's root manifest, then refuses to
# build a package that "believes it's in a workspace when it's not". Unpacking under `target/`
# hits that too. The alternative (a `workspace.exclude` entry) would put ripgrep in this
# repository's manifest, which is exactly the coupling this experiment is meant not to have.

# The patched std lives in the `nife-dev` toolchain, which `xtask std-src` builds and links.
# `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` rather than `+nife-dev` for the reason `xtask::std_exerciser` records: the
# cargo proxy exports `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=nightly`, which would override a `+` selector.

# `-Copt-level=s` and `-Cstrip=debuginfo` are not tuning: ripgrep's own release profile sets
# `debug = 1`, which produces a 25 MB ELF the initrd would carry into RAM. Overriding a profile from
# the command line is a build setting, not a change to the program.
# The link script is the shared one, unchanged. **This used to relink at 16 MiB**, by substituting
# `crates/user_mode_runtime/link.ld`'s base, because every program was linked at `0x40_0000` with its
# stack at `0x50_0000`, and ripgrep's 1.37 MiB of `.text` did not fit in the 896 KiB between them.
# Milestone 206 (a program image has under 896 KiB) drew the address-space map (`crates/address_space_map`, DECISIONS §171 (where a program image starts) option D),
# which gives an image 496 MiB at the shared base, so ripgrep links like every other program.
