# PROVISIONAL NAME. Minted 2026-08-04; not put to calef. See the `Name:` block below.
#
# # Why this exists
#
# The maintainer holds merge authority, and merging is the one duty it is structurally worst at:
# when it is busy it is busy, and merging happens between conversations rather than during them. On
# 2026-08-04 two green pull requests sat unmerged for hours because nobody armed auto-merge, and the
# steward, which exists precisely to compensate for the maintainer being busy, only ever *reported*
# a stalled queue and never acted on one.
#
# # What this used to do, and why almost all of it is gone (2026-08-16)
#
# This script used to decide the merge ORDER: at most one pull request in flight, in flight before
# current before oldest, and one "Update branch" click per pass. That brain took four shapes and
# three of them starved something (the history is in notes/merge-queue.md, kept because it is
# evidence about the up-to-date rule rather than about this script).
#
# **GitHub's merge queue is now enabled on this repository, and it is that brain, one rung up.** It
# serializes candidates, tests each against the tip, and rejects what fails, which is exactly what
# the ordering logic was reconstructing from outside. Three consequences, all load-bearing:
#
#   - **Ordering is not ours any more.** Enqueue everything eligible; the queue decides.
#   - **Updating a branch is neither needed nor allowed.** The queue builds the merge candidate
#     itself, and GitHub answers `update-branch` on a queued pull request with a 422.
#   - **"Arm exactly one" is now the wrong answer**, not merely a redundant one: it leaves ready work
#     idle for a cycle when enqueueing costs nothing and the queue would have ordered it.
#
# # What is left, and why it is not nothing
#
# Two duties survive, and neither is something the platform knows:
#
#   - **The admission policy.** The queue merges what is enqueued; something has to decide what gets
#     enqueued. Drafts are not asking to be merged; `needs-architect` means the work is outside
#     standing merge authority (it touches the syscall surface, adds a dependency, or owes a
#     `DECISIONS` section); and `held-for-red-trunk` means the trunk is broken and one fix is landing
#     alone. CLAUDE.md describes the first label and the `## What I need from you` comment that goes
#     with it; notes/main-is-red.md describes the second.
#   - **Saying what stalled.** A queue never resolves a conflict (two were resolved by hand on
#     2026-08-16), and a pull request whose checks fail is ejected rather than fixed. Both need a
#     person, so both are reported and neither is retried.
#
# # Where this runs (2026-09-24)
#
# **In GitHub Actions, as `nife-smelter[bot]`**, on a five-minute schedule:
# `.github/workflows/merge-drain.yml`, which carries the reasoning, the tested premise, and the
# cadence BUGS. It used to run under `launchd` on patagonia as calef's own token, which conflated
# three actors under one name and made this singleton a singleton only because one laptop was awake.
# `helpers/lane-claim-check.sh` moved with it, because this script's `pass()` calls it; it needed no
# workflow of its own. notes/merge-queue.md has the retirement commands for the `launchd` jobs.
#
# The watching form still works from any checkout and is still the way to drive the queue by hand.
#
# A proposal to move the first duty onto a required check, which would make this script smaller
# still, is in design/decisions/ (`needs-architect` as a check rather than as a script's restraint).
#
# Name: unrecorded. Provisional, minted 2026-08-04 and not yet put to calef. Named for what it does
# to the queue rather than for the mechanism, in the family of `qemu-bounded.sh`. It lives in
# `helpers/` rather than `script/` because it is a maintainer's tool and not a front door a
# contributor types; `script/` is the normalised "Scripts to Rule Them All" set (notes/scripts.md).

# **Which drain spoke.** "smelter did it" stops being an answer the moment the automation runs in
# more than one place, and as of 2026-09-24 it does: this script runs as a scheduled workflow
# (`.github/workflows/merge-drain.yml`) and still runs by hand from a checkout. A GitHub App
# installation token carries the App and not the caller, so GitHub itself cannot tell a reader which
# instance acted; the tag has to live in the content. That is rung three of AGENTS.md's ladder and
# there is nowhere higher to reach here.
#
# The workflow sets `actions:<run id>`, which is a run somebody can open. A laptop tags itself with
# its hostname. `$ME` prefixes every line this script prints and every comment it posts.
#
# The `notify()` MARKERS are deliberately not tagged: they are the dedupe key, and a key that

# operator watched, because it runs under `launchd` with `StartInterval 300` and its admission
# policy excluded exactly two things, drafts and `needs-architect`. A hold therefore survived five
# minutes at most, and the failure was invisible in the worst way: a dequeue leaves no trace of why
# an entry came back, so the operator concluded their own dequeue had failed and misdiagnosed it
# twice. The two labels mean different things (one pull request needs calef; the trunk needs
# everybody to stop) and behave identically here, which is why they are two names and one policy.

# **Dequeue anything now held that is already in the merge queue.** Admission is checked once, at

#
# **This is not hypothetical and the window is small enough to lose a race in.** On 2026-09-18 this

# The shape is AGENTS.md's ladder: the label was rung two (a gate that fires without being

# that branch the moment checks pass. That happened to #964 on 2026-09-19, merged into #963's branch
# rather than main, and its PR page read MERGED while `main` had none of it. Harmless that time,
# because it rode into main inside #963; a trap in general, because a stacked PR whose base is later
# abandoned reads as merged and is on no branch anyone lands. A stacked PR is left alone here, and
# GitHub retargets it to `main` when its base branch merges and is deleted, which is when it is armed.

# **And a head that lives in another repository is not a lane** (2026-09-24 security audit). Until

# **A report only this script's own stdout can see is not a report calef will find in time.**
#
# # Why this exists
#
# On 2026-08-26 three armed pull requests (#530, #531, #532) sat "3 armed, 0 stalled" for hours
# while the queue drained nothing, because each carried a GitHub Actions run stuck `queued` with
# no job ever started. Once that stall shape was named (`stuck_checks` below), calef asked the
# obvious next question: could the script itself tell him, instead of a log file on patagonia that
# nothing prompts anyone to open. It can: `gh pr comment` is one API call, same shape as
# `gh pr merge --auto`.
#
# **The one real risk is spam, not correctness.** A stall that persists gets re-detected every
# five-minute pass, and posting a fresh comment every pass would bury the one useful comment under
# duplicates within the hour. So `notify` checks the pull request's own comments for a marker
# (an HTML comment, invisible when rendered) before posting, and posts once per marker per pull
# request, ever, not once per stall *episode*. A stall that clears and recurs later does not get a
# second comment. That is a real, accepted limitation rather than a solved problem: closing it needs
# either a timestamp-based cooldown or deleting the marker comment when a stall clears, and neither
# was worth building for a first cut. The five-minute log line still fires every pass regardless;
# only the PR comment is deduplicated.

# A draft that has stopped moving is probably a finished lane that forgot to mark it ready.
#
# # Why this exists
#
# On 2026-08-19 PR #348's lane finished, reported, and left its pull request a draft. The drain
# excludes drafts **by design** ("a draft is not asking to be merged"), so it sat unmergeable for
# hours while every observer saw exactly what a healthy working lane looks like. It was found by
# calef asking why two pull requests were drafts, not by anything in this system.
#
# **That is the recurring shape rather than a one-off**: a state whose silence is indistinguishable
# from healthy operation. The same day, a watcher died and nothing said so while `main` was red, and
# a CI gate went red on a check that could not block a merge. In all three the observer was missing,
# not the signal.
#
# **Rung four is "tell lanes to mark ready", and that is what failed.** The mechanism has to be
# something that notices, so this reports a draft whose branch has stopped receiving commits. A live
# lane commits as it works, per AGENTS.md ("commit whenever a piece works and push whenever a commit
# exists"); a finished one goes quiet. Quiet for longer than a full gate takes is the signal.
#
# It **reports and does not act**. Marking somebody else's draft ready would be a judgement about
# whether their work is done, which is exactly the thing the draft is claiming. This says the words a
# person needs and leaves the decision.
#
# The threshold is generous on purpose. `script/test` runs both ISAs and a slow leg is tens of
# minutes, so anything tighter would fire on lanes that are working and teach everyone to ignore it.

# `Blocked-by: #N` in a pull request body: a SELF-RELEASING hold for a mechanical ordering
# constraint, as opposed to `needs-architect`, which means a person must decide something.
#
# # Why this exists, and why a plain "held" label was refused
#
# On 2026-08-18 #329 and #324 each carried a file named `97-*.md` in `design/decisions/`. Both were
# green alone; a merge-queue group containing both fails the decisions gate, because two sections
# cannot share a number. #329 was evicted as UNMERGEABLE while reporting CLEAN on its own page, and
# the only lever available to keep the drain from re-arming it was `needs-architect`, which says a
# person must rule on something. Using it here would have put a false entry on calef's queue, which
# is the one queue in this project that must not accumulate noise.
#
# That is the same shape as #274, which was enqueued and evicted **29 times, 26 of them in a
# 3.5-hour loop**: #271 landed a doctest calling a method whose arity #274 was changing, git merged
# both without a conflict marker, and the pair was red only together. Green alone, green alone, red
# together is not a state any per-branch check can see.
#
# **A generic hold label was considered and refused**, and the reason is the failure mode rather
# than tidiness: a manual label has to be REMOVED by whoever remembers, and this project has a
# recorded history of exactly that going wrong. `needs-architect` was left on #320 and on #329 after
# both had been answered, on the same day, and calef found both. A hold that outlives its reason is
# a false blocker, and a false blocker is worse than none because it is believed.
#
# So the hold names its own release condition and evaporates without anybody acting: when #N merges,
# the next pass arms this pull request. Nothing to remember, and `gh pr list` shows the reason.
#
# The blocker being CLOSED rather than merged is reported loudly instead of silently released,
# because that is an anomaly: it means the thing this was sequenced behind is not coming.

# `10 armed, 7 stalled, of 17 unheld` is the state of the queue at the end of one pass, so summing
# it across passes double counts every pull request that was still armed on the next pass. With
# 3,355 passes on record in `~/Library/Logs/nife/merge-drain.log`, the question calef asked on
# 2026-09-23 -- how often does the drain act, as against him prompting a maintainer -- could not be
# answered from any of them. The `STALLED.` lines have the same defect: a stall that persists is
# re-detected and re-printed every pass, which is exactly why `notify` deduplicates the pull
# request comment and the log line does not.
#
# **This tree has made the same mistake once before and the correction is already written down**,
# so it is cited rather than re-argued: `script/metrics`' `built_by_week` and the "The only flow on
# this page" section of notes/project-metrics.md. A stock read late is merely stale; a flow read
# late lands in the wrong bucket.

# So two event lines are added, and both are named in capitals in the family of `STALLED.` so the
# log stays greppable by one pattern per kind:
#
#     merge-drain: ARMED #N ...        this pass put #N into the queue, or armed it to enter
#     merge-drain: DEQUEUED #N ...     this pass took #N back out
#     merge-drain: ENQUEUED #N ...     this pass put an armed, green #N into the queue itself,
#                                      because the platform had not (2026-09-24, see stranded_numbers)
#     merge-drain: RERAN #N run <id> .. this pass reran the CI run a concurrency group cancelled as a
#                                      same-second duplicate, once (2026-09-24, see cancelled_duplicate_runs)
#
# **What makes them events rather than snapshots is the suppression, not the wording.** Arming is
# idempotent and is attempted on every eligible pull request on every pass, so printing on every
# successful call would reproduce the summary line's defect with a new name on it. `ARMED` is
# therefore printed only where the pull request was *not* already armed when the pass began, which
# is what `armed_before` is for; a pull request armed on Monday and still queued on Tuesday
# contributes exactly one `ARMED` line. `DEQUEUED` already had this property and only needed the
# name: it prints only when the `removed_from_merge_queue` count actually moved.
#
# The summary line stays. It answers a question the events cannot ("is anything stuck right now"),
# and it is what the examples in notes/merge-queue.md show.
#
# Arming is one API call and changes nothing until the checks pass, so every eligible pull request
# is armed on every pass. Under the merge queue that is the whole job: an armed pull request enters
# the queue when its checks go green, and the queue lands them one at a time against the tip.
