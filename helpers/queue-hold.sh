#
# PROVISIONAL NAME. Minted 2026-09-23 by this lane; not put to calef. See the `Name:` block below.
#
# # Why this exists
#
# `helpers/trunk-health.sh` says `main` is red. `helpers/merge-drain.sh` lands what does not need
# calef. Nothing implemented the response in between, and calef named the gap on 2026-09-23: *"Is
# there a missing mechanism for fixing when main goes red? It seems like the fix is enqueuing the one
# fix and holding everything else until that lands, then re-enabling everything else."*
#
# He is right, and the same evening a maintainer performed that procedure by hand, got it wrong
# twice, and left the held set in a chat message. The judgement (is this a real trunk failure, which
# pull request is the fix) is in briefs/main-is-red.md and stays a person's; this script is the
# mechanical half, which is the half that was got wrong.
#
# # The record is a label, not this script's memory
#
# The held set has to survive the session that made it, so it lives where `needs-architect` already
# lives: on the pull requests. The held queue is one command,
#
#     gh pr list --label held-for-red-trunk
#
# rather than something somebody has to have read. That is rung three of AGENTS.md's ladder (a
# written record at the thing itself), and rungs one and two are deliberately not attempted: no gate
# can tell a pull request that should be held from one that should not, and a watcher that acted on
# its own would be resolving without judgement, which notes/merge-queue.md argues against on purpose.
#
# **Nothing else is remembered, and that is a design choice rather than an omission.** The obvious
# alternative is to record each pull request's auto-merge state at hold time and restore exactly
# that. It cannot be done: GitHub clears `autoMergeRequest` the moment a pull request enters the
# queue (notes/merge-queue.md records that trap under #965), so "armed and queued" and "never armed"
# read identically. Release therefore re-arms every held pull request, which is the same admission
# policy `helpers/merge-drain.sh` applies every five minutes anyway: not a draft, into `main`, not
# `needs-architect`. Anything the drain would have armed on its next pass is armed; nothing else is.
# That is why `needs-architect` pull requests are skipped by `hold` as well as by `release`: holding
# one would be a no-op that release could only undo by arming something the drain never would.
#
# # The four steps, each one here because the obvious version of it failed (2026-09-23)
#
#   1. **Disable auto-merge first.** Dequeuing alone does not stick: with auto-merge still armed the
#      pull request re-enqueues itself within minutes. The maintainer drained the queue that evening,
#      reported it done, and found all seven back.
#   2. **Then dequeue.** `gh pr merge --disable-auto` does not remove an entry that is already in the
#      queue; only the GraphQL mutation does, and its input field is `id`, not `pullRequestId`.
#   3. **Then cancel the orphaned group builds.** GitHub leaves `gh-readonly-queue/...` runs
#      executing for entries that no longer exist. Their results cannot be consumed by anything and
#      they starve the fix of runners; 55 were cancelled by hand that evening.
#   4. **Land the fix alone**, then `release`.
#
# # BUGS
#
#   - **It cannot tell a group build that contains the fix from one that does not.** A merge-queue
#     branch is named `gh-readonly-queue/main/pr-<N>-<sha>` after the *last* entry in the group, so a
#     group holding the fix behind two other entries looks like any other orphan. The run whose name
#     carries the fix's own number is skipped; the rest are cancelled. **So hold before the fix is
#     enqueued**, which is the order briefs/main-is-red.md gives anyway. If the fix is evicted this
#     way, re-enqueue it; nothing is lost but a CI round trip.
#   - **`release` re-arms rather than restores.** See above: the pre-hold state is not recoverable
#     from the API, so a pull request that was deliberately left unarmed before the hold comes back
#     armed. In practice `helpers/merge-drain.sh` would have armed it on its next pass regardless, so
#     the window in which this differs is five minutes wide.
#   - **It does not check whether `main` is actually red.** Deliberate: the judgement is the brief's,
#     the exempt pull request is an argument, and a script that second-guessed either would be
#     resolving. `status` prints `helpers/trunk-health.sh --once` beside the held set so a reader
#     sees both facts together, and that is as far as it goes.
#   - **Nothing expires a hold.** A session that dies mid-hold leaves labelled pull requests that
#     nothing will release; the recovery list is in briefs/main-is-red.md, and it is one `release`.
#     An unreleased hold is visible (the label, and `helpers/merge-drain.sh` reporting fewer unheld
#     pull requests than there are open ones) but nothing announces it.
#   - **A hold only holds because `helpers/merge-drain.sh` agrees to honour the label.** That is a
#     coupling between two scripts and nothing enforces it: the drain runs unattended under `launchd`
#     every 300 seconds, and until 2026-09-23 it re-enqueued everything held here, three times in one
#     evening, invisibly (a dequeue leaves no trace of why an entry returned). Its admission policy
#     now excludes `held-for-red-trunk` alongside `needs-architect`. **A drain running from a
#     checkout older than that change will still undo a hold within five minutes**; stop it by hand
#     (`gh workflow disable "merge drain"`, since it is an Actions workflow now) and re-enable it on
#     release. briefs/main-is-red.md carries both commands.
#   - **`gh pr list --label` reads a search index that lags the label write.** In the 2026-09-23
#     rehearsal a `release --dry-run` run seconds after a label was added listed one held pull
#     request where the real `release` a moment later found two. So `status` immediately after
#     `hold` can under-report; give it a few seconds, and trust the labels on the pull requests
#     themselves over this listing when the two disagree.
#   - **`status` always reports the real repository's trunk**, even under `QUEUE_HOLD_REPO`:
#     `helpers/trunk-health.sh` takes no such override. That is harmless (a rehearsal repository has
#     no trunk anybody cares about) and confusing enough to be worth saying once.
#   - **It holds what is open when it runs.** A pull request opened or marked ready *during* the hold
#     is not labelled, and `helpers/merge-drain.sh` will arm it into a red trunk. Re-running `hold`
#     is idempotent and sweeps the new arrivals; nothing does that automatically.
#
# Name: unrecorded. Provisional, minted 2026-09-23 by this lane. `queue-hold` for what it does to the
# queue rather than for the mechanism, the family `merge-drain.sh` named itself into. It lives in
# `helpers/` rather than `script/` for the reason `merge-drain.sh` gives for itself: a maintainer's
# tool, not a front door a contributor types, so it carries no notes/scripts.md row (`script/lint`'s
# script-docs check only walks `script/`). The label `held-for-red-trunk` is provisional too, and
# says `trunk` rather than `main` for `trunk-health.sh`'s reason: the branch could be renamed and the
# concept could not. See notes/main-is-red.md.
