# A Claude Code Stop hook: before an agent's turn ends, read what it is about to hand the person it
# is working with, and if that reads like fixable work being reported rather than done, send it back
# once to sort the items.
#
# Why this exists, and why at this rung. AGENTS.md's "We are all owners" section says owning is not
# recording: a cheap, reversible fix reported instead of made is an evasion. That paragraph was
# written on 2026-09-23 after one violation and broken twice more on 2026-09-24, both times by a
# maintainer session on a freshly cleared context: it relayed a lane report as "things worth your
# eye" (a stale line, two pull requests to sequence) instead of doing them, and when corrected it
# saved a memory restating the rule instead of applying it. Three strikes is notes/rule-violations.md's
# threshold for moving a rule up the ladder. Prose in an 11,000-word constitution is rung four; the
# rule was in context both times and lost on salience. A hook is the harness firing it every turn,
# which is the nearest thing to rung two an agent's behaviour has.
#
# It fires at most once per turn: `stop_hook_active` is set when the agent is already continuing
# because of a Stop hook, and blocking again would loop. So a false positive costs one extra look,
# and the agent may answer it by saying every item really is an architect's call.
#
# BUGS. The phrase list is a heuristic over prose, so it misses a handoff worded some other way and
# will occasionally fire on a message that correctly hands an architect a decision. It cannot tell
# a reversible fix from a naming or syscall-surface question; the agent does that sorting when
# prompted, which is the point. It reads only the final turn's text, not what the agent did with
# tools.
#
# The text names the role, not the person: .claude/settings.json is checked in, so every
# contributor's sessions run this hook, and the needs-architect label's rule applies (calef,
# 2026-09-24, on #1216).
#
# Name: provisional. Minted 2026-09-24 by a maintainer session; calef has not ratified it.
