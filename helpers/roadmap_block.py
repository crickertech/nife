"""The milestone block's fields, read from frontmatter or from the prose form it replaces.

**Why this exists**: milestone 596 (the roadmap blocks get frontmatter too). calef ruled on
2026-09-26 (UTC) that the roadmap follows milestone 582 (a decision's status becomes a field, and
the index becomes generated) onto frontmatter, and the same day that the block carries the
dependency fields of §207 (the roadmap is a graph, and the block says so in fields a script can
walk) as keys, retiring the `**Gate:**` line. Six scripts read a block's status out of a sentence, each with
its own regex. They all read it through here now, in both forms, because three of them
(`script/metrics`, `script/catch-up`, `script/citations --moved`) read blobs from revisions that
predate the switch and will go on reading them for as long as the history is walked. The prose
reader here is therefore permanent, not transitional.

**The key names are calef's, ratified 2026-09-26 (UTC): "Yes to all."** With them he ratified
`decision_dependencies: unwritten` for a fork nobody has written up, `raised` on every block, a
`branch` for IN-PROGRESS, one format for proposals, and `superseded_by` and `refused_by` as lists
that may name a `§N`. Every key is spelled once, in `KEY` below, and every reader and the migrator
(`helpers/roadmap_migrate.py`) go through that table. `VALUE` does the same for the fixed words a
value may take.

**The format is 582's, exactly**: `---`, flat `key: value` lines, `---`. No lists and no nesting; a
list is one comma-separated value. A value may not contain `: ` or ` #`, because GitHub renders
frontmatter as YAML and either would make it something other than a string.

Name: provisional, minted by milestone 596's lane on 2026-09-26. A shared python module under
`helpers/`, which `script/names` puts out of its own scope, so this paragraph is the record. calef
names modules, and has not ratified it.
