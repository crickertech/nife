//! The std proof (milestone 27): an ordinary Rust program, no `no_std`, running on the native
//! capability ABI. Every line exercises a PAL surface: `println!` SENDs on the stdout endpoint
//! (slot 1), collections draw from the untyped budget (slot 0), `Instant` reads the virtual
//! counter, `SystemTime` reads the clock page slot 5 grants (milestone 51), `std::random` asks the
//! entropy service slot 6 grants (milestone 56), `std::env`'s `TZ`/`LANG`/`TERM` come from the
//! inert-configuration page slot 7 grants (milestone 47's environment-variable fork, DECISIONS
//! §111), and `fs` returns honestly `Unsupported`.
//!
//! The two `#![feature]`s below are about **the APIs' stability upstream, not about this platform**:
//! `std::random` (rust-lang/rust#130703) and `std::fs::Dir` (rust-lang/rust#120426) are both still
//! unstable in Rust, so any program on any target that calls them opts in the same way. Everything
//! else here is stable Rust.
#![feature(dirfd, random)]
//!
//! **One binary, three behaviours, chosen by the authority it was granted.** A std program reaches
//! the network only if it holds the network, and the filesystem only if it holds a directory (no
//! ambient authority, DECISIONS §10, §25, §27). So it probes, and its grants decide:
//!   - **granted a directory** (the loader placed an FS-service endpoint in slot 4 and mapped the
//!     page it shares with the FS server): it opens the file the RedoxFS image ships, reads it
//!     through `std::fs`, and proves that a path trying to leave the granted directory is refused.
//!   - **granted the network** (a `Stack` endpoint and a frame untyped in slots 2 and 3): it runs a
//!     real UDP DNS query and a TCP echo round trip through `std::net` (milestone 27 phase two),
//!     the same net_stack socket contract the hand-written client uses. And if its stack also
//!     carries a **listen grant**, it serves: `TcpListener` binds the granted port, refuses the
//!     one nobody granted, and answers connections a host process opens into the guest (milestone
//!     64's inbound half). That is a fourth behaviour chosen by a fourth authority, on the same
//!     principle as the three above; the grant is `net_stack`'s spawn word, not anything this
//!     program can ask for.
//!   - **granted neither**: both return `Unsupported`, and the program runs the phase-one
//!     transcript, proving the collections, timing, and the honest refusals. Every run, not only
//!     this one, is also always granted a clock, entropy, and an inert-configuration page (slots
//!     5, 6 and 7); the fs/net branch above is the only thing chosen by absence, so this bullet's
//!     "neither" is about the filesystem and the network specifically, not about everything the
//!     spawn wires in.
//!
//! One binary keeps the initrd inside its nifefs directory limit (`MAX_FILES`, 31 entries when
//! this was written and 76 since 2026-08-01) while still proving all three. The kernel test suite spawns it three ways and checks each transcript
//! byte for byte, on both ISAs.

/// **The gating UDP round trip: slirp's own TFTP server**, the `std::net` twin of `socket_test_client`'s

/// request and its reply never leave the emulator.
///
/// This used to be a DNS A-record query for `example.com` at 10.0.2.3:53, which is *not* a resolver:
/// libslirp NATs anything sent there to the HOST's nameserver, so the test silently depended on the
/// developer's DNS answering at that instant and flaked at roughly 2.5% per query. That was fixed for
/// the hand-built `socket_test_client` gate and **missed here**, which is why this twin went on flaking after the
/// fix landed; it cost a riscv leg on 2026-07-29. The lesson is worth the sentence: a fix applied to
/// one of two call sites of the same hazard is half a fix, and the surviving half is harder to find
/// because the record says the problem is solved.
///
/// What it proves is what the DNS version was there to prove about *our* code and nothing about the
/// host: a program holding no capability and no socket id sends a datagram through `std::net` to an
/// address it chooses and reads the reply back. Send a read request (opcode 1, `octet` mode) for the
/// fixture the runners planted, and require the first data packet: opcode 3, block 1, the fixture's
/// bytes exactly. The fixture is one short block, so the whole file arrives in that packet.
