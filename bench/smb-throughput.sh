# Measure file throughput THROUGH A MOUNTED SMB SHARE, at each of the file contract's transfer
# sizes (milestone 55).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is the whole reason it is a second script rather than a flag on its
# sibling. bench/transfer-size-sweep.sh measures milestone 138 step 3 against `filesystem_proto`, by a
# client that speaks the file contract directly, and it found 8.02x on a sequential write. Nothing
# a customer runs speaks that contract. A Mac's bytes arrive through TCP, the socket contract, a
# reassembly buffer and an SMB2 state machine, and only then become an `fs::WRITE`. So a speedup on
# the contract is a claim about the contract until somebody measures the path a backup takes, and
# this is that measurement.
#
# WHAT IT DOES. `filesystem_proto::fs::TRANSFER_PAGES` is how many contiguous pages a client and the FS
# server share, and setting it to 1 reproduces the contract exactly as it stood before step 3 (the
# SMB adapter derives its own chunk size from it, which is the change milestone 55 made). This
# script therefore EDITS THAT CONSTANT IN PLACE, builds, runs the aarch64 kernel suite with the
# throughput leg turned on, and puts it back. It restores on any exit, including a signal, and
# refuses to start if that file is already dirty, so it can never restore over somebody else's
# edit. That is its sibling's discipline, unchanged.
#
# The leg lives in xtask's SMB prober (`smb_throughput_leg`): a host process, over a real forwarded
# TCP connection, writing 1 MiB and reading it back in `smb_proto::MAX_TRANSACT`-sized messages.
# 1 MiB is `filesystem_proto::fixture::throughput::TOTAL`, so a row here and a row from the in-guest
# benchmark are the same work seen through two different depths of the stack.
#
# USAGE
#
#     sh bench/smb-throughput.sh [ROUNDS] [PAGES...]
#     sh bench/smb-throughput.sh 3 1 16      # the before and the after, three rounds each
#
# Defaults: 3 rounds, 1 and 16 pages (4 KiB and 64 KiB).
#
# OUTPUT is one tab-separated row per direction per round on stdout:
#
#     pages<TAB>round<TAB>load<TAB>direction<TAB>mib_per_s
#
# BUGS
#
# - **The ceiling is SMB's, not the file contract's.** This server negotiates 64 KiB for
#   `MaxReadSize` and `MaxWriteSize` (`smb_proto::MAX_TRANSACT`), so a real client never asks for
#   more than that however large `TRANSFER_PAGES` becomes, and a point past 16 pages measures
#   nothing new on this path. Raising it means raising both numbers.
# - **A full kernel suite per point**, which is minutes, because the leg runs inside the boot that
#   the SMB gate already stages and there is no smaller boot that has a mounted share in it. The
#   timed window is only the leg; everything else is wall clock spent to get there.
# - It does not check that the machine is quiet; it records the load so you can tell afterwards.
# - The write leg's bytes stay on the fixture image (16 MiB, copy-on-write). A run that has been
#   repeated many times against a stale image can meet STATUS_DISK_FULL; the image regenerates from
#   `crates/nifefs`, so deleting it is the fix.
