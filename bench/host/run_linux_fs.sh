# Same-hardware, same-tier Linux/ext4 run of milestone 38's filesystem throughput phases.
#
# It boots the SAME Alpine kernel run_linux.sh uses, on the SAME `virt,accel=hvf` machine with the
# SAME `-cpu host`, `-m 256M`, `-smp 4` and the SAME `virtio-blk-device` on a raw host image file
# that helpers/qemu-runner-aarch64.sh gives nife's own bench boot. That matching is the whole point:
# the two filesystems then differ in the filesystem and in nothing under it.
#
# Needs: rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl; qemu-system-aarch64; network (once, for the
# kernel); and podman, which calef already runs. Podman is here because macOS ships neither an ext4
# formatter nor an unsquashfs, both of which this needs and both of which are one `apk add` away
# inside a container; `brew install e2fsprogs squashfs` would serve as well.
#
# BUGS: the scratch image is built under the repository's own `target/` rather than in $TMPDIR,
# because the podman machine only shares paths under the user's home directory and /tmp is not one
# of them. If you point WORK elsewhere, point it somewhere podman can see.
#
# Run: sh bench/host/run_linux_fs.sh

# **The Alpine `virt` kernel does not have ext4 built in**, which is the one thing about this that
# is not obvious: it is a netboot kernel and keeps its filesystems in `modloop-virt`, a squashfs.
# `mount("ext4")` from a one-file initramfs therefore answers ENODEV, which is what the first
# version of this script did. So the five modules ext4 needs are lifted out of that squashfs here
# and loaded by the bench itself (`finit_module`), which keeps the guest a single binary and keeps
# the boot free of a second disk.
