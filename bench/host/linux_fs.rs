//! **The ext4 side of milestone 38's filesystem-throughput comparison.** Built as a static aarch64
//! binary and booted as PID 1 in a one-file initramfs under QEMU-HVF, on the *same* M-series core,
//! at the *same* virtualization tier, through the *same* virtio-blk-device model and the *same*
//! raw host image file as nife's own bench boot. It mounts a scratch ext4 disk, runs the four
//! phases `filesystem_proto::fixture::throughput` defines, prints them, and powers the machine off (it is
//! PID 1: exiting would panic the kernel).
//!
//! # What it measures, and why there are two variants of everything
//!
//! nife's FS server holds no **data** cache: a record body is always a virtio round trip (batched
//! since milestone 138 step 4, but never answered from memory), and every write is its own RedoxFS
//! transaction that commits before the reply. It does hold a small **metadata** cache since step 2
//! (`redoxfs_server::CachedDisk`, 64 blocks, ~257 KiB): a repeated read of the same file's tree spine
//! answers from memory rather than a second round trip, which is why `fs_read` (a repeated read of
//! one small inline file) is no longer comparable to a cold read the way it was when this file's
//! comment last described it as cacheless. The phases this file runs are dominated by record
//! bodies, which the metadata cache never touches, so the comparison below is still the honest one
//! for what it measures; it would not be for a workload that mostly reopens hot metadata. Linux is
//! the opposite by default in both dimensions: the page cache absorbs data reads and writeback
//! absorbs writes, and a 1 MiB file fits in it entirely.
//!
//! So a single ext4 number would answer a question nobody asked. This runs each phase twice:
//!
//! - **buffered**: ordinary `open`/`pread`/`pwrite`. What a Linux program actually gets, and the
//!   number to quote when someone asks how fast Linux is.
//! - **direct**: `O_DIRECT` for reads, `O_DIRECT | O_DSYNC` for writes. No page cache, and a write
//!   is durable before it returns. That is the closest thing Linux has to what our path does on
//!   every single request, and it is the only one of the two that is apples to apples.
//!
//! Both still enjoy one thing we do not: the host's own page cache under QEMU, since the drive is
//! attached `cache=writeback` (QEMU's default, and what the nife runner uses). That is matched
//! rather than removed, which is the point of running at the same tier.
//!
//! Build static and boot it with `sh bench/host/run_linux_fs.sh`.
