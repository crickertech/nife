//! **The APFS side of milestone 38's filesystem-throughput comparison**, on this laptop's own
//! filesystem, natively.
//!
//! # This one is NOT at a matched tier, and that is the first thing to know about it
//!
//! `bench/host/linux_fs.rs` boots under QEMU-HVF on the same machine model, the same `-cpu host`,
//! the same `virtio-blk-device` and the same raw host image file that nife's bench boot uses, so
//! nife and ext4 differ in the filesystem and in nothing below it. This program has none of that.
//! It runs on macOS directly, on APFS, on the real NVMe device, with no virtio and no host image
//! file in the way. It is therefore **a reference point, not a competitor**: it says what the
//! hardware and a production filesystem can do when nothing is virtualized, which is the ceiling
//! the other two are working under, and any ratio taken against it is measuring the tier as much as
//! the filesystem. milestone 25 made the same call for the primitive suite and said so the same
//! way.
//!
//! # Three variants, for the reason `linux_fs.rs` gives
//!
//! - **buffered**: ordinary reads and writes, served by the unified buffer cache.
//! - **nocache**: `fcntl(F_NOCACHE)`, macOS's nearest thing to `O_DIRECT`. The bytes still go to
//!   the device's own cache; nothing is flushed.
//! - **fullsync**: `nocache` plus `fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC)` after every write, which is macOS's real
//!   barrier (`fsync` on macOS does *not* flush the drive cache, which is the whole reason
//!   `F_FULLFSYNC` exists). Strictly stronger than what nife's FS server does per write, and
//!   printed so the strongest and weakest readings are both on the page.
//!
//! Native numbers are statistical (a shared desktop underneath), so take a median of a few runs.
//!
//! Build and run natively (no Cargo, so it does not fight the aarch64 workspace target):
//!   rustc -O --edition 2021 bench/host/macos_fs.rs -o /tmp/macos_fs && /tmp/macos_fs
