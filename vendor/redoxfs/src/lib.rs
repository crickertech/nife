// nife pin divergence (milestone 138): **the level a new file is created at**, lowered from
// upstream's 5 to 1, so a record is 4 KiB << 1 = 8 KiB rather than 128 KiB. Every file request in
// this system carries at most one 4 KiB page (`filesystem_proto::PAGE`), so a 128 KiB record fetched 32
// blocks to serve one of them and rewrote all 32 to change one. Measured on milestone 38's harness:
// a 4 KiB read goes from 1,458 us to 284 us. Level 1 rather than 0 because RedoxFS compresses a
// record only when it is larger than one block, so level 0 gives up lz4 for 8.7% more read speed
// and roughly twice the space overhead. See notes/benchmarks.md and vendor/README.md divergence 5.

// nife pin divergence (milestone 138): **the largest level this build can read.** Upstream needed
// only one constant because the level a new file is CREATED at and the largest level a build can
// READ were the same number by construction. They stop being the same the moment the first is
// lowered, and the difference is not cosmetic: `record_level` is a per-node field in the on-disk
// format, so an image written by any other build carries whatever level that build chose, and the
// two `BlockTrait::empty` guards (`record.rs`, `htree.rs`) refuse a level above this constant,
// which `read_block` turns into `ENOENT` on a perfectly good image.
//
// Holding the ceiling at upstream's 5 is what makes lowering the default **reversible**. Nothing
// stored at any level from 0 to 5 becomes unreadable, and a future change to `RECORD_LEVEL` cannot
// orphan data written by this one. It is also half of what a genuine per-file level would need: the
// guards already compare against a maximum rather than against the default.

// nife pin divergence (milestone 138): the **ceiling** rather than the default, because the one
// thing this sizes is the lz4 scratch buffer in `filesystem.rs`, which has to fit any record this
// build might rewrite, including one an older image created at level 5.
