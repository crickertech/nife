//! **`disk_surveyor`**: what drives are attached, and how the one we hold is divided up
//! (milestone 57, notes/block-devices.md).
//!
//! A surveyor maps land they do not own, and that is exactly the shape of this program's
//! endowment. It holds two things that look like one thing on every other operating system:
//!
//! - a **`READ`-only capability on the roster page**, which says what block devices exist
//!   (`block_roster`); and
//! - a **block-service endpoint**, which lets it read and write the blocks of **one** device
//!   (`filesystem_proto::blk`).
//!
//! Since milestone 108 the roster is a `PageFrame` this program holds and maps itself, rather than a
//! page the kernel wired into its address space before it started. The practical difference is at
//! the top of [`probe`]: `READ` on the capability means a writable mapping cannot be *obtained*,
//! where a read-only mapping only meant a write could not *land*.
//!
//! On Linux those are the same authority in practice: `/sys/block` is world-readable, `/dev/sda` is
//! a path, and a tool that can see a disk can usually be pointed at it. `parted /dev/sda` as root
//! reaches every disk in the machine, which is why calef's own router instructions carry a "confirm
//! the target device path before proceeding" warning: the tool cannot enforce what the warning
//! asks. **Here the warning is structural.** This program was handed one disk. There is no path to
//! type, no second device to typo into, and nothing in the roster that can be turned into a handle.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! Reads LBA 1 of the disk it holds and parses the GUID Partition Table there, then checks the
//! backup table at the far end of the disk against it, then reports. `crates/gpt` does every byte
//! of the judging; this file is the I/O and nothing else, which is why the parser is host-tested
//! against tables written by `sgdisk` and macOS `diskutil` and this program is tested by being run.
//!
//! Reading the table is the part that is not optional. A block device hands you an undifferentiated
//! run of blocks, and **which of them is a filesystem is written in the table and nowhere else**, so
//! a machine that cannot read a GPT cannot find a partition on a disk it did not create.
//!
//! # The two roles
//!
//! | `a0` | |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`ROLE_SURVEY`] | enumerate, read the table, report |
//! | [`ROLE_PROBE`] | announce the roster's address, write to it, and die |
//!
//! The second is the negative control, and it is a claim rather than a formality: **the roster is a
//! listing, not a lever.** The page is mapped read-only, so a program that knows exactly where it
//! is still cannot add a device to it, remove one, or point itself at a disk it was not given. The
//! kernel-side test watches the fault land at that address.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//!   ROLE_SURVEY on the milestone-57 test disk (a 64 MiB image sgdisk partitioned):
//!     roster : 4 devices, 3 virtio-mmio, 1 virtio-pci
//!     table  : 3 partitions, disk GUID 1A2B3C4D-5E6F-4718-9A0B-C1D2E3F40506
//!              1  EFI system    2048..10239
//!              2  linux root   10240..30719
//!              3  nife data 30720..131038
//!     backup : agrees with the primary
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The logical block size is assumed to be 512.** Every disk this project has met reports 512,
//!   `crates/gpt` handles 4096 and is tested at it, and the block service does not carry the
//!   device's logical block size on the wire, so there is nothing here to read it from. A 4Kn disk
//!   would be read as though its LBA 1 were at byte 512, which is a wrong answer rather than an
//!   error. The fix is a field in `filesystem_proto::blk`, not a change here.
//! - **It does not write.** Partitioning a disk from nife needs a unique GUID per partition,
//!   which needs randomness, which this program is not endowed with. `crates/gpt` refuses to invent
//!   one and notes/gpt.md says why. That is milestone 57's remaining half and it is a decision
//!   rather than a task; see design/roadmap/57-partitioning-and-xattrs.md.
//! - **No hot plug.** The roster is written once at wiring time and never again.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-03 (calef, milestone 57). The lane shipped it provisionally and calef
//! approved it by name. A surveyor maps land they do not own, which is this program's endowment
//! exactly: a read-only mapping of the roster page that says what devices exist, plus a
//! block-service endpoint for one of them.

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
