//! **The boot-time re-deriver** (milestone 152's third piece, provisional name; DECISIONS §123): a
//! `root_supervisor`-shaped boot-only process that re-establishes durable-session authority fresh at
//! boot, the way a login would, with no live person presenting a credential at that moment.
//!
//! # What it is given, and what it does with it
//!
//! Two capabilities and nothing else: a construction budget ([`UT`], a `MemoryRegion`) and read access
//! to the durable schedule store ([`FS_EP`], the principal tree's root directory capability, the
//! same unnarrowed shape `login.rs` and `identity_provisioner.rs` already hold theirs in). It:
//!
//! 1. Reads [`schedule_store::MANIFEST_FILE_NAME`] at the store's root and parses it
//!    ([`schedule_store::parse_manifest`]): the hard-wired set of identities that currently have a
//!    durable session with pending scheduled work (DECISIONS §125, this lane's own answer to the gap
//!    neither §122 nor §123 fully specified).
//! 2. For every identity the manifest names, reads that identity's own
//!    [`schedule_store::SCHEDULE_FILE_NAME`] file (DECISIONS §117's per-identity subtree, §122's
//!    format) and parses it with [`timetable::parse`] unchanged, proving §122's write path (this
//!    lane's own `user/src/fs_test_client.rs::ROLE_SCHEDULE_SEED`) and this read path agree on the
//!    same bytes through a real filesystem round trip, not a fixture.
//! 3. Mints and tears down one synthetic per-identity session, in `smb_server.rs`'s
//!    `DurableSession`'s own two-step shape (split a session region off [`UT`], split a pending-job
//!    region off *that*, prove `MemoryRegion::DESTROY` on the session refuses while the job lives and
//!    succeeds once it does not): the demonstration that boot-time re-derivation produces something
//!    with the identical §16 lifecycle a live login's `DurableSession` already has, without wiring a
//!    real registrar (#387, explicitly out of this lane's scope; see the roadmap doc).
//! 4. Deletes its own copies of [`FS_EP`] and [`UT`] (`cap_delete`, not `MemoryRegion::DESTROY`: this
//!    process is giving up its own *name* for the store and the budget, not tearing either down),
//!    then attempts a further store read and a further construction and asserts both now fail,
//!    reporting the proof over [`REPORT`] rather than merely asserting it in a comment
//!    (`root_supervisor.rs`'s own idiom, lines 168-182, applied here to a directory endpoint and an
//!    `MemoryRegion` instead of `ROOT_UT` alone).
//!
//! # Why this is a boot-only process rather than a phase of an existing one
//!
//! DECISIONS §123 leaves "a new dedicated process or a phase folded into `root_supervisor` or
//! `system_initializer`" explicitly open as "a smaller, more reversible question this decision does
//! not need to settle." This lane picked a **new, dedicated process**, for the reason
//! `AGENTS.md`'s "recommend on reversible forks" latitude exists to cover: a new binary is the
//! smaller and more reversible change, here, of the two. Folding this into `system_initializer`
//! would mean growing `crates/system_initializer::boot` (already the kernel's largest single
//! function) with a second privileged phase that runs once and then must itself prove its
//! capabilities are gone, which is real surgery on a component every boot depends on; a new process
//! wired the way `identity_provisioner` and `login` already are (spawned directly, holding exactly
//! two capabilities, nothing that names any other component) touches nothing else in the tree. If
//! this is folded into an existing boot component later, that is a smaller, later change than
//! un-folding one would have been.
//!
//! # What this lane proves, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! **Proves**: the store write path (§122, this lane's own `ROLE_SCHEDULE_SEED`) and the store
//! read-at-boot path connect through a real filesystem round trip; the manifest (§125) answers "which
//! identities" without enumeration (every `OPENDIR`/`OPEN` this process ever issues names something
//! it already learned from a document it holds a capability to read, never a `READDIR`); a
//! boot-time-re-derived session has the same §16 lifecycle a live login's does; and the re-deriver's
//! own capabilities are provably gone after its one pass, in `root_supervisor`'s exact shape.
//!
//! **Does not build**: a real scheduled-job registrar against `DurableSession` (#387/milestone 129,
//! this lane's own explicit non-goal); real per-identity narrowing of [`FS_EP`] (a caretaker built
//! per identity, `login.rs`'s `mint()` shape, rather than the one shared, unnarrowed capability this
//! process holds for its whole run) -- named honestly in this program's own BUGS below, matching
//! `identity_provisioner.rs`'s own recorded bound for the identical gap; the liveness watchdog
//! DECISIONS §123's hardening addendum names and explicitly declines to design (refinement 4); and
//! wiring this process into a real boot (`crates/system_initializer::boot` or an interactive
//! `cargo xtask shell-check`) rather than the kernel test harness that spawns it here
//! (`kernel/src/user/session_reviver_service.rs`), the same "not wired into the interactive boot"
//! bound `login.rs`'s own BUGS names for itself.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//! - slot [`REPORT`]: `WRITE`. One report, then this process exits; it does not loop.
//! - slot [`UT`]: `WRITE` on a fresh `MemoryRegion`, the construction budget every synthetic per-identity
//!   session (step 3 above) is `MemoryRegion::SPLIT` from, sized by whoever spawns this process the way
//!   `login.rs`'s own `mint()` sizes a caretaker's construction budget (DECISIONS §123: "a
//!   construction budget... sized for however many durable sessions the store names").
//! - slot [`FS_EP`]: `WRITE` on the principal tree's root directory capability, the store-read
//!   capability DECISIONS §123 names as this process's other grant. Unnarrowed in this slice's own
//!   wiring; see this program's BUGS.
//! - mapped [`FS_VA`]: one page shared with the FS server, the channel every request in this
//!   contract stages a name into or reads a result out of. One page is enough: every read this
//!   process ever performs (the manifest, one identity's `schedule` file) is well under
//!   `filesystem_proto::PAGE` bytes, unlike `fs_test_client.rs`'s own channel, which maps the whole
//!   `fs::TRANSFER_MAX` width for its throughput role.
//!
//! Name: provisional, `session_reviver`, minted by this lane 2026-08-24. A noun for what it does
//! (revive, in the sense DECISIONS §123's own roadmap doc used first: "boot-time bring-up is
//! re-derivation, not restoration") to the thing it acts on (a durable session). §123's own text
//! floated this exact placeholder ("something like `session_reviver`"); this lane used it rather
//! than inventing a second one. calef's call to ratify per AGENTS.md.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **[`FS_EP`] is unnarrowed for this process's whole run, identically to `identity_provisioner.rs`'s
//! own recorded bound for the same capability.** DECISIONS §123's first hardening refinement asks for
//! the window to shrink *per identity* using `MemoryRegion::SPLIT`, and this process does that for the
//! *construction budget* (step 3: one session's worth of [`UT`] is split off, used, and destroyed
//! before the next identity's), but not for the *directory* capability: every `OPENDIR`/`OPEN` this
//! process issues goes through the one [`FS_EP`] it was granted at spawn, held for the whole pass
//! rather than narrowed to one identity's own subtree via a fresh `fs_subtree_caretaker` (`login.rs`'s
//! `mint()` shape) and torn down before the next identity. Building that would need this process to
//! also hold the caretaker's own ELF bytes and a measured-boot check on them, which is real additional
//! machinery this lane judged out of proportion to what it demonstrates: this process already never
//! *requests* more than `filesystem_proto::dir::READ | filesystem_proto::dir::DESCEND` on any
//! `OPENDIR` (never `ENUMERATE`, so it cannot list what it was not told), so the residual risk this
//! leaves is a compromised re-deriver reading (not writing, not enumerating) every identity's schedule
//! rather than only the one currently being processed. A real deployment building on this shape should
//! close that gap; this lane records it rather than building it, matching the disclosure `login.rs` and
//! `identity_provisioner.rs` already carry for the identical bound.
//!
//! **The manifest is trusted by construction, not verified against a signature or a measured-boot
//! table.** DECISIONS §123's second hardening refinement (gate the re-deriver's own binary through
//! measured boot before it is granted anything) is built, but only for *this process's own bytes*
//! (`kernel/src/user/session_reviver_service.rs` checks them before spawning, mirroring
//! `crates/system_initializer::boot`'s own discipline for every component it spawns). The manifest
//! and schedule *documents themselves* carry no equivalent of measured boot: their trust rests on the
//! roadmap doc's own argument ("the durable store itself only ever having been written by an
//! already-authenticated action"), which this lane's demonstration writer does not itself
//! authenticate (`ROLE_SCHEDULE_SEED` is a kernel-test fixture, not a real registrar). A real
//! deployment's trust chain for the store's own contents is #387's problem, not this lane's.
