//! **The credential service's clients** (milestone 56, the credential half; notes/credentials.md).
//!
//! One binary, three roles, because a program that shares the honest path is a fairer test of a
//! boundary than a different program failing for its own reasons. Every role holds **exactly the
//! same endowment**: the verify endpoint, a report endpoint, and the page it writes its request
//! into. No store, no provision endpoint, no entropy, no budget.
//!
//! - [`ROLE_HONEST`] is what any authenticating server would be: it asks three questions and reports the
//!   three answers, plus whether the shared page came back clean.
//! - [`ROLE_ATTACKER`] holds the identical endowment and tries to *write* the store through it:
//!   `PUT`, `SEAL`, an opcode nobody defined, and lengths outside the contract. Then it asks
//!   whether the credential it tried to install works. It must not.
//! - [`ROLE_PROVISIONER`] is the one that runs *before* either, on the **provision** endpoint, and
//!   is a separate role rather than a separate binary so that the difference between provisioning
//!   and verifying is visible as one field of a `Spawn` literal: which endpoint is in slot 0.
//!
//! # What the attacker proves, and what it does not
//!
//! It does not prove that a permission check works, because there is no permission check. It
//! proves the shape: by the time this program runs, the provision endpoint has been deleted at
//! both ends, so `PUT` is not a request that gets refused, it is a word with no object behind it.
//! The serve loop it reaches implements one opcode. See user/src/credentialer.rs.
//!
//! # Capability contract (notes/abi.md §4)
//!
//! - slot 0: the credential service's endpoint (WRITE). **Which one is the whole story**: the
//!   provision endpoint for [`ROLE_PROVISIONER`], the verify endpoint for the other two.
//! - slot 1: the report endpoint (WRITE)
//! - mapped: one shared page, at [`PAGE_VA`] for a client and [`PROV_VA`] for the provisioner
//! - `a0`: the role
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `credcli`. Refused `credcli` (a
//! squished abbreviation) and `credentialer_client` (that name belongs to the real client milestone
//! 55 needs for SMB authentication, and giving it to a test program squats it). `witness` was
//! considered for the family and set aside: it is standard in proof theory, model checking and
//! cryptography, but `client` carries information about what the program is that `witness` does
//! not.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
