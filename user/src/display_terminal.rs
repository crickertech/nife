//! **The display terminal** (milestone 29, the display ladder's text).
//!
//! The component that makes the framebuffer readable: it serves the terminal contract's IPC half
//! (notes/terminal-contract.md) against a **grid and a font** instead of a serial line, and puts the
//! result on a screen it does not own.
//!
//! ```text
//!   application ──OP_WRITE──►┌──────────┐──glyphs──► its surface ──FLUSH/COMMIT──► a screen
//!   keystrokes ──OP_BYTES───►│  display_terminal   │
//!                            └──────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! # It is a client, twice over, and that is the whole point
//!
//! The same binary runs in two wirings, chosen by `arg0`, and neither of them holds a device:
//!
//! - [`MODE_DISPLAY`]: it holds rung one's **display endpoint** and the
//!   scanout frames, exactly the authority `painter` had, and shows text on the whole screen. This
//!   is the wiring that answers "did the framebuffer contract need to change for text?" The answer
//!   is no: it draws pixels and calls `FLUSH` with a damage rectangle, which is what the contract
//!   already said a client does.
//! - [`MODE_WINDOW`]: it holds rung two's **doorbell** and one window's
//!   control page and surface, exactly the authority `window` had, and shows text in a window
//!   among mutually distrusting neighbours.
//!
//! In both, its whole world is: a report endpoint, one endpoint to present through, **one endpoint
//! it serves** (slot 2), a page an application writes text into, and its own pixels. No device, no
//! interrupt, no DMA authority, no physical address, and no way to name another client's anything.
//!
//! # One endpoint, because this process has one wait point
//!
//! A terminal has two classes of sender: an application printing, and an input source typing.
//! DECISIONS §33 recorded that a process here has exactly **one blocking wait point** (one `RECV`,
//! no wait-any, and two threads cannot share an address space), so distinguishing them by endpoint
//! is not available. They arrive on **one** endpoint and are distinguished by opcode, which is what
//! `line_editor` already does for the serial terminal, and the security consequence is stated rather than
//! hidden: an application holding this endpoint could send `OP_BYTES` and forge a keystroke into its
//! own terminal. It gains nothing by it (the keystrokes come back to the same grid it is already
//! printing on), and the boundary that matters, one client's input not reaching another's, is the
//! compositor's and is a capability there. See notes/glyphs.md.
//!
//! # Why input does not ring the doorbell, and the deadlock that taught us
//!
//! In [`MODE_WINDOW`] the compositor delivers a keystroke by **`CALL`ing this process** and blocking
//! until it replies (DECISIONS §33). So a terminal that answered a keystroke by ringing the doorbell
//! would deadlock the moment two keystrokes arrived in one drain: the compositor would be blocked in
//! its `CALL` to us while we were blocked in our `CALL` to it.
//!
//! It does not need to. The compositor rescans **every** client's control page on every `COMMIT`
//! from anyone, and the input source rings `COMMIT` itself after it fills the ring. So the frame
//! that delivers the keystroke is the frame that will show it: this process paints, records its
//! damage, bumps its sequence, and replies. Application output is different (nobody else is going to
//! ring for it), so `OP_WRITE` does ring, and that is safe because the caller blocked in `CALL` is
//! the *application*, not the compositor.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `vterm`. Refused `vterm` (an
//! abbreviation), `text_console` (`console` is already a program) and `video_terminal` for the
//! program (the crate is named for the protocol it implements and this program for its role, next
//! to `display`, the virtio-gpu driver it is a client of, so the display ladder reads straight from
//! the filenames).

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
