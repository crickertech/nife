//! **`disk_partitioner`**: writes the map `disk_surveyor` reads (milestone 57, notes/gpt.md).
//!
//! The destructive half of the pair, and the one whose endowment is the point. It holds exactly
//! two things:
//!
//! - a **block-service endpoint** for **one** disk (`filesystem_proto::blk`), which is the authority to
//!   destroy that disk and no other; and
//! - an **entropy endpoint** (`entropy_proto`), which is the authority to obtain random bytes and
//!   nothing else: it cannot reach the virtio-rng device, program its queue, or see the page the
//!   device writes into.
//!
//! **Both are required and neither is sufficient**, which is a claim the wiring can make and
//! `parted` cannot. A GPT gives every partition a globally unique id, and an id that is not random
//! is not unique; `crates/gpt` therefore refuses to invent one (notes/gpt.md), so this program
//! **without the entropy endpoint writes nothing at all** rather than falling back to a counter.
//! The kernel-side test spawns it both ways and reads the disk afterwards to see which happened.
//!
//! Compare `parted /dev/sda` as root: one authority, obtained by typing a path, reaching every disk
//! in the machine, with `/dev/urandom` always there for the asking. calef's own router instructions
//! carry a "confirm the target device path before proceeding" warning precisely because nothing in
//! that arrangement can enforce it. **Here the warning is structural**: this program was handed one
//! disk and there is no path to type.
//!
//! # The two roles
//!
//! | `a0` | |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`ROLE_PARTITION`] | draw four GUIDs, lay out a table, write both copies |
//! | [`ROLE_VERIFY`] | read the disk back and report what is on it |
//!
//! `ROLE_VERIFY` is a **separate process with no entropy endpoint**, deliberately: a writer that
//! checks its own work proves the least interesting thing available, and the verify role is also
//! what turns "the refusal wrote nothing" from an assertion into a reading.
//!
//! # What it writes
//!
//! The layout is `filesystem_proto::fixture::blank`, three partitions on a 64 MiB disk in the 2048-block
//! alignment every real tool uses. Placement is this program's decision and not the crate's:
//! `Gpt::create` validates a layout and refuses to move one, because alignment is policy and a
//! format library that quietly relocated a partition would be doing policy behind its caller's
//! back.
//!
//! Every block written is **read first** and the table bytes laid over it. That matters on a disk
//! that is not blank: the primary table is 34 logical blocks and the transfer unit is eight of
//! them, so the tail of the last transfer block is somebody's data, and a partitioner that wrote
//! whole transfer blocks would zero the first 3 KiB of a partition it was only supposed to be
//! describing.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//!   ROLE_PARTITION, wired with a disk AND an entropy endpoint:
//!     report: R_PARTITIONED, 3 partitions
//!
//!   ROLE_PARTITION, wired with the disk and NO entropy endpoint:
//!     report: R_NO_ENTROPY, 0 partitions          (and the disk is untouched)
//!
//!   ROLE_VERIFY, afterwards:
//!     report: F_MBR|F_PRIMARY|F_BACKUP|F_NIFE|F_NAMES, 3 partitions, data at LBA 30720
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The logical block size is assumed to be 512**, the same assumption and the same reason as
//!   `disk_surveyor`: nothing in `filesystem_proto::blk` carries the device's, and every disk this project
//!   has met reports 512. Writing a table with the wrong unit produces a table no other OS can
//!   read, which is worse than a wrong answer on the read side. The fix is a field on the wire.
//! - **It writes one hard-coded layout.** There is no `mkpart` command line, no partition sizing,
//!   and no way to ask for a different type GUID; the layout is the fixture's. What this
//!   demonstrates is the *authority*, and a command line is the smaller half of the work left.
//! - **Nothing here is crash-atomic.** A kill partway through leaves a disk with one copy of the
//!   table written and the other stale, which `Gpt::check_backup` reports as a mismatch. Real
//!   partitioners have the same property; the difference is that milestone 37 measured the
//!   filesystem's crash behaviour and nothing has measured this one's.
//! - **The unique GUIDs are not checked for collision against the disk's existing table**, because
//!   the table is being replaced wholesale. A future `mkpart` that adds an entry to a table it did
//!   not write must check.
//!
//! Name: provisional (§89's state, adopted 2026-08-16; this block wrote the workaround that
//! argued for it). The clearest ratification owed on this surface. The introducing commit (4db2fd7, 2026-08-03, milestone 57) says
//! "`disk_partitioner` (provisional name) writes the map `disk_surveyor` reads" and calls its
//! sibling "`fs_maker` (provisional name)" in the same breath. So the record does not explain the
//! word; it records that nobody decided it. That sibling is `fs_server/src/bin/mkfs.rs` now, which
//! is a second provisional name resolved by somebody mid-task on a surface this record does not
//! cover (see notes/naming.md's BUGS). `disk_surveyor` calef approved by name the same day,
//! and the pairing of the two (survey, partition) is visible in the tree without being written
//! down anywhere.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
