//! A client of the net server's socket contract (milestone 30, piece 3 phase B).
//!
//! It exercises the capability-shaped contract from the outside: mint a shared frame from its own
//! untyped budget, delegate it to the net server, and drive real network exchanges through socket
//! ids on the `Stack` endpoint, no ambient network anywhere. It holds a capability to the stack or
//! it does not; here it was granted one.
//!
//! The exchanges, selected by the entry role, all against QEMU user-mode networking with zero host
//! setup:
//!   - `TEST_UDP_TFTP`: a UDP request/response round trip against **slirp's own built-in TFTP
//!     server** (10.0.2.2:69), which libslirp answers itself with no host network involved. This is
//!     the gating UDP test: deterministic and offline, the UDP twin of the guestfwd echo peer.
//!   - `TEST_UDP_DNS`: a real DNS query for `example.com` via 10.0.2.3:53. **This leaves the
//!     machine.** 10.0.2.3 is not a resolver; libslirp NATs anything sent there to the *host's*
//!     configured nameserver (`get_dns_addr_libresolv`), so this exchange depends on the developer's
//!     DNS working at that instant. It is therefore **non-gating**: a host resolver that does not
//!     answer reports `NO_ANSWER` and the kernel test skips loudly. A malformed or mismatched
//!     response still fails, because that would be our bug. See notes/net.md.
//!   - `TEST_TCP_ECHO`: a full TCP round trip to slirp's guestfwd echo peer (10.0.2.9:7777 -> a
//!     `/bin/cat`): connect (handshake), send, receive the echo, close (teardown).
//!   - `TEST_TCP_ACCEPT`: **the inbound half** (milestone 107), and the only exchange here that is
//!     not the guest as a client. A port outside the stack's listen grant is refused as a matter of
//!     authority, the granted one binds and is exclusive, and then a *host* process connects to it
//!     through QEMU's `hostfwd` twice, which proves the listener re-arms.
//!     The same spawn then carries **the UDP bind grant's refusals** (milestone 55), because a
//!     second net server does not fit the aarch64 boot (the memory receipt in notes/net.md; that
//!     lane re-measured it: an eleventh spawn died as `Unmappable(OutOfPageFrames)` in an unrelated
//!     later test). A fixed port outside the grant is refused as authority, a granted one binds
//!     and is exclusive, which incidentally proves the two grant halves compose in one word on the
//!     machine. The traffic that used to ride here belongs to `mdns_responder` now: it is a third
//!     client of this same stack, it holds 5353 for the whole run, and it proves the multicast
//!     path with real DNS rather than with marker payloads.
//!
//! On success it reports `OK`; any failure reports a stage code, so the kernel test fails loudly
//! with a hint rather than hanging.
//!
//! This is a **module of the `net_stack` binary** (dispatched by its entry role), not a separate binary,
//! because the initrd archive's directory holds at most 15 files; folding the client in keeps the
//! entry count under that ceiling (see xtask mkinitrd).
//!
//! # Capability contract (when entered as the client)
//! - slot 0: the report endpoint (WRITE)
//! - slot 1: the `Stack` endpoint (WRITE)
//! - slot 2: an untyped budget (to mint and map the shared frame)
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `netcli`. Refused `netcli` (squished)
//! and `socket_client`, which belongs to the real clients milestone 54 will need. This file is a
//! single-consumer `#[path]` module rather than a `[[bin]]`.
