//! **`uuid`**: print a version-4 UUID drawn from the entropy service (milestone 111, DECISIONS §44,
//! notes/entropy.md).
//!
//! The whole program is: ask the entropy service for sixteen bytes, stamp the six bits RFC 9562
//! reserves, print the canonical form. It holds two capabilities and neither of them can reach the
//! random device, exactly `date`'s shape one manifest field over
//! ([`grant_plan::Manifest::entropy`] rather than `Manifest::clock`).
//!
//! # Why this program exists, and why it is not a demonstration
//!
//! Milestone 56 built the entropy service and the grant that reaches it, and nothing at the prompt
//! could pass that grant on: a program needing randomness worked when the *system* spawned it
//! (`credentialer` at boot, `disk_partitioner` under the kernel's own test harness) and could not
//! be run by a person. `date` before `user/src/date.rs` existed is the position that left; this is
//! that milestone's `date`.
//!
//! It is **`disk_partitioner`'s draw with the disk taken away**. Both call
//! `gpt::guid::Guid::v4_from_random` over sixteen bytes from the same service, because a GPT gives
//! every partition a random globally unique id and `crates/gpt` refuses to invent one. The
//! partitioner also needs a disk capability, which this shell does not hold and cannot attenuate;
//! the sixteen bytes and the stamping are the half that a prompt can reach today.
//!
//! # The capability table
//!
//! | slot | what | why it is that and not wider |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | the output sink, `WRITE` | where the identifier goes |
//! | 8 | the diagnostics sink, `WRITE` | where the refusal goes, so `>` cannot swallow it |
//! | 9 | the entropy service, `WRITE` | the right to `CALL` it, and nothing else |
//!
//! `WRITE` on slot 9 is the whole grant. `READ` would let this program `RECV` on the service's own
//! request endpoint, which is to take another client's request out from under it; `GRANT` would let
//! it hand a random source to something it spawned. Neither is given, and neither is needed.
//!
//! # The refusal is the interesting half
//!
//! A program spawned without [`grant_plan::Manifest::entropy`] holds an empty slot 9. Its first
//! `CALL` comes back as `abi::Error::NoSuchSlot`, which `entropy_proto::delivered` reports as
//! `None` rather than as a short reply, and this program then prints **nothing at all** and says
//! why on its second stream.
//!
//! That is deliberate and it is why the manifest declares `OutputSpec::BytesAndDiagnostics`. A
//! `uuid > id.txt` on a boot with no entropy service must leave the file empty, because a file
//! containing a predictable identifier is worse than a file containing nothing: the first is wrong
//! and looks right. There is no counter fallback here for the same reason `disk_partitioner` has
//! none (its `R_NO_ENTROPY`), and the same reason `crates/gpt` will not invent a GUID.
//!
//! # Arguments: none
//!
//! There is no argv on this ABI (notes/abi.md) and this program needs none. Unix's `uuidgen` takes
//! a version selector; there is one version here, and a count would want a positional argument
//! `ArgSpec` cannot carry yet (the same gap `printenv`'s and `date`'s module docs name).
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//! uuid                     A4E1B0C7-2F3D-4A81-9C6E-5B7D0F2A1E44
//! uuid > id.txt            (the identifier is in the file, nothing on the terminal)
//! uuid  (no entropy)       uuid: no entropy capability was granted; nothing was generated
//! caps uuid                cap 9  endpoint  entropy  WRITE. it may ask the entropy service ...
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **One identifier per invocation.** `uuidgen -n 10` has no spelling here, because `ArgSpec` has
//!   no positional argument yet. Ten invocations are ten spawns.
//! - **Version 4 only.** No name-based (v3/v5) or time-based (v1/v7) form, which would need a
//!   hash and a clock this program does not hold. A v7 would be worth having once something wants
//!   sortable identifiers; nothing does.
//! - **"Unpredictable" is a claim about the boot, not about this program.** The bytes are whatever
//!   the entropy service delivers, and on QEMU that is a virtio-rng backed by the host
//!   (DECISIONS §120's stopgap). Whether a real board's TRNG is sound is
//!   `notes/entropy.md`'s open question and endowing a grant does not settle it.
//! - **A short draw is treated as a failure.** `entropy_proto` delivers at most eight bytes a round
//!   trip and this program needs sixteen, so it makes two calls and refuses if either answers with
//!   fewer than eight. It does not retry. `disk_partitioner::random16` makes exactly the same call.
//!
//! Name: provisional, introduced 2026-09-05 alongside `grant_plan::Manifest::entropy`. RFC 9562's
//! own term for the object, and a term of art already right per this tree's own naming convention
//! for standard terms. Refused `uuidgen` (Unix's name for the *tool*, but that name carries an
//! argument surface this ABI cannot deliver, so it would promise a program this is not) and `guid`
//! (`crates/gpt` calls the same sixteen bytes a `Guid` because GPT's spec does, but the spec is
//! Microsoft's spelling of the same object and the wider word is the one a reader arrives with).
//! Unrated by calef.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and documenting an
// OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
