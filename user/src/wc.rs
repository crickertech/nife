//! **`wc`: the consumer** (milestone 50, notes/pipes.md).
//!
//! It counts lines, words and bytes on its input and writes the three numbers to its output. Both
//! ends are the sink contract (`crates/byte_sink_proto`), which is the entire reason this program is
//! worth having: it is the first thing in the tree that **reads** a stream, and it reads it with
//! the same sixteen-byte framing that `date` and every `println!` write.
//!
//! # It cannot tell what is feeding it, and that is the demonstration
//!
//! Slot 1 holds an endpoint with `READ`. Sink messages arrive on it until [`byte_sink_proto::OP_EOF`].
//! Behind that endpoint there is either another program (`date | wc`), a file the shell opened and
//! streamed (`wc < report.txt`, and `wc report.txt`, which is the same thing with the operator left
//! out), or the shell itself typing bytes into it (`echo hello | wc`). There is no message this
//! program can send to ask which, no field in a message that says, and no capability in its capability table
//! that names anything but the two endpoints. **The same binary, three sources, one behaviour.**
//!
//! `wc report.txt` is worth a second look for exactly that reason. It reads like Unix's `wc`, where
//! naming a file means the program `open()`s it with your whole authority; here the name is a
//! designation the *shell* resolves, and what arrives is bytes. A `wc` that opened the file it
//! counts would be a `wc` that could open any file.
//!
//! The output side is the same claim, already made by `std_exerciser` in the protocol lane: slot 0 holds
//! an endpoint with `WRITE`, and whether the shell prints the answer or a file records it is not
//! something this program participates in.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//!
//! | slot | what | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | the output sink, `WRITE` | where the three numbers go |
//! | 1 | the input source, `READ` | where the bytes come from |
//!
//! Two capabilities, no memory grant, no file, no directory, no shared page. A `wc` that could open
//! the file it counts would be a `wc` that could open any file; this one is handed the bytes.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//! $ echo the quick brown fox | wc
//!   1 4 20
//! $ date | wc
//!   1 5 29
//! $ wc < report.txt
//!   12 84 511
//! $ wc report.txt
//!   12 84 511
//! $ wc
//!   wc: reads an input stream: name a file, redirect with '<', or pipe into it
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **No `-l`, `-w` or `-c`.** Unix's `wc` prints a subset chosen by options; this one prints all
//!   three, because selecting among them is formatting and the pipeline is where formatting
//!   belongs. When there is something to select *with*, the selection is a program downstream.
//! - **A word is a run of non-whitespace**, which is Unix's definition and is wrong for text that
//!   is not ASCII. There is no locale here to be wrong about, so the definition is at least honest.
//! - **It counts what it is given.** A line with no trailing newline still counts as a line, which
//!   differs from Unix's `wc -l` (that counts newlines). The number this prints is the number of
//!   lines a person would count.
//! - **One name, and it cannot count two files or print a total.** `wc a.txt b.txt` is refused at
//!   the prompt as an operand with nowhere to go, because a manifest here declares one input and a
//!   second would need positional arity the shell does not have yet. Unix prints a per-file table
//!   and a total; that is formatting over a set, and this program counts one stream.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-07-31, and it is the program that settled a naming rule
//! without ever being named by one. The tenet's rejected two-tier draft (short names for typed
//! commands, underscores for spawned programs) was refused because the category is not stable, and
//! `wc` is the proof: it was internal plumbing and became a prompt-typed pipeline stage inside a
//! day.
