//! **`printenv`**: print the inert-configuration page (milestone 47's environment-variable fork,
//! DECISIONS §111, notes/env-config.md).
//!
//! The whole program is: read a page, print what it carries. It holds two capabilities and
//! neither of them can change anything, exactly `date`'s shape one manifest field over
//! ([`grant_plan::Manifest::config`] rather than [`grant_plan::Manifest::clock`]).
//!
//! # It reads. There is no way to set anything from here.
//!
//! The page this program maps is `READ`-only, and that rung is the whole of why there is no
//! `printenv -s TZ=...` here: the authority this process lacks is a page permission rather than a
//! check somewhere in this file. Nothing about what a shell hands its own children can be changed
//! by a program spawned with a config grant, which is the same shape `date` already demonstrates
//! for the clock.
//!
//! # Three keys, three closed domains, and a state the type carries honestly
//!
//! `environment_proto::ConfigPage` answers `Option<&str>` per key: `Some(value)` when the page is
//! valid and carries that key, `None` when the page is valid but that key was never set, and
//! (indistinguishably from the outside, by design) `None` when nobody assembled a page into this
//! frame at all. This program tells the second case apart from the first two the same way `date`
//! tells "no clock service" from "no clock capability": by checking whether it holds the
//! capability at all before it prints anything about what the page says.
//!
//! # Arguments: none
//!
//! There is no argv on this ABI (notes/abi.md), and this program needs none: `printenv` with no
//! arguments is the only spelling, matching Unix's own `printenv(1)`/`env(1)` with nothing to
//! filter by.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//! printenv                  TZ=UTC
//!                            LANG=C
//!                            TERM=dumb
//! printenv  (a key unset)   TZ=UTC
//!                            LANG (unset)
//!                            TERM=dumb
//! printenv  (no grant)      printenv: no configuration was granted
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **No filtering.** Unix's `printenv NAME` prints one variable; this always prints all three,
//!   because `ArgSpec` has no position yet (the same gap `date`'s module docs name for a format
//!   selector) and three lines cost nothing to read in full.
//! - **The three keys are hardcoded.** Nothing here enumerates the page; a fourth validated domain
//!   would need a fourth line written by hand. `environment_proto::PAGE_BYTES` is small and fixed,
//!   so this is a property of the contract rather than an oversight, but a reader expecting a
//!   generic env dump should know the shape is closed.
//!
//! Name: provisional, introduced 2026-08-26 alongside `grant_plan::Manifest::config`. Unix's
//! own name for exactly this (`printenv(1)`), a term of art already right per this tree's own
//! naming convention for standard terms; unrated by calef.
