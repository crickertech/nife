//! **A provisioning tool: create an identity and its home subtree together** (milestone 155,
//! design/roadmap/155-user-provisioning.md; DECISIONS §117).
//!
//! Unix's `useradd`, one level down: this process is spawned once per new identity by whoever
//! already holds the two administrative capabilities that authority requires, presents the
//! identity and secret it was handed, and does two things as one act rather than two: `PUT`s them
//! into the credential store over [`credential_proto::provision::PUT`], and `MKDIR`s that identity's home
//! subtree, named by the identity string itself (DECISIONS §117), under whatever directory
//! capability holds the principal tree.
//!
//! # Who may run this, and how (the milestone's own first question)
//!
//! **Answered by precedent, not invented here.** This tree's whole model is that authority is a
//! capability held, never a checked identity: `credentialer.rs`'s provision endpoint has no
//! authentication of its own, because by the time a caller holds it there is nothing left to check
//! (the receive end that would refuse anybody is the one thing the seal deletes). This process
//! follows the same shape. It performs **no authentication of its caller** and needs none: "who may
//! run this tool" is answered completely by "whoever is handed [`PROV`] and [`FS_EP`] at spawn",
//! exactly as `login.rs`'s BUGS name "who is granted these capabilities" as a boot-wiring question
//! rather than a runtime check, and exactly as `credentialer_test_client.rs`'s provisioner role is
//! trusted by construction rather than by a password. A real deployment's answer to "how does an
//! operator come to hold these two capabilities" is the same open question `login.rs`'s BUGS already
//! name for "not wired into the interactive boot": real work this slice does not attempt.
//!
//! # Ordering: the subtree first, and why
//!
//! **These are two independent calls to two different servers, not one transaction**, and this
//! system has no cross-server commit protocol to make them one (building one would be a real
//! architectural undertaking, not a detail of this tool). So a failure between them is possible, and
//! the milestone's own text asks which partial state is acceptable.
//!
//! **The subtree is created first.** If [`filesystem_proto::fs::MKDIR`] fails, nothing has been written to
//! the credential store: the failure is a clean no-op, and the caller can simply try again. If the
//! subtree succeeds but [`credential_proto::provision::PUT`] then fails (the store is
//! [`credential_proto::FULL`], the store has [`credential_proto::NO_ENTROPY`] to draw a salt from, or the
//! identity is already there), the result is an **orphaned, empty subtree with no live identity**.
//! That is the safe direction: nobody can authenticate as an identity whose credential was never
//! stored, so the orphaned subtree is inert, and it is recoverable by re-running this tool (see
//! below). The alternative order risks the opposite state, a credential that verifies for an
//! identity with no home, which is dangerous rather than merely untidy: once a caller wires
//! per-identity subtree lookup (DECISIONS §117's own follow-on), a login against that identity would
//! authenticate and then have nowhere defined to go. This tree's standing posture is to refuse
//! toward safety on every ambiguity it can (`credential_proto::NO_ENTROPY` over a weak salt,
//! [`credential_proto::MISMATCH`] over a distinguishable miss); this ordering is that same posture applied
//! to a two-step provisioning act.
//!
//! **A pre-existing subtree is not treated as failure.** `MKDIR` answers [`EEXIST`] when the name is
//! already there (`filesystem_proto::fs::MKDIR`'s own contract; "create is create, not create-or-open"), and
//! this process treats that one errno as "already created, proceed" rather than as a refusal: it is
//! exactly the state a previous, partially-failed run would leave, and re-running this tool is the
//! prescribed recovery. Every other `MKDIR` failure ([`filesystem_proto::dir::EPERM`], a name that does not
//! fit, no `CREATE` right on the parent) stops the request before the credential store is touched
//! at all.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//!
//! - slot [`PROV`]: `WRITE` on the credential service's provision endpoint
//!   (`user/src/credentialer.rs`), before its seal. Never the verify endpoint; this process could
//!   not authenticate anybody even by mistake, because it never holds that capability.
//! - slot [`FS_EP`]: `WRITE` on the directory capability that holds the principal tree. Unnarrowed
//!   in this slice's own wiring, the same "not wired into the interactive boot" bound `login.rs`
//!   names for its own fixed subtree grant: a real deployment scopes this to a dedicated parent
//!   directory once one exists, which is follow-on and not guessed at here.
//! - slot [`REPORT`]: `WRITE`. One report, then this process exits; it does not loop.
//! - mapped [`REQ_VA`]: the page the caller (kernel test harness today; a real operator's shell,
//!   eventually) stages the identity and secret into, in [`credential_proto::place`]'s exact layout. This
//!   process never chooses this content; it only relays it.
//! - mapped [`PROV_VA`]: the page shared with the credential service, at the address
//!   `user/src/credentialer.rs`'s own `PROV_VA` names. Must be the same physical frame; the wiring
//!   guarantees this the way `login_service.rs` guarantees it for `CRED_VA`.
//! - mapped [`FS_VA`]: the page shared with the file service, for the one `MKDIR` request.
//! - `a0`: the identity's length in [`REQ_VA`]. `a1`: the secret's length. Both bounded the way
//!   [`credential_proto::read`] bounds them; a length outside that range is refused before anything is
//!   sent anywhere.
//!
//! # What this does not do (see the milestone's own "what it does not decide")
//!
//! No [`credential_proto::provision::SEAL`]. Sealing ends provisioning for the *whole store*, forever, and
//! is a decision an operator makes once after every identity it wants is in, not a thing one
//! identity's provisioning should trigger as a side effect. This tool's caller seals when it is
//! done, exactly as `credentialer_test_client.rs`'s provisioner role already does in its own tests.
//!
//! No deprovisioning. Named as out of scope by the milestone's own text and sequenced against
//! `login.rs`'s reclamation bound instead of invented here.
//!
//! Name: provisional, minted with this milestone and not yet put to calef. `identity_provisioner`
//! rather than `provisioner` (already spent, as a role name inside `credentialer_test_client.rs`) or
//! `useradd` (Unix's own name for the shape, not a term of art this tree has adopted elsewhere).
