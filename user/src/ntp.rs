//! **The NTP client, and the test server that answers it** (milestone 51; DECISIONS §43 and §44,
//! notes/ntp.md).
//!
//! The component that turns `ntp_proto`'s wire format into an actual clock correction. It holds a
//! **network capability** and a capability to **propose** a time. It does not hold the clock.
//!
//! # The endowment is the argument
//!
//! ```text
//!   entropy ──an endpoint──►┌──────────────┐──an endpoint──► net_stack ──► the network
//!   (8 random bytes,        │  ntp client  │ (the socket contract, UDP 123)
//!    the nonce)             └──────┬───────┘
//!                                  │ an endpoint: PROPOSE
//!                          ┌───────▼────────┐
//!                          │ clock service  │──writes──► the clock page
//!                          └────────────────┘   (this process holds NO mapping of it,
//!                                                read-only or otherwise)
//! ```
//!
//! Five slots, and the interesting one is the slot that is missing. There is no clock page here,
//! writable or not, so "set the time" is not an operation this process can express: the only thing
//! it can do with the wall clock is ask, and `clock_proto::policy` answers. **A compromised NTP
//! client can lie inside the service's bounds and can do nothing else.** In Unix `ntpd` runs as root
//! and may set the clock to anything at all. `an_ntp_client_holds_no_writable_clock_page` in
//! `kernel/src/user.rs` proves the claim the way the machine proves things: the same binary, given
//! the same five slots plus the address at which a *setter* maps the clock page, writes there and
//! dies of a fault.
//!
//! # The nonce comes from the entropy service, or the client stops
//!
//! `Query::with_nonce` exists because a server never interprets the client's transmit timestamp; it
//! copies it into the origin field and does nothing else. So 64 random bits on the wire, with the
//! true send time kept locally, take an off-path attacker from about twelve bits of guesswork to
//! sixty-four (notes/ntp.md).
//!
//! That is worth exactly as much as the bits are unguessable, and until 2026-07-30 the only source
//! here was splitmix64 seeded off the virtual counter, which notes/entropy.md calls "predictable to
//! anyone who could guess boot-relative time". So the nonce is drawn from the entropy service
//! (DECISIONS §44), and a client with no entropy capability **refuses to send anything**: it reports
//! [`RPT_NO_ENTROPY`] and exits. Falling back to the weak stream would be §42's silent degradation
//! in the one place where the whole point of the value is that nobody can predict it, and it is the
//! same call `SystemRng` makes when it panics rather than degrading.
//!
//! # One shot, because there is no timed wait
//!
//! The kernel's syscall surface is `EXIT`, `YIELD`, `INVOKE`, `CAP_DELETE`. There is no sleep, no
//! timeout, and no deadline anywhere in it (the milestone 51 block's open fork), so a poll interval
//! is a yield-spin: a thread that stays runnable for the whole interval and costs scheduler work in
//! proportion to it. At NTP's ordinary 64-second poll that is not a service anybody should ship, so
//! this is a **one-shot synchroniser**: up to [`ATTEMPTS`] requests a few milliseconds apart, one
//! proposal, exit. A long-running client is the timed-wait fork's to build, not a workaround to
//! invent here.
//!
//! **A kiss-o'-death is not retried.** Stratum 0 is an instruction rather than a time (`RATE` means
//! back off, `DENY` means go away), and a client that retries into one is the abusive client the
//! packet exists to stop.
//!
//! # Roles
//!
//! One binary, three roles selected by `arg0`, which is how every other multi-part program here is
//! packed and keeps the initrd's directory small:
//!
//! | role | what it is | `arg1` | `arg2` |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`ROLE_CLIENT`] | the client above | the server's IPv4, packed big-endian | the server's UDP port |
//! | [`ROLE_SERVER`] | the test server (below) | one of the `SRV_*` variants | the wall-clock nanoseconds it claims |
//! | [`ROLE_PROBE_CLOCK`] | the client's endowment, pointed at the clock page | the address to write | unused |
//!
//! # The test server, and what it does and does not prove
//!
//! [`ROLE_SERVER`] is **both an NTP server and the network**: it holds `READ` on an endpoint the
//! client was given `WRITE` on, and it speaks the same socket contract (`crates/socket_proto/src/lib.rs`)
//! `net_stack` does. The client cannot tell, and that is the point rather than a convenience: the
//! client's network path is one endpoint capability, so substituting the peer at that boundary runs
//! the client's **real, unmodified code**. There is no test-only branch anywhere in the client.
//!
//! What that proves: the socket-contract glue (minting a frame, delegating it, the destination
//! header, `SENDTO`/`RECV` framing), that the 48 bytes on the wire are a well-formed NTPv4 client
//! packet addressed to port 123, that the nonce is unpredictable, that a reply failing
//! `Query::accept` moves nothing, and that an accepted sample becomes a *proposal* the clock service
//! judges.
//!
//! What it does not prove: that smoltcp, UDP, IPv4 and the NIC carry those bytes. Milestone 30's
//! socket-contract tests prove that path with a real datagram, and this lane deliberately does not
//! re-prove it. Nor does it prove anything about a real internet time server: nothing in QEMU's
//! slirp answers UDP 123, and pointing the gate at a public server would make it depend on somebody
//! else's network. The honest summary is that the client is proven against a server we wrote, over a
//! network we wrote, and the parts we did not write are proven elsewhere.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-07-31 with milestone 55; the protocol's own name, which would
//! put it in the tenet's protected group had anyone filed it there.
