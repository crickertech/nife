//! The capability shell, at EL0: designation is authorization (milestone 31, phase 1).
//!
//! Milestone 10 gave this program a command line; milestone 31 gives that command line a meaning it
//! does not have on Unix. A Unix child inherits your whole authority and then `open()`s whatever its
//! uid allows. Here the command line is a **grant expression**: naming a resource in a command is
//! how you grant it, and a program that names nothing gets nothing beyond the report channel every
//! spawn carries. There is no ambient authority to fall back on, so when a program needs something
//! the command did not grant, the refusal reads "you hold no such capability", not a Unix-flavored
//! EPERM. The parsing and the manifest checking are the host-tested `grant_plan` crate; this file is the
//! wiring that turns a checked grant into real, delegated capabilities.
//!
//! What the shell can grant, it grants from what it *holds*. The headline is `prog --mem N`, which
//! endows a program N pages of untyped **split from the shell's own budget** (slot 3) and delegated
//! to it. A bare name in a file position is the second, and whether it can be backed is a statement
//! about this shell's capability table rather than about the calendar: a shell whose init granted it a
//! directory (slot [`DIR_TERMINAL`]) resolves the name, and one granted none says "you hold no such
//! capability". Milestone 50 made the first case real at the interactive prompt; see [`holdings`],
//! notes/pipes.md and notes/grant-expression.md. `caps` prints the shell's whole endowment, and
//! `caps <command>` previews exactly what that command would grant, making DECISIONS §14's "reading
//! one literal tells you a process's whole authority" interactively true.
//!
//! **The clock is the one authority in a preview that no token designates** (milestone 51's wiring).
//! `date` declares it in its manifest and *init* endows it, read-only; `caps date` prints it anyway,
//! because a preview that showed only what the line designates would be off by exactly one
//! capability.
//!
//! **Since milestone 86 this shell holds a clock of its own**, at the slot init names in `x2`, and it
//! is `READ` **without** `GRANT`. That one bit is the whole design of `time <command>`: the shell can
//! read the wall clock to measure a command, and it cannot hand a clock to anything it spawns, so the
//! set of processes that can read the time is still decided by the manifests init reads (DECISIONS
//! §43). Timing is something an observer does with its own authority; the thing being timed needs
//! nothing and is not told. See notes/time-command.md.
//!
//! # The grammar lost two words in milestone 47
//!
//! There is no `run` verb: a bare program name spawns it, so builtins and programs are typed the
//! same way and nobody has to know which class a command is in. And there is no `file:` prefix: a
//! bare token in a file position designates the file, because the direction (the half that matters)
//! was always the manifest's to declare and the prefix only marked the half already on the screen.
//! `caps` is the visibility surface that remains, which is an argument for keeping it good.
//!
//! # The shell's world
//!
//! It holds, by convention (init granted them in this order):
//!
//! - slot 0: the terminal rendezvous (CALL: `OP_WRITE` / `OP_READLINE`).
//! - slot 1: a spawn rendezvous (direct init to start a program; `grant_plan::spawnproto`).
//! - slot 2: a result rendezvous (receive a spawned program's answer).
//! - slot 3: an untyped budget, the memory it grants with `--mem`.
//!
//! and two pages shared with the terminal: `OUT_VA` (we write text and prompts) and `LINE_VA`
//! (completed lines arrive). No role selector; the syscall runtime comes from `user_rt`.
//!
//! Two more slots are **wiring-dependent** and their numbers are therefore not constants here: the
//! directory ([`DIR_TERMINAL`], slot 4, when this boot has a filesystem) and the clock page, whose
//! slot arrives in `x2` because it sits after the filesystem pair and a boot with no disk has one
//! fewer capability under it. See [`CLOCK_SLOT`].
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `shell`. Refused `shell` (a category
//! rather than a name: `bash`, `zsh`, `fish` and `rc` are identities), `capsh` (Linux's libcap
//! ships `capsh(1)`, a capability shell wrapper, so a reader from Linux would assume ours is that
//! tool) and `sheesh` (it carries a 2020-21 timestamp where `bash` and `fish` are era-neutral, and
//! it is an interjection of exasperation, while refusing things is this shell's most characteristic
//! behaviour by design). A swish is the shot that goes through the net touching nothing, which is
//! least authority in one word.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **A spawned command that traps hangs the prompt** (measured 2026-09-02, milestone 233). This
//! shell waits on the job's result endpoint, and a thread the kernel killed never sends on it, so
//! the wait has nothing to wake it and the prompt does not come back. Measured rather than
//! reasoned about: `user/src/worker.rs` was patched to `supervision_proto::fail()` on one argument
//! and `script/shell-check` run against it, which failed with both the kernel's own report of the
//! killed thread and "the prompt never came back to take `worker 6`".
//!
//! An ordinary non-zero exit is fine and is not this case: `worker` with no argument sets a status
//! and `echo $?` reads it, which `script/shell-check` already asserts. It is specifically a *fault*
//! that leaves the wait outstanding.
//!
//! The pieces to fix it exist and are not wired to each other. Init already runs a supervisor
//! (`job_undertaker`, and the fault endpoint every child is born holding, DECISIONS §26), so the
//! death is observed; nothing carries that observation back to whoever is waiting on the job's
//! result. What that should look like at the prompt is a design question rather than a wiring one:
//! a shell that printed a status for a faulted job would need a word for it that
//! `grant_plan::spawnproto` does not currently have.
