//!   MODE_DIRECT (milestone 177, option A: the boot's single-terminal case):
//!   virtio-input ──virtio──► kbd ──OP_BYTES, one CALL──► line_editor
//! ```
//!
//! # Two modes, chosen at spawn, the same shape `display_terminal`'s `MODE_DISPLAY`/`MODE_WINDOW`
//! # split already uses
//!
//! [`MODE_RING`] is rung two's: the driver publishes bytes into a page the compositor maps and
//! rings a content-free doorbell, so a compositor arbitrating between several windows decides who
//! actually sees them (DECISIONS §33). [`MODE_DIRECT`] is milestone 177's: for a boot with exactly
//! one terminal, there is no second window to misdirect a keystroke to, so the problem the
//! compositor's focus arbitration solves does not exist in this journey's scope
//! (design/roadmap/177-graphical-interactive-boot.md's own reasoning). The driver instead holds a
//! fixed `CALL` capability to `line_editor`'s own served endpoint, granted at spawn, and sends
//! every keystroke there directly, byte for byte the same [`line_editor::proto::OP_BYTES`] framing
//! `user/src/input.rs`'s UART driver already uses to feed the very same endpoint. **Not** a
//! security exception to the module note below: it is *narrower* authority than [`MODE_RING`], not
//! looser, because this driver holds exactly one fixed capability instead of "whichever client the
//! compositor currently focuses."
//!
//! Its whole authority, and the shape of it is the point:
//!
//! - slot 0, a **report** endpoint: how it tells its spawner it came up;
//! - slot 1, an **`Irq`**: the device's event interrupt;
//! - slot 2, a **`Virtio`**: the confined transport, and the only way it can reach the device;
//! - slot 3, **[`OUT`]**: the compositor's doorbell (WRITE) in [`MODE_RING`], `line_editor`'s served
//!   endpoint (WRITE) in [`MODE_DIRECT`] -- one slot, two meanings, chosen by `arg0` exactly as
//!   `display_terminal`'s `PRESENT` slot is;
//! - mapped: its own DMA page, and in [`MODE_RING`] only, the **input ring** it shares with the
//!   compositor and nobody else.
//!
//! # Why the ring is the authority, and the doorbell is not (`MODE_RING`)
//!
//! DECISIONS §33's central idea, from the producing side. This driver's power to inject a keystroke
//! is the **mapping of the input ring**, which no client has. It is not the doorbell: every client
//! holds that, and everything sent on it is content-free, so a client that rang it a thousand times
//! could not type a single character. A keystroke carried in a message word would have been
//! forgeable by any client; a keystroke in a page nobody else maps cannot be forged at all.
//!
//! So this driver is *not* trusted with the compositor's policy and holds no client's endpoint. It
//! cannot choose who receives what it types: focus is the compositor's decision, expressed as which
//! of the input endpoints *it* holds it uses. This program cannot name a client at all -- **in
//! [`MODE_RING`]**. [`MODE_DIRECT`] names exactly one, fixed at spawn by whoever built this process,
//! never by the driver's own choice, which is the same authority `user/src/input.rs` has always had
//! for the plain UART case.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! No key repeat of its own (the device sends repeats and [`video_terminal::keymap`] honours them), no LEDs, no
//! layout switching, no mouse or tablet (a `virtio-tablet-pci` presents the same PCI id, which is
//! recorded in `crates/pci` rather than guessed at), and no configuration-space query: it drives the
//! event queue and nothing else. The honest limits are in notes/glyphs.md.
//!
//! Name: provisional, corrected 2026-08-27. An earlier version of this comment claimed `kbd` was
//! ratified 2026-07-30 alongside DECISIONS §39; checked directly against that section's own text
//! and found false: §39 names `blk`, `spawner`, `console`, `input`, `shell`, `painter` and
//! `window` as the names already right, and `kbd` is not among them. calef, 2026-08-27: he is not
//! a fan of `kbd` for "keyboard" and this naming has not happened yet. Corrected here rather than
//! left standing, per this project's own rule that a false name-claim is the same defect as a
//! stale comment.
