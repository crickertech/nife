//! **The operator: replace a running component under a talking client** (milestone 23,
//! DECISIONS §41).
//!
//! This is the milestone's flagship, and it is an unprivileged process. The kernel does not know a
//! swap is happening, has no notion of a component, and gained no method for one. What it supplies
//! is what it already supplied: endpoints that name no peer (§12), a death message (§26), a reap
//! that needs no construction authority (§32), and revocation (§13, §16, and §41's device
//! take-back). Everything else is code here.
//!
//! # Three roles: two rungs of the latency ladder, and one component that stops answering
//!
//! - [`ROLE_DIRECT`](swap_proto::ROLE_DIRECT): the default rung. The stable name a client holds is the
//!   endpoint object itself, and the swap changes who is parked in `RECV_CAP` on it. **No process
//!   sits in the data path**, so the steady state costs exactly what an unbrokered call costs.
//! - [`ROLE_QUEUED`](swap_proto::ROLE_QUEUED): the opt-in rung. A `broker` stands between producer and
//!   backend so the producer never blocks on an absent consumer. One extra hop, priced by the
//!   `broker_rtt` benchmark, and chosen per channel rather than imposed on every IPC.
//! - [`ROLE_HUNG`](swap_proto::ROLE_HUNG): the same system as the direct rung, against an incumbent
//!   that **stops answering without dying** (milestone 23's third residual). Step 2 of the four is
//!   unavailable, because draining needs the incumbent's cooperation and that is exactly what is
//!   missing; the interesting result is that the other three steps do not. See
//!   notes/hung-component.md, and read its two open decisions before extending this role.
//!
//! # The direct swap, step by step, and why the order is this
//!
//! ```text
//!   1 BUILT    lay the replacement out, endow it, retype its TCB -- but do NOT configure or start
//!              it. A thread that has never been started is in nobody's queue, so it cannot take a
//!              request the incumbent is still there to serve.
//!   2 DRAINED  CALL OP_QUIESCE on the service endpoint itself. The endpoint's sender queue is
//!              FIFO, so by the time this arrives the incumbent has answered every request queued
//!              ahead of it. It replies and stops receiving.
//!   3 REVOKED  PageFrame::REVOKE the device capability: gone from every holder but us.
//!   4 STARTED  map the registers into the replacement, CONFIGURE, START. The down window ends.
//!   5 REAPED   the incumbent is told to touch the device it no longer has; it faults, its death
//!              arrives on the supervision endpoint, and Rendezvous::REAP collects the corpse.
//! ```
//!
//! **The roadmap put "start the new server" first and the revoke second, and building it that way
//! does not work.** §13 revocation is by *physical page*: a revoke that ran after the replacement
//! had been endowed with the device would take the replacement's copy too, and since the kernel
//! mints a device capability once, at boot, nothing could ever hand one back. So the replacement is
//! built and endowed with everything *except* the device, and receives the registers on the far
//! side of the revoke. What had to move is the endowment, not the build, which is why the down
//! window is still four syscalls wide. Recorded rather than quietly reordered.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-07-30 (calef, DECISIONS §39, landed by milestone 46), replacing `swapd`.
//! Refused `swapd` (the `-d` claim).
