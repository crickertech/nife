//! **The subtree caretaker: a directory capability attenuated to one subtree** (milestone 47,
//! notes/dir-capability.md).
//!
//! `fs_file_caretaker` narrows a directory capability to one *file*. This narrows it to one
//! *subtree*, which is the shape `cd`, a per-process namespace, and every "here is somewhere to
//! write your logs" grant actually want. It is the same caretaker pattern (Mark Miller's term): it
//! holds the wider capability, exports a narrower one, and is the only path between them.
//!
//! **Subtree, not directory, and the name now says which.** The old name said "directory", and that
//! distinguished nothing: all three filesystem caretakers *hold* a directory capability. What this
//! one serves is the directory **and everything beneath it**, reached through the handle the FS
//! server minted, so `fs_subtree` is what a reader should predict from the name.
//!
//! # It performs no checks, and that is the design
//!
//! `fs_file_caretaker` has to inspect requests, because a file capability and a directory
//! capability speak different protocols and it is translating between them. This one does not. At
//! startup it sends **one** [`fs::OPENDIR`], which asks the FS server for a handle to the granted
//! name carrying the granted rights; the server intersects those rights with its own and refuses if
//! the answer came up short. Everything the client can reach afterwards is reached *through that
//! handle*, so the attenuation lives in the handle the server minted and not in any branch here.
//!
//! What this process actually does is **translate a namespace**. The client numbers handles in its
//! own space starting at [`filesystem_proto::fs::ROOT`], which is the granted directory; this maps each one
//! to the FS server's number and forwards. A client that guesses a handle is guessing in a table
//! with a handful of inhabitants, none of which it chose, and a handle this process never minted is
//! `EBADF` from one check.
//!
//! Two consequences worth stating, because they are what the confinement rests on:
//!
//! - **The confined program holds an endpoint to this process and nothing that names the FS
//!   server**, so "it cannot reach the parent directory" is a property of its cspace rather than of
//!   a branch it is trusted to take. The boundary is an address space, which is why
//!   `fs_file_caretaker`'s tests are witnesses and not assertions, and why this one's are too.
//! - **A rights-carrying handle alone would not confine it.** The FS server's handle table is per
//!   server, not per client, so a program holding the FS-service endpoint could always name
//!   [`filesystem_proto::fs::ROOT`] and be back at the image root. The handle is the authority; the endpoint
//!   is the boundary. That is the whole argument for this process existing.
//!
//! # Capability contract (`kernel/src/user/fs_service.rs`, `start_granted_dir`)
//!
//! - **slot 0**: the FS-service endpoint, `WRITE`. The directory capability being attenuated.
//! - **slot 1**: the narrowed endpoint, `READ`. The confined program `CALL`s here; this endpoint IS
//!   the subtree capability.
//! - **slot 2**: a report endpoint, `WRITE`. Readiness ([`filesystem_proto::fixture::READY`]) once the
//!   descent has succeeded, or [`filesystem_proto::fixture::DESCENT_REFUSED`] with the errno if it did not,
//!   after which this process exits without serving.
//! - **[`PAGE_VA`]**: the page shared with the FS server *and* with the client, one frame for all
//!   three, sound for the reason `fs_file_caretaker`'s note gives: every request on both hops is a
//!   blocking `CALL`, so the client is parked inside its own call for the whole time this process
//!   is using the page.
//!
//! The granted name and the requested rights arrive in the three `START` argument words
//! ([`filesystem_proto::grant`], whose spec word carries a rights mask of any width), so a subtree grant
//! costs no extra frame.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 61), replacing `dwarden`, which is the name that
//! made the case for the whole naming tenet: it was named for what it **holds** while both siblings
//! are named for what they **serve**, and all three hold a directory, so the old name distinguished
//! nothing. Refused `dwarden`, the `warden` family, and bare `subtree`, because subtree already
//! means three things here (the supervision tree, this repository, and git's own `subtree`);
//! carrying the disambiguation in the name beats carrying it in the doc comment.
