//! **A window: a client of the compositor** (milestone 33, the display ladder's rung two).
//!
//! One program, several roles, because the roles differ by one act each and sharing the honest path
//! is what makes an attack a fair test rather than a different program failing for its own reasons
//! (the same reason `display` carries its own escape role).
//!
//! What an honest window holds:
//!
//! - slot 0, a **report** endpoint: its verdict goes to whoever spawned it;
//! - slot 1, the **doorbell** (WRITE): where it rings the compositor;
//! - slot 2, an **input** endpoint (READ), *only if it was granted one*. Holding this is what makes a
//!   client eligible for focus; a client without it cannot be sent a keystroke by anyone, and its
//!   attempt to receive on that slot is refused by the kernel with `NoSuchSlot`;
//! - a **control page** and a **surface**: its own geometry, its own damage rectangle, its own pixels.
//!
//! And that is all. It cannot name another client, another surface, or the screen. There is no window
//! id in any request it can make (the protocol takes none), so there is nothing to forge; and the
//! pixels of its neighbours are not in its address space, so there is nothing to reach.
//!
//! # What the roles prove
//!
//! - [`ROLE_PROBE_INPUT`]: asks the kernel to receive on the input slot it was **not** granted. The
//!   refusal is `abi::Error::NoSuchSlot` (-1), "there is nothing there", which is what
//!   no-ambient-authority reads like from the inside: not a permission error from a server that
//!   consulted a list.
//! - [`ROLE_PROBE_NEIGHBOUR`]: writes at the address where its neighbour's pixels really do live, one
//!   page past its own grant. The kernel hands it that address, so it is a perfectly informed
//!   attacker; it faults anyway, because the boundary is the mapping and not the layout.
//! - [`ROLE_PROBE_SCREEN`]: reads the composed screen. It drew into that screen, and it cannot see it:
//!   there is no ambient display here, and a screenshot is a capability.
//! - [`ROLE_CAPTURE`]: was granted a read-only mapping of the screen and of the window list, so it
//!   *can* enumerate and screenshot, and it reports a digest the kernel checks against the picture it
//!   computed itself. Then it tries to write the screen and dies, which is the other half of the
//!   grant: a screenshot tool cannot deface what it can read.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-07-30 (calef, DECISIONS §39), among the names recorded there as always
//! right.
