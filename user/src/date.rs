//! **`date`**: print the wall-clock time (milestone 51; DECISIONS §43, notes/clock.md,
//! notes/calendar.md, notes/date.md).
//!
//! The whole program is: read a page, add the ambient counter, hand the number to `calendar`, send
//! the bytes. It holds two capabilities and neither of them can change anything.
//!
//! # It reads. It does not set. (And that is not an omission.)
//!
//! DECISIONS §43 splits the clock into three authorities that are three *different objects*: read
//! is a **read-only mapping** of the clock page, set is the **same page mapped read/write**, and
//! propose is an **endpoint**. `date` holds the first one, and holding it is the entire reason it
//! cannot do the other two: there is no flag it could pass and no method it could call, because
//! the authority it lacks is a page permission rather than a check somewhere in this file.
//!
//! So there is no `date -s` here, deliberately. A program that set the clock would be a *different*
//! binary holding a *different* capability, and one that did both in one process would be exactly
//! the conflation Unix's `date` inherits and this design refuses. That program is not built; when
//! it is, it will be about thirty lines and it will be recognisable by its wiring rather than by
//! its argument parsing.
//!
//! # The unknown clock is an answer, not a crash
//!
//! `clock_proto::state::UNKNOWN` is a real state and it is the **default**: a frame nobody has
//! published to reads as unknown, so a machine with no RTC (or one whose RTC read a time the clock
//! service did not believe) says so rather than reporting 1970 (DECISIONS §42's no-silent-
//! degradation rule, on the time axis).
//!
//! `std`'s `SystemTime::now()` has to **panic** there, because it has no error channel. `date` has
//! one, and since DECISIONS §67 it has one that is **not** its output. So this program reads the
//! state word *before* it reads the offset, and says which of the two causes it was on its declared
//! second stream. The two are worth telling apart because they call for different fixes: nobody
//! granted this process a clock, or the machine itself never learned the time.
//!
//! # The second stream, and the one rule it comes with
//!
//! `date` is the first program in this system to declare a second output ([`DIAG_SLOT`]), and it is
//! the program the decision was taken for: `date > when.txt` on a clockless machine used to write
//! "the time is unknown" **into the file**, because a complaint about the run and an answer about
//! the time travelled on the same endpoint. Now they do not, and the shell prints the complaint
//! while the file stays empty.
//!
//! The rule that buys is real and belongs here rather than only in a note: **everything this program
//! has to complain about is said, and the stream closed, before it writes a byte of output.** Its
//! reader is single-threaded and drains the second stream to end-of-stream first (there is no
//! receive-on-a-set in this kernel), so a program that interleaved the two would block in a
//! rendezvous send that nobody is listening for. Every complaint here is a reason there is no
//! answer, so the ordering costs `date` nothing; a program with more to say would have to be written
//! for it.
//!
//! # Arguments, which arrive in registers because that is the ABI
//!
//! There is no argv on this ABI; a program gets three words at `_start` (notes/abi.md). So:
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | `a0` | which [`Format`] to print, `FMT_*` below. `0` is `Human`, so a bare spawn is `date` with no arguments. |
//! | `a1` | the UTC offset in **minutes**, as a signed value. `0` is UTC, which is the default and the only sane one here: there is no tzdata (notes/calendar.md). |
//! | `a2` | non-zero to add a second line naming the clock's **provenance**, which is the only way the four-state model is visible to a person. |
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//! date                      Thu 2026-07-30 12:34:56 UTC
//! date  (a0 = FMT_RFC3339)  2026-07-30T12:34:56Z
//! date  (a0 = FMT_UNIX)     1785414896
//! date  (a1 = 330)          Thu 2026-07-30 18:04:56 +05:30
//! date  (a2 = 1)            Thu 2026-07-30 12:34:56 UTC
//!                           date: clock source: rtc, generation 1
//! ```
//!
//! And the case worth reading twice, because it is the one every other OS gets wrong quietly:
//!
//! ```text
//! date  (no clock service)  date: the time is unknown: the machine has no clock it believes
//! date  (no clock granted)  date: the time is unknown: this process holds no clock capability
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **One-second resolution, and the read is not atomic with the print.** The seqlock makes the
//!   *page* read consistent; the counter is sampled just after it. A clock stepped between the two
//!   would be printed as the new time, which is right, but the two lines of a `a2` run can straddle
//!   a step and disagree about the generation. Nothing here needs better and pretending otherwise
//!   would be the lie this milestone exists to remove.
//! - **A fixed UTC offset is not a time zone.** `a1 = -480` is Pacific Standard Time for part of the
//!   year and wrong for the rest. notes/calendar.md records why tzdata is out of scope.
//! - **No `strftime`.** Five named formats, because a format-string interpreter is a second parser
//!   with runtime errors in a program that has no allocator (notes/calendar.md).
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-07-31. A short name for a command a person types, which the
//! tenet makes a choice its author makes rather than a convention to apply; nothing records the
//! choice being made.
