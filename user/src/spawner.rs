//! **The construction sub-server: process building, and nothing else** (milestone 22 phase B.2).
//!
//! Where init's process-construction authority went. It holds one untyped budget (WRITE only, so it
//! may spend memory but never lend it), a request channel, and **one program image** copied into its
//! address space by `root_supervisor`. It does not hold the initrd, so "build me program X" is not a thing that
//! can be asked of it: the only program it can name is the one it was handed.
//!
//! Each instance is built in its **own region** split off the budget, which keeps one instance's
//! corpse from pinning another's memory. A LIFO reap returns the pages to this budget (§16's
//! return-of-pages), so a restart loop is not a leak.
//!
//! **It does not hold the instance regions** (DECISIONS §32). It used to keep each region capability
//! for its whole life, because reaping meant `MemoryRegion::DESTROY` and the supervisor could not do that
//! without construction authority, so the spawner had to reap on request. §32 put the reap on the
//! supervision endpoint, so the capability's only remaining purpose was gone and it is deleted as
//! soon as the child is started. Nothing in the tree now holds a capability to a *live* instance's
//! memory, and the pages still come home when the supervisor collects the corpse.
//!
//! The honest note on what that gives up: nothing, today. A hung instance (livelocked, never dying)
//! was already unreclaimable, because the reap only ever happened on a supervisor's request and a
//! supervisor's requests only ever followed a death message. §32 records that case as the watchdog
//! case and deliberately leaves it open.
//!
//! It is not the supervisor. It never reads a fault message and it holds no policy; it answers
//! requests in the order they arrive. See notes/trusted-init.md.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-07-30 (calef, DECISIONS §39), among the names recorded there as always
//! right.

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
#![allow(missing_docs)]
#![no_main]

// Each binary in the tree compiles the shared module but uses a different slice of it (the sub-server
// builds nothing, the supervisor holds no memory), so the unused halves are expected, not dead. This
// is the one shape where a blanket allow is the honest one: no single binary uses all of it (§38).
