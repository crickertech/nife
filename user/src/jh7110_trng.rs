//! **The JH7110 TRNG driver** (milestone 159; roadmap `design/roadmap/159-jh7110-trng-driver.md`,
//! notes/entropy.md), an alternate backend for the entropy contract (`entropy_proto`,
//! DECISIONS §44), alongside `entropy.rs`'s virtio-rng one. Same contract, same shape ("a driver,
//! not a new protocol"), different device: no virtqueue, no DMA page, just a register window.
//!
//! # It is wired now, and it still has never run
//!
//! **Something spawns this program as of 2026-09-01**: `kernel/src/user/entropy_service.rs`'s
//! `Bus` enum grew a `Jh7110` variant, and the riscv64 boot tour asks for it. The decision the
//! previous draft of this paragraph was holding open (how a spawner locates this binary in an
//! initrd) turned out to need no new answer: `entropy_service::ensure` already takes the program's
//! bytes from its caller, exactly as it does for `entropy`, so the tour reads
//! `user::program("jh7110_trng")` and hands them over. Nothing about the interactive boot changed;
//! DECISIONS §120's stopgap question is still open and still untouched by this.
//!
//! **Nothing below has run against a real TRNG**, and wiring it did not change that: QEMU has no
//! JH7110, so on every machine this repository's CI boots the wiring resolves to a skip. The
//! register sequence follows
//! `jh7110_trng`'s citations (the Linux `jh7110-trng.c` driver); the polling bounds
//! ([`POLL_TRIES`], [`LOCKUP_RETRIES`]) are placeholders with no board measurement behind them, the
//! same honest gap `entropy.rs`'s `WAIT_WAKEUPS` once was before QEMU could prove it. See the
//! roadmap doc for what remains before this can be trusted.
//!
//! # What is proven, and where
//!
//! The register decode ([`jh7110_trng::interpret`]), the device-tree query
//! ([`jh7110_trng::discover`]) and the byte buffer ([`jh7110_trng::Pool`]) are all in the crate,
//! host-tested and Kani-reachable, because none of them needs a device to be wrong in an
//! interesting way. What is left in this file is exactly the part that cannot be tested without
//! silicon: the volatile reads and writes, and the two polling bounds below.
//!
//! # Its authority, once something grants it
//!
//! - slot 0, the **request** endpoint (RECV): clients `CALL` here, `entropy_proto`'s wire format,
//!   unchanged from `entropy.rs`'s;
//! - slot 1, a **readiness** endpoint (WRITE): exactly one message, either
//!   [`proto::READY`](entropy_proto::READY) once the device has answered a first generation with
//!   bytes that are not all zero, or a
//!   [`bringup_failure`](entropy_proto::bringup_failure) word naming which step failed;
//! - mapped: **one page**, the TRNG's register block, device-typed at [`TRNG_VA`], placed there by
//!   whoever spawns this (rule 2: a base address, passed in, nothing this driver looks up). The
//!   binding's `reg` window is `0x4000` and the spawner maps `0x1000` of it, because
//!   `jh7110_trng::regs` reaches only `0x68`;
//! - and nothing else. **No third slot, no DMA page, no IRQ**, unlike `entropy.rs`'s virtio-rng
//!   backend: this device has no virtqueue and no shared buffer to negotiate, only the eight
//!   `RAND` registers, so its authority is smaller by construction, not by omission. An earlier
//!   draft named a slot 2 for a `DeviceFrame` capability; the spawner that actually exists grants
//!   the page as a `Mapping` rather than as a capability the driver holds, so the slot was
//!   describing a thing nobody hands over.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **This driver still programs no clock and deasserts no reset, and something else now does.**
//! The binding names two clock inputs (`hclk`, `ahb`) and one reset line, and Linux's
//! `jh7110-trng.c` takes all three through the clock and reset frameworks before it touches a
//! register. This driver takes none of them: it is handed a mapped register window and assumes the
//! block behind it is powered, which is rule 2 working as intended rather than an omission. The
//! prediction this entry used to carry came true on 2026-09-04 (all-zero registers, a failed first
//! refill, an all-zero bring-up diagnostic), and **milestone 220 answered it**: the kernel now
//! ungates the STG CRG's `SEC_HCLK` and `SEC_MISCAHB_CLK` and releases the block's reset before
//! this program is spawned, and the second boot that day read live registers. What remains here is
//! the dependency itself: nothing in this program checks that it happened, and a boot where it did
//! not still presents as zeros.
//!
//! **A device that answers with zeros is condemned for the whole boot, with no way back.** An
//! all-zero first generation is treated as a bring-up failure
//! ([`proto::STEP_FIRST_ALL_ZERO`](entropy_proto::STEP_FIRST_ALL_ZERO)) and this driver then
//! answers every request `NO_ENTROPY` until it is restarted, even if the block is powered on
//! underneath it a moment later. That is deliberate (a device that answers wrongly is worse than
//! one that does not answer) and it is also the case a real clock driver would want to retry;
//! milestone 220 is where that becomes worth building, and `entropy_proto`'s own `BUGS` carries the
//! probability this refusal is wrong on a working device.
//!
//! **The polling bounds below are guesses.** [`POLL_TRIES`] and [`LOCKUP_RETRIES`] have no board
//! measurement behind them. A bound that is too small reports `NO_ENTROPY` on a working device;
//! too large, and a dead device stalls the boot tour for as long as the loop takes. Nothing has
//! measured which side of that this lands on.
//!
//! **The 256-bit mode selection has never been read back.** [`init`] writes `MODE.R256` because
//! the width a JH7110's TRNG resets to is a build-time parameter of the silicon rather than
//! something the documentation settles, and it reports the `STAT` it read afterwards so a bench
//! session can check `STAT.R256`. Nobody has. If that bit reads clear on radon, this driver is
//! assembling 32 bytes out of a 16-byte answer and the upper four `RAND` words are not device
//! output; the count served would have to drop to 16. **This is the one open correctness question
//! about the bytes themselves**, and one line of a bench transcript closes it.
//!
//! **The polling loops are unbounded in time, not just in count.** [`POLL_TRIES`] counts
//! iterations of a loop with no delay in it, so what it actually bounds depends on how fast this
//! core runs and what the compiler did to the loop. It is a guard against hanging forever, not a
//! timeout anyone can state in microseconds.
//!
//! # Why polling, not the completion interrupt
//!
//! [binding] names `interrupts = <30>`, and the Linux driver is interrupt-driven. This program
//! polls `ISTAT` instead, for one reason worth stating rather than defaulting to: routing PLIC
//! line 30 correctly (which context, which priority) is one more fact this project cannot check
//! without the board, and a wrong interrupt binding fails silently as a hang, while a wrong poll
//! bound fails loudly as `NO_ENTROPY`. This is a reversible choice (AGENTS.md's "recommend on
//! reversible forks"): switching to the interrupt once the board confirms the binding is a
//! smaller change than getting IRQ routing wrong on the first hardware boot ever attempted.
