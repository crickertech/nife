//! **The entropy service** (milestone 56; DECISIONS §44, notes/entropy.md).
//!
//! The one process that owns a virtio-rng device, and the only thing in the system that can read
//! it. Everything else holds an endpoint that means *"you may obtain randomness"*, which is a
//! strictly smaller authority than *"you may reach the device"*: a client cannot program the
//! queue, cannot see the DMA region the device writes into, and cannot ask the device for anything
//! this service did not ask on its behalf.
//!
//! ```text
//!   virtio-rng ──virtio (mmio or PCIe, §18)──► entropy ──the request endpoint──► clients
//!    (a device)                                  │        (CALL, bytes in the reply)
//!                                                └── its DMA page: nobody else maps it
//! ```
//!
//! Its whole authority is four things placed before it ran:
//!
//! - slot 0, the **request** endpoint (RECV): clients `CALL` here and nothing else;
//! - slot 1, an **`Irq`**: the device's completion interrupt;
//! - slot 2, a **`Virtio`**: the confined transport, and the only way it can reach the device;
//! - slot 3, a **readiness** endpoint (WRITE): one message once the first bytes are in hand;
//! - mapped: one DMA page, which nobody else maps.
//!
//! No initrd, no budget, no filesystem, no network. A compromised entropy service is a machine
//! whose random numbers an attacker chooses, which is exactly as much damage as owning the
//! entropy source should be worth, and it is why the device does not sit inside every program.
//!
//! # It passes the device's bytes through, and computes nothing
//!
//! No pool, no whitening, no mixing, no DRBG. There is no cryptography in this tree yet (that is
//! milestone 56's other half), and without a one-way function every transformation available here
//! is a reversible permutation: it would change the bytes without adding an unpredictability an
//! attacker could not undo, while making the security claim harder to state. So the claim stays
//! one sentence long: **these are the device's bytes**. See DECISIONS §44.
//!
//! What it does keep is a **buffer**, which is a different thing from a pool. One virtio request
//! fetches [`POOL_LEN`] bytes and the service hands them out in order, refilling when they run
//! out. Byte *i* out is byte *i* in, unmodified, handed to exactly one client, and zeroed behind
//! the cursor. That is a cache for round trips, not an entropy transformation, and it turns 32
//! device round trips into one.
//!
//! # When the device gives less than it was asked for
//!
//! virtio-rng is allowed to return fewer bytes than the buffer holds, and the used ring's `len` is
//! where it says so. **QEMU's really does**, which is worth stating as a measurement rather than a
//! spec allowance: the first version of this file passed a short buffer straight through to the
//! client, and the milestone-56 test caught a five-byte reply to an eight-byte request thirty draws
//! in. So the service takes what arrived and asks again for the rest, gathering across the boundary
//! (see [`Pool::take`]). It never pads, never repeats a byte it has already served, and never
//! substitutes a pseudo-random stand-in. If the device produces nothing at all across
//! [`REFILL_TRIES`] attempts, the reply is [`entropy_proto::NO_ENTROPY`] and the caller finds out,
//! because a caller who cannot be given randomness must not be told otherwise (DECISIONS §42).
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-07-30 with milestone 56, on the resource-name pattern `clock`
//! also follows.
