//! **The entropy service** (milestone 56; DECISIONS §44, notes/entropy.md).
//!
//! The one process that owns a virtio-rng device, and the only thing in the system that can read
//! it. Everything else holds an endpoint that means *"you may obtain randomness"*, which is a
//! strictly smaller authority than *"you may reach the device"*: a client cannot program the
//! queue, cannot see the DMA region the device writes into, and cannot ask the device for anything
//! this service did not ask on its behalf.
//!
//! ```text
//!   virtio-rng ──virtio (mmio or PCIe, §18)──► entropy ──the request endpoint──► clients
//!    (a device)                                  │        (CALL, bytes in the reply)
//!                                                └── its DMA page: nobody else maps it
//! ```
//!
//! Its whole authority is four things placed before it ran:
//!
//! - slot 0, the **request** endpoint (RECV): clients `CALL` here and nothing else;
//! - slot 1, an **`Irq`**: the device's completion interrupt;
//! - slot 2, a **`Virtio`**: the confined transport, and the only way it can reach the device;
//! - slot 3, a **readiness** endpoint (WRITE): one message once the first bytes are in hand;
//! - mapped: one DMA page, which nobody else maps.
//!
//! No initrd, no budget, no filesystem, no network. A compromised entropy service is a machine
//! whose random numbers an attacker chooses, which is exactly as much damage as owning the
//! entropy source should be worth, and it is why the device does not sit inside every program.
//!
//! # It passes the device's bytes through, and computes nothing
//!
//! No pool, no whitening, no mixing, no DRBG. There is no cryptography in this tree yet (that is
//! milestone 56's other half), and without a one-way function every transformation available here
//! is a reversible permutation: it would change the bytes without adding an unpredictability an
//! attacker could not undo, while making the security claim harder to state. So the claim stays
//! one sentence long: **these are the device's bytes**. See DECISIONS §44.
//!
//! What it does keep is a **buffer**, which is a different thing from a pool. One virtio request
//! fetches [`POOL_LEN`] bytes and the service hands them out in order, refilling when they run
//! out. Byte *i* out is byte *i* in, unmodified, handed to exactly one client, and zeroed behind
//! the cursor. That is a cache for round trips, not an entropy transformation, and it turns 32
//! device round trips into one.
//!
//! # When the device gives less than it was asked for
//!
//! virtio-rng is allowed to return fewer bytes than the buffer holds, and the used ring's `len` is
//! where it says so. **QEMU's really does**, which is worth stating as a measurement rather than a
//! spec allowance: the first version of this file passed a short buffer straight through to the
//! client, and the milestone-56 test caught a five-byte reply to an eight-byte request thirty draws
//! in. So the service takes what arrived and asks again for the rest, gathering across the boundary
//! (see [`Pool::take`]). It never pads, never repeats a byte it has already served, and never
//! substitutes a pseudo-random stand-in. If the device produces nothing at all across
//! [`REFILL_TRIES`] attempts, the reply is [`entropy_proto::NO_ENTROPY`] and the caller finds out,
//! because a caller who cannot be given randomness must not be told otherwise (DECISIONS §42).
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-07-30 with milestone 56, on the resource-name pattern `clock`
//! also follows.
//!
//! # A second backend, and a smaller authority than the first (milestone 162)
//!
//! RDRAND/RDSEED (`x86_64`) and RNDR/RNDRRS (aarch64, `FEAT_RNG`) are **unprivileged CPU instructions**:
//! no MMIO, no capability, no device discovery, executable at any privilege level. That is exactly
//! the trap DECISIONS §44 exists to name: if this service let a client obtain those bytes by
//! executing the instruction itself, the request endpoint above would be theatre, because ambient
//! authority to the CPU is ambient authority to entropy. So [`instr`] is not a function a client
//! links; it is the same shape as the virtio backend above, a second way *this* process reaches
//! bytes, still gated behind the one endpoint every client already holds.
//!
//! **The kernel decides which backend a boot gets, the same way it decides `Bus::Mmio` vs.
//! `Bus::Pci`.** `ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1.RNDR` (aarch64) is only readable at EL1 (a userspace `MRS` on it
//! traps as an unknown register, `arch::isa::init` already reads it into the boot-time record), so
//! this process never probes for the feature itself; it trusts the kernel's choice of which mode to
//! spawn it in the same way it already trusts a granted `Virtio` capability to name a real device.
//! See `kernel/src/user/entropy_service.rs::ensure_instruction`.
//!
//! **Why RDSEED/RNDRRS and not RDRAND/RNDR.** Intel's own DRNG Software Implementation Guide (rev.
//! 2.2) documents `RDRAND` as SP800-90C RBG2(P) output: a hardware `CTR_DRBG` seeded from the
//! conditioned entropy source, servicing up to 511 draws per reseed. `RDSEED` instead comes
//! straight off the SP800-90C RBG3(XOR) enhanced non-deterministic generator, one draw, one fresh
//! sample of the conditioned entropy source, no DRBG in the path. ARM's RNDR/RNDRRS pair is the same
//! split (RNDR may be DRBG-buffered the way RDRAND is; RNDRRS forces a reseed from the entropy
//! source before it answers, the way RDSEED does). This service's whole discipline is "no pool, no
//! whitening, no mixing, **no DRBG**", stated two paragraphs up; taking RDRAND or RNDR would
//! silently reintroduce, in hardware, the exact primitive this file already refuses to add in
//! software. RDSEED/RNDRRS are the instructions that keep the claim "these are the device's bytes"
//! true. The cost is real and is not hidden: both are rate-limited by the physical entropy source
//! and can run dry under load in a way RDRAND/RNDR, buffered by their DRBG, do not; a caller that
//! exhausts the retry budget gets [`proto::NO_ENTROPY`], the same honest answer a dry virtio device
//! gives, rather than a fallback to the DRBG-backed sibling instruction.
//!
//! On-die conditioning is a different question from a DRBG and this service does not refuse it:
//! both Intel's noise source and ARM's entropy source run an AES-CBC-MAC-shaped conditioner
//! (SP800-90B's noise-source-plus-conditioning-function model) before either instruction's output is
//! ever visible to software. That conditioning is part of the instruction's own architectural
//! contract, the same way it is part of what "a device" means for virtio-rng; this file adds nothing
//! on top of it either way.
