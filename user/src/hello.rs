//! The initrd program. **One binary, two roles**, chosen by the argument the kernel puts in
//! `x0` at `_start`, the way a real kernel hands a new process its argc.
//!
//! - **Role `CLIENT`**: an ordinary program that wants to print. It does not own a UART and
//!   cannot reach one. It writes its text into a page it *shares* with the console server, and
//!   sends the length over an endpoint. That is the whole of "printing" now.
//!
//! - **The console driver, at EL0** (milestone 8: this code used to be in the kernel; milestone 8
//!   is where it left). It owns a mapping of the PL011's registers and a read-only view of the
//!   shared page, and loops: receive a length, copy that many bytes from the shared page to the
//!   UART, acknowledge. It is its own binary now (`user/src/console.rs`, 19f.3), no longer a role
//!   of hello, so hello keeps only the printing client that drives it.
//!
//! # Why the bytes travel in shared memory and the length travels in a message
//!
//! DECISIONS §10: **IPC carries control, shared memory carries data.** The kernel is not in the
//! data path at all. It never sees the bytes, never copies them, never validates a pointer into
//! them. The confused-deputy problem that 7d had to defend against **cannot arise here**, because
//! the thing that could be confused (a kernel doing I/O for a user) no longer exists. The
//! architecture dissolved the bug.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-07-14 as the first program the kernel ever loaded, and the
//! name has outlived the description: on aarch64 it also carries the `init_boot` role, which the
//! name does not say.
