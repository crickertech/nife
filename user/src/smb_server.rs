//! **The SMB adapter** (milestone 54): a network file service a Mac can mount.
//!
//! The roadmap block names the shape and this program is exactly it: an adapter holding **one
//! network endpoint and one share**, speaking SMB2 on the wire side and nothing but the `Share`
//! seam on the file side. All protocol logic lives in `smb_proto` (host-tested, rule 7); this
//! binary owns only the IO: listen and accept through the socket contract (milestone 107's
//! inbound half), reassemble the direct-TCP framing from `RECV`'s bounded chunks, hand each
//! message to `smb_proto::server::Connection`, and push the answer back out through `SEND`.
//!
//! The share has two backings behind the one `Share` seam, chosen by `arg2`, which also says
//! which **direction** the share is served in (the write path made that a separate question):
//!
//! - **The filesystem_proto-backed share** ([`FsShare`]), the milestone's real one: this program holds a
//!   directory capability into the FS server (the endpoint IS the capability, DECISIONS §27) and
//!   answers every `Share` question with `filesystem_proto` verbs, so a client of the mount is reading
//!   and writing RedoxFS bytes. This is what both the test boot and the serve boot wire when a
//!   RedoxFS disk is attached, both of them read-write.
//! - **The fixture** (`smb_proto::share::FIXTURE`), files baked into this binary: the no-disk
//!   fallback, kept because it lets the whole protocol path run and gate with no FS service in
//!   the boot, and because a wire bug is easier to hunt against a share that cannot be wrong.
//!   Read-only, and it is `Share`'s worked example of a backing that says so.
//!
//! All protocol code is indifferent to which one it is serving; see notes/smb.md.
//!
//! # Identity (milestone 54's last item)
//!
//! `arg2` also says **who may connect**, and [`CredentialAuthenticator`] is the answer that is not
//! "everyone": a session must present an NTLMv2 proof that milestone 65's credential service
//! accepts. This program holds one more endpoint for that and no key at all; read that type's doc
//! for what it can and cannot do, and `smb_proto::authenticator` for why the seam carries no key
//! material in either direction.
//!
//! **Where access control lives, and it is one place.** A [`Verdict`] decides whether a session
//! exists. It does not decide what the session may do: the share's rights are the rights of the one
//! directory capability in slot [`FS`], identical for every session, enforced by the FS server.
//! Per-user rights therefore mean per-user adapters, one directory capability each, which
//! milestone 47's rights split already expresses. A share whose rights lived both here and in the
//! grant would be a share whose rights can disagree with themselves.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//! - slot 0: the report endpoint (WRITE)
//! - slot 1: the `Stack` endpoint (WRITE), shared with the stack's other client if any
//! - slot 2: an untyped budget (to mint and delegate the shared frame)
//! - slot 3: the file-service endpoint (WRITE), the directory capability the share serves.
//!   Present only when `arg2` says fs-backed, along with [`FS_VA`] mapped to the whole file
//!   channel shared with the FS server (`fs::TRANSFER_MAX` bytes, not one page).
//! - slot 4: the credential service's **verify** endpoint (WRITE), present only when `arg2` says
//!   authenticated, along with [`CRED_VA`] mapped to the page shared with that service. Not the
//!   provision endpoint, which does not exist any more by the time this program runs.
//! - arg0: connections to serve before reporting OK; 0 means serve forever (the demo boot)
//! - arg1: the TCP port to listen on (445 in the demo boot; the test grants a neighbour of the
//!   echo gate's port instead, see the kernel test)
//! - arg2: which share, in which direction, and to whom. 0 is the fixture, 1 the filesystem_proto-backed
//!   share read-only, 2 read-write to guests, 3 read-write to a proven identity
//!   ([`SHARE_FIXTURE`] and its three neighbours). The write path split this from a flag because a
//!   **read-only view of the real filesystem** is a thing a boot should be able to wire and a
//!   boolean could not say; identity added a third question a boolean could not say either.
//!
//! # Socket ids
//!
//! The listener is sid 2 and the connection sid 3, **not** 0 and 1: in the combined inbound gate
//! this program shares one `Stack` endpoint with `socket_test_client`, whose exchange owns 0 and
//! 1, and a stack endpoint's socket table is per-endpoint (`socket_proto`'s BUGS: clients sharing an
//! endpoint are indistinguishable to the server). Two clients, four sids, no collision.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A listing still costs a walk.** `QUERY_DIRECTORY` re-walks `READDIR` from cursor 0 for
//!   each entry and pays an OPEN + FSTAT + CLOSE to learn its size, because `filesystem_proto`'s dirent
//!   records carry name and kind only. Reads and writes no longer pay it: the write path made
//!   the `Share` id the FS server's own handle, and milestone 55 made the transfer the whole file
//!   channel, so a 64 KiB read or write is **one** `fs::READ` or `fs::WRITE` and nothing else.
//! - **A handle is never reclaimed if a client vanishes mid-connection.** The FS server's handle
//!   table is per server, and this adapter closes what it opened only on CLOSE or when the
//!   `Connection` is dropped at end of connection; a connection torn down between a CREATE and
//!   its CLOSE leaks one FS handle for the life of the FS server. Bounded by `MAX_HANDLES` per
//!   connection, unbounded across connections, and the fix is the `Connection` telling the share
//!   what to release, which is a seam change rather than a line.
//! - **A path costs one descent per component, on every call.** `open("a\\b\\c")` is two
//!   `fs::OPENDIR`s and an `fs::OPEN`, and the two directory handles are opened and closed again
//!   for the next call. There is no cache because a cache would have to be invalidated by every
//!   other client of the same FS server, and this program cannot see them. Reads and writes are
//!   unaffected: they go through the handle CREATE minted.
//! - **A directory cannot be moved into another directory**, only renamed in place, because
//!   `filesystem_proto::fs::RENAME` refuses it (its doc argues the boundary). It arrives at the client as
//!   an unexpected-IO status rather than as something more useful, which is a gap worth naming: an
//!   `EINVAL` from that verb means two different things and this share cannot tell which.
//! - **Upper-case FS names are unreachable.** The wire folds names to lower-case ASCII before
//!   lookup, and the FS is case-sensitive, so only lower-case names on disk can be opened.
//! - **One connection at a time.** A second client connecting while one is served is refused by
//!   TCP (the listener's backlog is one, `socket_proto`'s BUGS) or waits for the re-arm. macOS uses
//!   one connection per mount.
//! - **A dropped connection costs a 15 s stall**: `RECV` on a dead connection runs into
//!   `net_stack`'s bounded wait before it reports failure, and only then does this server re-arm.
//!   A clean unmount (LOGOFF) is detected and costs nothing.
//! - **The demo boot still serves guests, and so the thing a person actually runs is still open to
//!   everyone who can reach the port.** `--features smb_serve` wires `SHARE_FS_READ_WRITE`, not
//!   [`SHARE_FS_AUTHENTICATED`], because there is no way to *tell* that boot a password: the only
//!   thing in the tree that provisions the credential store is a test program with a published
//!   fixture in it, and shipping a demo whose password Microsoft printed would be worse than a
//!   labelled guest share. The gate is authenticated; the demo says guest in its own banner. What
//!   closes this is a provisioning path, not a flag.
//! - **An authenticated share authenticates exactly one account**, because it is configured with one
//!   resource ([`CredentialAuthenticator::resource`], which also records why that configuration is
//!   in the wrong place). Several accounts mean several adapters today.
//! - **Sessions are not signed.** A proven session is proven at setup and unprotected afterwards, so
//!   an attacker on the path can inject into it. That is `smb_proto`'s scope note as much as this
//!   program's, and it is what `SessionBaseKey` exists for: the credential service publishes one and
//!   this adapter does not ask for it. Nothing here is worse than the guest share it replaces, and
//!   the honest reading is that identity buys authentication of the *client*, not integrity of the
//!   *stream*.
//! - **The server challenge is `now()`**, a clock this program holds rather than entropy it does not.
//!   Two connections in the same tick would repeat a challenge, and a repeated challenge is what
//!   makes a captured proof replayable. It is a real gap: the fix is an entropy capability, which is
//!   milestone 56's service and one more slot.
//! - The remaining protocol-level limitations (ASCII names, discarded timestamps) are `smb_proto`'s
//!   and are listed in that crate's header.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Provisional, minted by milestone 54's lane on 2026-08-15: the program is the
//! server half of SMB, and `fs_server` set the `<protocol>_server` shape. Expect ratification to
//! reconsider it beside `net_stack` (which serves the socket contract but is not `socket_server`).
