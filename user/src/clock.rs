//! **The clock service** (milestone 51 lane A; DECISIONS §43, notes/clock.md).
//!
//! The one process that owns the real-time clock's registers and the wall clock's offset. Its
//! entire authority is four things placed before it ran: the propose endpoint (slot 0, RECV), a
//! report endpoint (slot 1, WRITE, for whoever wired it), the **clock page** mapped read/write, and
//! the **RTC's registers** as a device mapping. No initrd, no budget, no network, nothing it could
//! build anything with. A compromised clock service is a machine that believes the wrong time,
//! which is exactly as much damage as owning the clock should be worth.
//!
//! # What it does, in order
//!
//! 1. Stamp the clock page (it starts as an honest [`clock_proto::state::UNKNOWN`]).
//! 2. Read the RTC once, through whichever driver the *machine* named (`a0`, from the device
//!    tree's `compatible`, not from `target_arch`), or, on `x86_64`, take the reading the *kernel*
//!    already made (`a1`), because the CMOS clock is two I/O ports the kernel keeps to itself
//!    (DECISIONS §121, §130; milestone 176).
//! 3. If the reading is plausible, publish it. **If it is not, publish nothing**: the page stays
//!    unknown and every reader can see that the machine does not know what time it is. This is
//!    DECISIONS §42's no-silent-degradation rule; the alternative is confidently reporting 1970.
//! 4. Serve proposals forever, each judged by `clock_proto::policy` and none of them able to set
//!    the clock outright.
//!
//! # The three authorities are three different objects, and only one of them is here
//!
//! **Reading does not come through this process at all.** A reader holds the clock page read-only
//! and the ambient monotonic counter, and computes the time itself: two loads and an add, no
//! syscall, no round trip. **Setting** is a read/write mapping of that same page, which is a
//! capability this process holds and could hand on; writing the offset *is* setting the clock.
//! **Proposing** is the endpoint below, and it is deliberately not either of those. See the
//! contract crate's module docs for the picture.
//!
//! The one thing worth understanding about the shape: this process has **one blocking wait point**,
//! because the kernel has no wait-any primitive and no threads sharing an address space. So it can
//! serve exactly one endpoint, and a design that wanted `set` and `propose` to both be messages
//! would have needed two servers. Making `set` a page write instead is not a workaround; it is
//! what "set the offset outright" already means (DECISIONS §43).
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-07-30. Milestone 63 weighed the plain resource noun against
//! the agent noun for the credential service and chose `credentialer` there, on the ground that the
//! service will never hand you a credential; this program keeps the resource name and no record
//! says whether the same question was asked of it.

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
