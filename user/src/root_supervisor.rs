//! **The root supervisor: an init that gives its authority away** (milestone 22 phase B.2).
//!
//! init is the unverified component that builds every other process, and phase B.1 closed the
//! question of *what bytes it is*. This closes the other half: **what a broken one can still do.**
//!
//! The pre-B.2 init (`system_initializer`, `hello`'s init role) holds a large untyped budget for its entire life,
//! because it stays the system's process builder. Every process in the system is therefore one bug in
//! init away from being built wrong. This program instead holds full construction authority for
//! exactly as long as it takes to build two servers, and then **deletes it**:
//!
//! ```text
//!   root_supervisor   root untyped + the initrd + a report endpoint      (briefly)
//!     |
//!     +-- spawner   one program image, one budget, no initrd     (can build only that program)
//!     |
//!     +-- sub_server_supervisor    a request channel + a fault endpoint         (holds NO memory at all)
//!             |
//!             +-- flaky   a report endpoint                      (the supervised sub-server)
//!
//!   then: root_supervisor deletes its untyped and becomes a RECV loop on its own supervision endpoint.
//! ```
//!
//! After the handoff `root_supervisor` cannot build a process, cannot endow anyone with memory, and cannot
//! reach the sub-servers' internals. What is left of it is a supervisor so small it essentially
//! cannot fail: receive a death, report it, stop. A compromised `root_supervisor` at that point can lie about
//! deaths on one endpoint. That is the entire blast radius.
//!
//! The restart policy is `sub_server_supervisor`'s, in userspace, and the kernel never relaunches anything
//! (DECISIONS §26). See notes/trusted-init.md and notes/supervision.md.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `rootsup`. Refused `rootsup` and
//! `root_sup` (`sup` was the abbreviation, so putting a separator in it would have relocated the
//! problem rather than fixed it).

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
