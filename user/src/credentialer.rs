//! **The secrets service** (milestone 56's credential half, generalised by milestone 65;
//! notes/credentials.md and notes/ntlm.md).
//!
//! **Hold the key, expose the operation, never the key.** The one process in the system that holds
//! secrets, and the only thing that can read them. Everything else holds an endpoint that means
//! *"you may ask this store to compute with a secret"*, which is a strictly smaller authority than
//! *"you may read the secret"*: a client cannot enumerate the identities, cannot obtain a salt, a
//! tag or an NTLM key, and cannot write a record.
//!
//! **This program's name lags its job**, and knowingly. Milestone 65 says the credentialer becomes
//! one operation in a secrets service rather than a service beside it, because a second process
//! holding secrets is exactly what the design exists to avoid. So the generalisation happened here
//! rather than in a new program. A rename is a naming decision and belongs to calef (CLAUDE.md);
//! this header is the note that it is owed.
//!
//! # Two kinds of secret, two operations, one store
//!
//! | secret | operation | never exposed |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | an Argon2id tag | `VERIFY`: is this the secret? | the tag, the salt |
//! | an `NTOWFv2` | `NTLM_PROOF`: is this the proof, and here is the session key | the key |
//!
//! The second is the reason this is a milestone rather than another opcode. **NTLMv2 does not
//! verify a presented secret**: the client never sends the password, the server holds a key and
//! computes a MAC, so "secret in, boolean out" does not fit it. What the SMB server gets is an
//! endpoint that answers challenges. Compromise it and an attacker can authenticate sessions
//! *while they hold the endpoint*, and cannot extract the key, crack it offline, or carry it
//! anywhere else. Storing the key in the SMB server offers none of that, which is what Samba does.

//!   a client ────────the verify endpoint───────►└────────────┘
//!              (VERIFY / NTLM_PROOF, forever)      the store lives here and nowhere else
//! ```
//!
//! # Two phases, because this kernel has one wait point
//!
//! The clock service records the constraint (user/src/clock.rs): there is no wait-any primitive
//! and no threads inside one address space, so a process can block on exactly **one** endpoint.
//! The clock's answer was to make its wide authority a page write rather than a message. This
//! service's answer is different and, for a credential store, better: writing the store is not an
//! *operation* at all, it is a **phase**, and the phase ends.
//!
//! 1. **Provision.** RECV on the provision endpoint. Each [`credential_proto::provision::PUT`] and
//!    [`credential_proto::provision::PUT_NTLM`] derives a record with a salt drawn from the entropy
//!    service. [`credential_proto::provision::SEAL`] ends it.
//! 2. **Delete.** The service `cap_delete`s its receive end of the provision endpoint, and the
//!    provisioner deletes its send end. Nothing in the system can name it any more.
//! 3. **Serve.** RECV on the verify endpoint, forever. Two opcodes, one per kind of secret. Yes
//!    or no, and on an NTLM yes, a session key in the shared page.
//!
//! **That is the asymmetry, and it is structural rather than a check.** A client is not refused
//! permission to write the store; there is no object through which the request could travel by the
//! time a client holds anything. Compare a Unix password database, where `smbd` opens the file and
//! the only thing standing between a compromised server and every hash in it is that the code does
//! not choose to read them.
//!
//! # It never invents a salt
//!
//! Every salt comes from the entropy service (DECISIONS §44), and a provisioning request that
//! cannot get one is answered [`credential_proto::NO_ENTROPY`] rather than being served with something
//! weaker. A predictable salt is a store one rainbow table covers, so falling back would be
//! exactly the silent degradation DECISIONS §42 forbids, in the one place it would be hardest to
//! notice: everything would keep working.
//!
//! The decoy record's salt and tag come from the same place, at start-up. A service that could not
//! draw them **refuses to start**, because a credential service with no unpredictable bits cannot
//! do its job and saying so is the only honest option.
//!
//! # Capability contract (notes/abi.md §4)
//!
//! - slot 0: the **provision** endpoint (RECV), deleted at the seal
//! - slot 1: the **verify** endpoint (RECV)
//! - slot 2: the **entropy** service's endpoint (WRITE)
//! - slot 3: an **untyped budget**, for the memory-hard scratch and nothing else
//! - slot 4: a **readiness** endpoint (WRITE), one message once the store is sealed
//! - mapped: the provision page, and the verify page. **Two frames, never one**: the provisioner
//!   writes plaintext secrets into its page, and a client that shared that frame would read them.
//!
//! No initrd, no filesystem, no network, no device. A compromised secrets service is a machine
//! whose logins an attacker can answer and whose shares they can authenticate to, for as long as
//! they hold it, which is exactly as much damage as owning the store should be worth. It is not
//! a machine whose passwords they can carry away.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **One verify page means one client at a time.** The page is per service, not per channel, so
//! two clients sharing the endpoint would also share the frame each writes its presented secret
//! into. Nothing here detects that. `filesystem_proto`'s answer (one page per channel) is the shape to
//! copy when a second client exists; today the intended client is the single SMB adapter.
//!
//! **Nothing survives a reboot.** The store is memory only. Secrets at rest are unsolved and this
//! service does not pretend otherwise; see notes/credentials.md.
//!
//! **No rate limit, no lockout, no attempt counter.** A client holding the verify endpoint can
//! guess as fast as it can `CALL`, and each guess costs it one Argon2id derivation of the service's
//! time. That cost is the only thing slowing an online attack down, and it is also a way to make
//! the service unresponsive to everyone else.
//!
//! **`NTLM_PROOF` does not even have that.** An NTLM answer is three MD5-shaped operations, four
//! orders of magnitude cheaper than a password verify, so the KDF's incidental rate limiting does
//! not apply to it at all. Online guessing against it is still useless (a guess is a 128-bit MAC,
//! not a password), but it is a free way to spin this service, and a service that answers logins
//! is a service worth spinning. Nothing here counts requests.
//!
//! **Revocation is per holder, not per secret.** Destroying a client's endpoint ends its access,
//! which is the thing this design buys and a stored hash could never offer. Revoking one *secret*
//! is a different question and this service cannot answer it: the store is sealed, so there is no
//! object through which a record could be removed, which is the same property that makes the seal
//! worth having. Rotating a secret means restarting the service and reprovisioning, so a
//! deployment that needs finer granularity runs more than one. See notes/credentials.md.
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `credential`. Refused `credential`
//! (the plain resource noun, on the pattern `clock` and `entropy` follow). The argument for it was
//! made twice and wrong twice: `credentialer` is a real profession rather than a coinage, and this
//! service will never give you a credential, so naming it for the resource implies the one thing it
//! exists to refuse.
//!
//! **That ratification predates what this program became.** Milestone 65 turned it from a
//! credential service into a **secrets service**: it now holds an `NTOWFv2` beside the
//! Argon2id tag and answers `NTLM_PROOF`, so the argument above ("this service will never
//! give you a credential") still holds while the noun no longer describes the scope. A
//! rename is owed, and it is calef's, not a lane's; `cred`, `credential_proto` and
//! `credentialer_test_client` are in the same boat. Recorded here rather than acted on.
