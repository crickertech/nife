//! **The confiner: the process that confines a C component and proves it** (milestone 36,
//! DECISIONS §31).
//!
//! It is three roles in one program, and the fusion is deliberate rather than lazy:
//!
//! 1. **Builder.** It splits a region off its budget per instance and lays `c_shim` out in it, so a
//!    single `Untyped::DESTROY` reaps a whole instance (§16 object revocation).
//! 2. **Supervisor.** It holds the C component's supervision endpoint (§26), so a fault becomes a
//!    five-word message it receives rather than a silence it has to guess at, and it decides whether
//!    to restart. The kernel relaunches nothing.
//! 3. **Checker.** It holds the witness pages in *its own* address space, so "nothing outside the
//!    grant changed" is asserted from the other side of an MMU boundary rather than from inside the
//!    process that just misbehaved.
//!
//! **Why roles 1 and 2 are one process here, and what that no longer costs.** This program is the
//! measurement that produced DECISIONS §32: reaping used to need `WRITE` on the region the corpse
//! lives in, which is the same right that *builds* a process out of it, so a supervisor that
//! restarted its child either held construction authority or proxied the reap through something that
//! did. §32 put the reap on the supervision endpoint instead, and role 2 here now uses it: the
//! corpse is collected with `user_rt::reap`, and the per-instance region capability is deleted as
//! soon as the child is started rather than held for the instance's whole life.
//!
//! **What that did not remove, which is itself a finding about §32.** This program still holds a full
//! construction budget, because it is *also* role 1, the builder: it splits a region per instance and
//! lays `c_shim` out in it, and §32 does not touch construction. What §32 removed is the reason a
//! *supervisor* had to hold one. Read as a measurement: the bundling §31 recorded was two things, and
//! only one of them was the reap. Split roles 1 and 2 into separate processes and the supervisor half
//! would now hold nothing but endpoints, which is exactly what milestone 22's `sub_server_supervisor` does since
//! §32. Keeping them fused here is still deliberate (§31: the requirement is visible in one program
//! instead of hidden behind an IPC hop). See DECISIONS §31's "what the supervisor had to hold".
//!
//! Role 3 is genuinely separate from the C component and must be: a checker inside the faulting
//! address space could only report what that address space could see, which is exactly the thing
//! under suspicion.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 61), replacing `cwarden`. Refused `cwarden` and the
//! whole `warden` family, a synonym this project invented for a pattern that already has a name:
//! DECISIONS §50 settled that using the literature's word claims "this is that", where a synonym
//! asserts novelty there is none. Refused the caretaker noun for this one specifically: it holds a
//! region and confines foreign code rather than attenuating a directory capability to a narrower
//! one, so it is deliberately outside that family.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
#![allow(missing_docs)]
#![no_main]

// A source file shared by several binaries through `#[path]`, and each uses a different slice of it,
// so the unused halves are expected. This is the one shape where a blanket allow is the honest one:
// the module is compiled once per binary and no single binary is meant to use all of it (§38).

// The loader, shared with the milestone-22 supervision tree. `ChildEndowment.maps` and `ChildEndowment.fault` are the
// two parts this milestone leans on: a child born with shared pages and born supervised.
