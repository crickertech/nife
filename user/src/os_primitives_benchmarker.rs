//! EL0 microbenchmarks, measured the lmbench way (the cross-OS primitive suite, milestone 21+).
//!
//! The kernel-side benchmarks in `kernel/src/bench.rs` measure path length *inside* the kernel: the
//! bench threads are kernel threads calling `sched::` directly, so they never pay the EL0->EL1 trap.
//! lmbench measures from userspace, trap included, so to compare nife to lmbench we have to
//! measure from **here**, at EL0, self-timing a loop of real `svc` syscalls. That is this program.
//!
//! It is spawned by the bench boot (`kernel/src/bench.rs`), self-times each primitive with
//! `user_rt::now` (the virtual counter, EL0-readable since milestone 19e), and SENDs `[ticks, iters]`
//! home on the one endpoint it was granted (slot 0). The bench boot prints it in the same
//! machine-readable line the rest of the harness uses, so the icount baseline gates it and `--real`
//! gives its true magnitude. Five primitives: null syscall, context switch, IPC round trip, page
//! map, and spawn. Spawn is the whole reason object revocation was built: the loop reclaims each
//! child's region (`Untyped::DESTROY`) so it can repeat.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `elbench`, and it is the name that
//! forced `nifefs`'s `NAME_LEN` from 24 to 32. The raise was taken first and on its own merits,
//! deliberately, because choosing a worse name to fit a limit and raising a limit because a name
//! demanded it are both the wrong way round. Refused `elbench` (`el` is aarch64-only vocabulary for
//! a program that runs on both ISAs, since RISC-V has U, S and M modes and no exception levels) and
//! `os_primitives_benchmark` (this tree already uses "benchmark" for the output:
//! `bench/baseline.txt` holds the numbers, so the agent noun names the producer).

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
