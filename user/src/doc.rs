//! **`doc`: the viewer** (milestone 40, notes/manual.md).
//!
//! It reads markdown on its input and writes it rendered on its output. That is the whole program.
//! The rendering is `crates/manual`, host-tested in milliseconds; what lives here is the two ends of
//! the sink contract and eight kilobytes of `.bss`.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Provisional, minted by milestone 40's lane on 2026-08-04 and not yet put to
//! calef. It is the roadmap's own word for this program. `man` is the live alternative and carries
//! the stronger argument that a reader already knows it from outside this project; the counter is
//! that `man` names a *format* elsewhere and this reads plain markdown. Deliberately not the same
//! name as `crates/manual`, though the two are the usual crate-and-program pair: see that crate's
//! header for why. See notes/naming.md.
//!
//! # It cannot name a page, and that is the demonstration
//!
//! A Unix `man` opens the file it prints, which means it can open any file its caller can. This one
//! is handed bytes. `doc notes/glob.md` is the *shell* resolving that name against the directory
//! capability it holds and streaming what it finds; nothing in this program's cspace names a file, a
//! directory or the filesystem, and there is no message it can send to find out what it is reading.
//!
//! That is the same claim `wc` makes (notes/pipes.md) and it lands harder here, because a
//! documentation viewer is exactly the program a reader would expect to go and fetch things. It
//! does not. `doc < notes/glob.md`, `doc notes/glob.md` and `something | doc` are one behaviour
//! with three sources.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//!
//! | slot | what | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | the output sink, `WRITE` | where the rendered bytes go |
//! | 1 | the input source, `READ` | where the markdown comes from |
//!
//! Two capabilities. No memory grant, because the renderer never allocates; no file, no directory,
//! no shared page, no clock.
//!
//! # Colour is a capability question, answered by the shell
//!
//! This program cannot tell whether its sink is a terminal, a file or another program, and the sink
//! contract is built so that it cannot: that is what makes redirection one grant rather than a
//! negotiation. So it does not sniff the way `isatty` sniffs. It emits **plain text**, and the
//! terminal-bound case is the shell's to arrange.
//!
//! **This is the honest half of a limitation, not a design win**: it means `doc notes/glob.md` at
//! the prompt is currently monochrome even though the renderer can colour it, because the shell has
//! no way to say "this stage ends at the terminal" in the spawn protocol. `BUGS` records it.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! **Finding a page is `apropos`'s job, not this program's** (milestone 40 phase 2). That split is
//! the same one Unix makes between `man` and `apropos`, and here it is a capability split too: a
//! search has to read the store's index, so it is a shell builtin, and what it hands back is a
//! *name* this program never sees.
//!
//! ```text
//! $ apropos capability
//!     32  doc/swish/pipes.md            Pipes and redirection: `>`, `<` and `|` are one
//!     11  doc/kernel/ipc-naming.md      Who does IPC name?
//! ```
//!
//! And what a reader then types, with the one limitation `BUGS` explains under it:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ doc gate.txt | wc
//!   1 4 26
//! $ doc gate.txt
//!   hello world hello world
//! $ doc
//!   doc: reads an input stream: name a file, redirect with '<', or pipe into it
//! ```
//!
//! `gate.txt` is two lines, four words, twenty-four bytes; what comes back is one line, four words,
//! twenty-six, because two source lines are one paragraph re-flowed and the two bytes are the body
//! indent. Those three lines are `script/shell-check`'s, on both architectures.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **`doc <page>` on its own used to be refused at the prompt; DECISIONS §106 (2026-08-22)
//!   closed it and it now renders.** This entry described the refusal, and before that a
//!   deadlock, for weeks after each stopped being true, which is the exact failure this section
//!   exists to avoid: name the limitation where the reader meets the feature, not somewhere they
//!   have to already know to look. The mechanism is `terminal_sink_caretaker`, the same sink
//!   adapter a declared second stream already reached by default under DECISIONS §67, now the
//!   default primary-output target for an unredirected tail stage too. `doc <page> > out.txt`
//!   (the redirected shape, with nowhere for the shell to wait but itself) is still refused, and
//!   still names the fix ('| wc' or similar). See notes/manual.md's "Render a page at the prompt"
//!   section and notes/pipes.md for the full mechanism and the fault-endpoint-reuse race it
//!   accepts.
//! - **`doc <page> | wc` and `doc <page> > out.txt` do deliver the named file.** They answered
//!   `0 0 0` when this program shipped, because a pipeline's head was wired off the `Line`, which
//!   carries no `<`; the planner's input operand is what the shell reads now. `script/shell-check`
//!   types `doc gate.txt | wc` on both architectures and asserts `1 4 26` against `gate.txt`'s
//!   `2 4 24`: two source lines re-flowed into one, plus two bytes of body indent, which is what
//!   separates a rendered page from silence.
//! - **No pager, and the reason is authority rather than effort.** Paging needs a keypress, a
//!   keypress needs `line_editor::proto::OP_READLINE`, and that opcode rides on the terminal
//!   endpoint whose read side *is* the keyboard. The spawn protocol has no way to hand a child the
//!   right to read one line without handing it the terminal, which is the exact thing
//!   `terminal_sink_caretaker` exists to prevent. So a long page scrolls off, and the fix is a
//!   design decision about the spawn protocol rather than a hundred lines here.
//! - **Eighty columns, always.** The renderer takes a width and this program does not ask for one,
//!   because there is nobody to ask: the terminal contract has no "how wide are you" verb, and the
//!   graphical terminal is 32 columns while the serial one is whatever the host window is.
//! - **Plain text only**, per the section above.
//! - **A source line longer than `manual::LINE_MAX` loses its tail**, and this program does not say
//!   so even though `manual::Renderer::truncated` would tell it, because its only output channel is
//!   the rendered document and a diagnostic in the middle of one is worse than the loss.
