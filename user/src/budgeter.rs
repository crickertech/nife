//! The budgeter: a program that spends exactly the memory it was granted, and reports how much.
//!
//! Milestone 31 phase 1. This is what makes `run --mem N budgeter` *real* rather than
//! parsed-and-ignored. The shell splits `N` pages off its own untyped budget and delegates that
//! untyped to this program (init inserts it at slot 1); the program then maps pages out of it, one
//! at a time, until the budget is exhausted, and reports the count on its result endpoint (slot 0).
//!
//! The number it reports *is* the authority the command line handed it. Grant more, it maps more;
//! grant nothing, and it holds no untyped at slot 1 at all, so its very first `MAP` returns
//! `NoSuchSlot` and it reports zero. There is no ambient pool to fall back on: a nife process
//! spends the budget it was given and not one page more.
//!
//! One honest detail, recorded rather than hidden: an `N`-page untyped does not yield `N` mapped
//! data pages. Reaching a fresh virtual address needs page-table pages, and those come from the
//! same untyped (the kernel allocates nothing on a process's behalf, DECISIONS §10). So the
//! reported count is `N` minus the handful of pages the tables cost. That the count tracks `N`, and
//! collapses to zero with no grant, is the proof the budget is real.
//!
//! # The budgeter's world
//!
//! - slot 0: the result endpoint (SEND: report the page count).
//! - slot 1: an untyped budget (the delegated `--mem` grant). Absent when `--mem` was 0.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-07-28 with the grant expression. It is an agent noun in the
//! `broker`/`spawner`/`painter` family milestone 63 later named as a family, but nothing records
//! the choice.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
