//! The virtio-blk driver as its own binary (parity C).
//!
//! On aarch64 the block driver is a *role* of the PL011-wired `hello` multiplexer (milestone 9
//! predates the dedicated-binary split). This is its portable analog, the 19f pattern: the whole
//! driver logic is the shared `virtio` module, and this file is only the skeleton a dedicated
//! binary needs (an `_start` that dispatches the role, a panic handler, the runtime re-exports).
//! The kernel's `virtio_service` spawns it with the same role numbers and the same capability
//! slots as hello's roles, so the kernel side is byte-identical across the two shapes.
//!
//! The three roles are the honest driver and the two attackers the DMA-confinement tests spawn
//! (a descriptor aimed at kernel memory, and the indirect-descriptor escape). The attackers ride
//! in the same binary for the same reason they ride in hello: they differ from the honest driver
//! by one descriptor, and sharing the setup code is what makes the attack a fair test.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-27 (calef). Renamed from `blk` to `block_driver`, matching the
//! `<device>_driver` shape given to `gpu_driver` and `keyboard_driver` in the same pass. Not
//! `disk_driver`: virtio-blk operates on the block-device abstraction, which is medium-agnostic
//! (RAM-backed, network-backed and virtual block devices are all real, not just physical disks),
//! so `block` is the accurate term and `disk` would be a narrower, slightly false claim. `blk`
//! itself was ratified 2026-07-30 (DECISIONS §39) as an abbreviation that was the ordinary name
//! of the thing; this supersedes that entry with the fuller, consistent name.

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
