//! **The net server: smoltcp as a userspace TCP/IP stack over the confined NIC** (milestone 30,
//! piece 3).
//!
//! The networking form of the userspace-reuse thesis: the kernel confines the NIC's DMA (pieces 1
//! and 2), and a real, reused TCP/IP stack (smoltcp, not hand-built) runs it entirely at EL0. The
//! kernel knows nothing about TCP, UDP, or DHCP; it owns only the DMA confinement.
//!
//! `net_stack` brings the NIC up, runs DHCP to completion (reporting the lease), then serves a
//! capability-shaped socket contract on a `Stack` endpoint (DECISIONS §25, notes/net.md,
//! `crates/socket_proto/src/lib.rs)`: a socket is a socket id, per-connection bytes cross in a shared frame the
//! client delegates, and every operation is one message. Phase one is single-threaded and
//! synchronous, one exchange per request; the server blocks on the `Stack` endpoint between
//! requests and drives the network inside handling one.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//! - slot 0: the report endpoint (WRITE) for the DHCP lease
//! - slot 1: the NIC interrupt (WAIT / ACK)
//! - slot 2: the confined `Virtio` transport
//! - slot 3: an untyped budget, for the heap and for mapping clients' shared frames
//! - slot 4: the `Stack` endpoint (READ), where clients' requests arrive
//! - arg1: the DMA page's physical address
//! - arg2: the **grant word**: the TCP listen range (milestone 107) in its low half and the
//!   fixed-UDP bind range (milestone 55's mDNS stack half) in its high half, both packed by
//!   `socket_proto`. Zero, the default, means no port anywhere in either protocol: a stack serves
//!   inbound connections, or claims a fixed UDP port, only when whoever spawned it said which.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-07-30 (calef, DECISIONS §39, landed by milestone 46), replacing `netd`, and
//! respelled from `netstack` on 2026-08-01 (milestone 63) because `net` is already this tree's word
//! and the two halves are separate concepts. Refused `netd`, the name DECISIONS §39 was written
//! about: it holds five explicit capabilities, cannot name its own callers, is supervised, and can
//! be reaped by something that lacks the authority to build it, which is about as far from the
//! model that suffix claims as a long-running process gets.

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks

/// and the exchange is waiting on one of those timers (a segment we must retransmit because its ACK
/// was dropped), no RX interrupt is coming (the peer is waiting for that retransmit), so the block
/// never returns and the whole pipeline deadlocks with every core idle. aarch64 happened never to
/// drop a segment and so never hit it; riscv under the SMP scatter did. See notes/net.md.
///
/// So: ask smoltcp when it next needs to run. When it has **no** timer pending (`poll_delay` is
/// `None`), block on the interrupt, which is the common, efficient case (0% CPU until a frame
/// arrives), and correct, because with nothing of our own to send we are purely waiting on the peer,
/// whose own retransmit will wake us. When it **does** have a timer pending, do not block: yield and
/// let the caller re-`poll`, so the timer actually fires. That confines the busy interval to the
