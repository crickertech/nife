//! **The system builder: userspace init for the interactive shell** (parity D), on riscv64.
//!
//! The portable counterpart of hello's `init_boot` role (which is aarch64-wired only by living
//! inside the PL011-tied `hello`). The kernel loads this as the boot process, maps the initrd, and
//! grants it the capabilities [`GRANTS`] names below. From those, and nothing else, it builds the
//! whole interactive system out of its own budget: the console server, the input driver, the line
//! discipline, the shell, the terminal's sink adapter and the job undertaker, wired together with
//! endpoints and shared pages it creates. Then it stays alive as the spawn service.
//!
//! **All of that is `crates/system_initializer` now** (milestone 96), and so is the reasoning: what init
//! gives away once the system is up, why the job pool is bounded, and the honest limits (LIFO
//! recovery, the retained scratch mappings, the sixteen-slot cspace). This file is the boot entry
//! and the one thing the two boards genuinely disagree about, which is the order their kernels grant
//! capabilities in.
//!
//! The duplication that ended here was expensive rather than untidy. `user::initrd()` loads the
//! archive entry `init`, which is `user/src/hello.rs`'s `init_boot` role on aarch64 and this program
//! on riscv64, and the construction and the spawn service were written once in each: a fix that
//! landed in one and not the other presented as a boot that reached userspace and printed nothing at
//! all, with no fault and no message. `script/shell-check` runs both, which is what makes it the
//! gate for this file.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `sysinit`. Refused `sysinit`
//! (squished), `system_builder` (`user/src/builder.rs` already calls itself "the system builder",
//! so two programs would claim one phrase), `session_initializer` (squats milestone 49's
//! vocabulary, since sessions arrive with users and login and this program manages neither) and
//! `shell_init` (refused on evidence: it looks the shell up **by name in the initrd**, so it brings
//! up whatever is packed as `shell` rather than `swish` specifically, and it stays alive as the
//! spawn service, which is not a shell concern at all).

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
