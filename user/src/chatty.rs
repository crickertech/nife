//! **The client that does not notice, and the attacker that cannot** (milestone 23, DECISIONS §41).
//!
//! One binary, two roles, because an attacker that holds the honest client's own capabilities is a
//! fair test of the boundary rather than a different program failing for its own reasons.
//!
//! # The client (`ROLE_CLIENT`)
//!
//! It calls a stable endpoint sixty-four times in a loop and checks every answer. It holds one
//! capability to that endpoint for its whole life, it never reconnects, it never retries, and it
//! has no code path for "the server went away", because there is no such event to have a path for.
//! Somewhere in the middle of that loop the server is torn down and a different program, written in
//! a different language, takes its place.
//!
//! **It is its own witness.** The verdict it reports is computed here, from what it observed:
//! every call returned, every reply echoed the sequence number that asked for it, every digest
//! matched this program's own independent computation, and the version word went up exactly once.
//! The operator has a second, independent witness (the shared log page, in the operator's address
//! space); neither is taken on the other's word, which is the shape milestones 29, 33 and 36 used.
//!
//! What it *cannot* claim, stated plainly: the client does observe the version word change, so it
//! is not blind to the swap. The claim is that its stream was unbroken, not that a swap is
//! undetectable by a client that goes looking for one.
//!
//! # The attacker (`ROLE_USURPER`)
//!
//! It is endowed with exactly the client's capabilities, including a real, working capability to
//! the stable endpoint. If endpoint-only naming meant "whoever holds the endpoint is the server",
//! it would be able to park itself in `RECV_CAP` and take the client's requests. It cannot: its
//! capability carries `WRITE` and not `READ`, and the same object handed out with different rights
//! is a one-way pipe in whichever direction each holder was trusted with. It reports the refusal.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-07-30 with milestone 23's live replacement, as a fixture
//! rather than a component.
