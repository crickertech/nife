//! **The timetable: scheduled execution where every entry is a grant** (milestone 129).
//!
//! A cron, and the inversion of one. Unix cron reads a text file and runs arbitrary commands as
//! ambient authority made periodic: whatever the crontab says happens, with the account's whole
//! reach behind it, and the crontab is therefore the attack surface. This reads a text file too and
//! the file looks similar, but an entry's command is a **grant expression** checked at registration
//! by `grant_plan::plan`, the same function the shell checks a prompt line with. What a scheduled
//! child holds is planned, printed, and fixed before the first tick.
//!
//! **The claim, in one sentence:** compromising this process yields the entries' summed endowments,
//! not the system, because there is no ambient authority for a scheduled child to fall back on and
//! this process holds nothing it was not handed.
//!
//! # What it holds, and that is the whole list
//!
//! - slot 0: the output endpoint (WRITE). Where the plan and the summary go, as `sink_proto` bytes.
//! - slot 1: an untyped budget (WRITE). What every instance is made of, and what pays for the
//!   loader's own scratch mappings.
//! - slot 2: the child report endpoint (WRITE|GRANT), handed to each instance as its slot 0.
//! - slot 3: the supervision endpoint (READ|GRANT), placed in each instance's reserved fault slot
//!   so every scheduled child is born supervised (DECISIONS §26), and invoked with
//!   `Rendezvous::REAP` to collect the corpses (§32).
//! - `a0`: how many fires to perform before summarising and exiting. `0` means forever.
//! - `a1`: the length of the archive the spawn site mapped read-only at [`INITRD_VA`]. **Not the
//!   initrd**: it holds exactly the programs this document will ever build, because the plan is
//!   computable before the first tick and so the endowment can be narrowed to it. This process
//!   audits that and says what it found, in the line after the plan.
//!
//! **It wants a bigger stack than a small program does**, and a spawn site has to say so: a
//! `grant_plan::Endowment` is about a kilobyte (mostly the name set a directory grant can carry) and
//! the plan holds one per entry, so the working set is tens of kilobytes rather than hundreds of
//! bytes. `kernel/src/user/timetable_tests.rs` maps 32 pages and says why; eight died with a data
//! abort whose faulting address was the stack pointer, which is what a stack overflow looks like
//! from the kernel side and reads like a wild pointer if you have not seen it before.
//!
//! **And nothing else.** No clock page, no directory, no console, no network, no device. That list
//! is not modesty: it is why a scheduled `date` in `timetable.conf` is refused at registration
//! rather than run, and why the refusal names the timetable rather than the line.
//!
//! # The archive is narrowed to the plan, and this process says so
//!
//! `Registry::programs` is the complete set of programs the document will ever start, and it is
//! known before anything fires. So the spawn site builds an archive of exactly that set and hands
//! *that* over, rather than the initrd: after milestone 129's second stratum this process cannot
//! load `date`, `ps`, `swish` or anything else it will never run, even though it holds a working
//! image loader.
//!
//! It cannot narrow its own endowment, so what it does instead is **measure it** and print the
//! answer next to the plan (`timetable::Audit`). A scheduler handed the whole initrd still works
//! and says a different sentence, which is the property worth having: the width of the endowment is
//! a line on the console rather than a fact only the spawn site knows.
//!
//! # The loop, and the one thing it cannot do
//!
//! Poll the monotonic counter (ambient, `user_rt::monotonic_nanos`, no capability); fire what is
//! due; when the budget cannot back another instance, block on the supervision endpoint until a
//! corpse arrives and reclaim its region. That last step is the only blocking wait in the program,
//! which matters because **this kernel has exactly one wait point per process and no timed wait at
//! all** (milestone 106 is `NOT-STARTED` and gated on a decision). See `BUGS`.
//!
//! Name: provisional, along with `crates/timetable` and `user/timetable.conf`. Milestone 129's own
//! block declines to propose a name and says the eventual one is calef's; see the crate's module
//! doc for what was refused and why.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **It spins between fires, and that is a missing kernel primitive rather than a lazy loop.**
//!   There is no sleep, no timeout and no deadline anywhere in this kernel, so a process that wants
//!   to act at a time can only yield and re-read the counter. `Registry::next_deadline` already
//!   computes exactly what a timed wait would block until, so the fix is one line here once
//!   milestone 106's fork is decided; until then a running timetable costs a core's worth of yields.
//!   **This program is that fork's fifth consumer** (the block counts four: `net_stack`'s retransmit
//!   window, milestone 51's `thread::sleep`, `RECV`'s no-timeout limitation, and the shell's `^C`
//!   poll), and it is the first one whose *whole purpose* is to act at a time.
//!
//! - **Corpses are collected lazily, when their memory is needed.** Nothing reaps between fires,
//!   because reaping means blocking on the supervision endpoint and blocking means not watching the
//!   clock. So the failure counts this program reports lag reality until the budget runs down.
//!   A wait that returns on either a message or a deadline fixes this too, and it is the same fork.
//!
//! - **A hung scheduled child stops the whole timetable.** When the budget cannot back another
//!   instance the loop blocks on the supervision endpoint, and a livelocked child never sends a
//!   death message, so nothing arrives and nothing else fires. That is §32's watchdog case verbatim
//!   (`Rendezvous::REAP` collects corpses and refuses to kill, deliberately) and it is not this
//!   program's to fix: it waits for milestone 23. What it costs here is worth stating, because it is
//!   worse than it is for a shell: at a prompt the person who typed the command is sitting there and
//!   can press `^C`, and behind a schedule there is nobody.
//!
//! - **The narrowing is to the plan, not to one image per entry.** `user/src/spawner.rs` is handed
//!   a single image and "build me program X" is not a thing that can be asked of it; this is handed
//!   an archive and can still name anything in it. The residual is therefore the *union* of the
//!   plan's programs rather than one program per entry, so a document admitting three programs
//!   leaves an instance of one able to reach the other two's images. Closing that needs a
//!   capability per entry rather than one per timetable, which is a shape this tree does not have.
//!
//! - **`--mem` entries are refused**, and the mechanism the roadmap sketched for backing one does
//!   not work. `Held::mem_pages` is zero, so an entry naming a memory grant is `Unbacked::Memory`
//!   even though this process holds a budget.
//!
//!   The sketch said to split the grant out of the instance's own region "so a single `DESTROY`
//!   still reclaims both". **The kernel refuses exactly that**: `memory_regions::destroy_outcome` returns
//!   `Refused` for any region with a live child, Kani proves it, and `sched::reap_supervised` hands
//!   that refusal straight back, so a corpse whose region carries a split grant can never be
//!   collected until the grant is destroyed first.
//!
//!   What the nesting *does* buy is the only correlation available, which is why it is still the
//!   right shape: a refused reap names the instance that carried a grant. Nothing here can pair a
//!   death with a grant otherwise, because a builder is never told its child's tid
//!   (`supervision_proto::build_child` hands back a TCB capability, and `abi::tcb` has no method
//!   that reads one out), so the only fact a supervisor has about a death is the tid the kernel
//!   stamped on it. What remains is therefore a decision rather than wiring: **how many `--mem`
//!   instances may be outstanding at once**, since the refusal only identifies one. `crates/timetable`
//!   already plans and refuses memory grants against `Held::mem_pages`, and its host tests cover it.
//!
//! - **Nothing is persistent.** Entries live in a document compiled into this binary, and both die
//!   with the boot. Milestone 129's block records this and points at whatever milestone gives
//!   services durable configuration at all, which does not exist yet.
//!
//! - **The document is compiled in, not read from disk.** `include_str!`, exactly as
//!   `user/src/mdns_responder.rs` does and for the same reason: reading a file needs a file
//!   capability wired through the spawn. The format, the parser, the line-numbered errors and every
//!   test are unaffected by where the bytes come from.
