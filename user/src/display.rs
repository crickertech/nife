//! **The display driver: virtio-gpu, at EL0, confined** (milestone 29, the display ladder's rung
//! one).
//!
//! The first pixels this system ever puts in a scanout, put there by an unprivileged process whose
//! whole world is a cspace:
//!
//! - slot 0, a **report** endpoint: how it tells its spawner it came up, and what it flushed;
//! - slot 1, an **`Irq`**: the device's completion interrupt, arriving as a message;
//! - slot 2, a **`Virtio`**: the confined transport. The device's registers are NOT mapped here, so
//!   this process cannot program a queue address or ring a doorbell; the kernel does both, and
//!   validates every descriptor first (notes/dma.md);
//! - slot 3, a **display** endpoint it RECVs on: where clients ask for a flush;
//! - slot 4, an **untyped**: the budget the page tables for its own mappings come out of;
//! - slots 5.., its **DMA region**: [`DMA_FRAMES`] `Frame` capabilities, one per page, which it maps
//!   itself (milestone 108). The region's *physical* base still arrives in `x1`, because descriptors
//!   speak physical addresses and a process only knows virtual ones.
//!
//! **Nine capabilities for one contiguous region** is the shape a `Frame` forces, and it is worth
//! seeing: this driver spends nine of the fourteen usable slots in its cspace naming pages that are
//! adjacent in physics, adjacent in its address space, and covered as a single range by the IOMMU
//! domain the kernel programmed. See notes/frames.md's BUGS.
//!
//! # The thing that draws is not the thing that talks to the hardware
//!
//! This process never draws a pixel. It owns the device and the transport, and it serves a
//! contract ([`graphics_proto`], notes/framebuffer-contract.md) to a client that owns the pixels and no
//! device at all. That split is the whole point of the increment: rung two's compositor takes the
//! client's place unchanged, and the security story is that a hostile client can draw nonsense and
//! nothing more.
//!
//! # The memory story, because a framebuffer does not fit in a page
//!
//! Every other driver here gets one 4 KiB DMA page. A framebuffer does not fit in one, and the
//! tempting shortcut, letting the GPU's backing live outside the DMA region, would put the one
//! device that reads bulk memory outside the confinement everything else is inside. So the region is
//! **larger**, not special: page 0 holds the rings and the control request/response buffers (driver
//! private), and pages 1.. hold the surface, which is the run of frames the client also maps. The
//! kernel registers the whole run as this driver's DMA region, so the shadow-ring validator bounds
//! every descriptor to it and the IOMMU domain covers exactly it. See notes/framebuffer-contract.md.
//!
//! # What this driver does NOT do
//!
//! No fonts, no VT state, no scrollback, no input. Those are later increments and they arrive as
//! *clients* of the contract this serves, not as code in here.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-07-30 (calef, DECISIONS §39, landed by milestone 46), replacing `gpud`.
//! Refused `gpud` (the `-d` claim).

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
