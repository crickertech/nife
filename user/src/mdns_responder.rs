//! **The mDNS responder** (milestone 55): what makes this machine appear in a Mac's Time Machine
//! list at all.
//!
//! A Mac does not browse SMB shares to find a backup destination; it asks multicast DNS, and it
//! offers only what answers. So this program is the difference between a working file service
//! nobody can find and a server that shows up in the UI. It is small on purpose: **every decision
//! about what to say is `mdns_proto`'s** (host-tested against real bytes from the reference router,
//! Kani-checked at the parser), **everything it says is `mdns_config`'s** (a document a person
//! edits), and what is left here is the IO. Bind the port, receive, decide, send.
//!
//! # What it does, in order
//!
//! 1. Parses its configuration document. A mistake in it stops the program with the line number,
//!    rather than putting a half-formed advertisement on the network.
//! 2. Claims UDP 5353 through the socket contract's `BIND_UDP`, which is an **authority it was
//!    granted** rather than a port it took: the spawn site packs the range with
//!    `socket_proto::udp_bind_grant`, and a responder spawned without it is refused (see
//!    notes/mdns.md).
//! 3. **Announces** all three service types (RFC 6762 §8.3), so a Mac already browsing learns about
//!    this machine without waiting to ask again.
//! 4. Answers queries until it has served `arg0` of them, or forever when that is zero. Each answer
//!    is one `mdns_proto::respond` call: multicast queries are answered to the group, legacy
//!    queriers (a source port that is not 5353) get a unicast response with the ID echoed and the
//!    TTLs capped, which is RFC 6762 §6.7 and is why the socket contract reports a datagram's
//!    source endpoint at all.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//! - slot 0: the report endpoint (WRITE)
//! - slot 1: the `Stack` endpoint (WRITE), shared with the stack's other clients
//! - slot 2: an untyped budget (to mint and delegate the shared frame)
//! - arg0: queries to answer before reporting OK; 0 means serve forever
//! - arg1: the IPv4 address this machine holds, as the DHCP lease reported it (`u32` of the
//!   octets, big-endian, 0 for "not known"). **Not configuration**: which address a machine has is
//!   a run-time fact, so whoever knows it passes it in, and with 0 the responder simply announces
//!   no A record.
//!
//! And **nothing else**, which is the point worth reading twice. This program holds no filesystem,
//! no disk, no console, and no listening TCP port. It cannot serve a file, cannot read one, and
//! cannot be talked into either: the SMB share it advertises is a *different* process holding a
//! *different* capability. Discovery and service are separate authorities here, and on the
//! reference implementation (one Samba, one config file, `vfs_fruit` plus Avahi in the same trust
//! domain) they are not.
//!
//! # Socket ids
//!
//! Sid 4, not 0. A stack endpoint's socket table is per-endpoint (`socket_proto`'s BUGS: clients
//! sharing an endpoint are indistinguishable to the server), and in the combined gate this program
//! shares one with `socket_test_client` (ids 0 and 1) and `smb_server` (2 and 3).
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The configuration is compiled in, not read from a file.** `mdns_config`'s document is
//!   `include_str!`d here, so changing what this machine advertises means a rebuild. The reason is
//!   that reading a file needs a file capability wired through the spawn and a fixture the QEMU
//!   gate cannot seed today, and the fix is a `FileSpec` grant plus an `filesystem_proto` open-and-read at
//!   startup. Nothing about the format or the parser changes when that lands.
//! - **One announcement, not the RFC's two to eight.** RFC 6762 §8.3 asks for repeats at doubling
//!   intervals, so a Mac that missed the first datagram waits until its next browse rather than
//!   hearing us again. The repeats need a timer this program does not hold.
//! - **No probing.** RFC 6762 §8 says claim a name only after probing for a conflict, and
//!   `mdns_proto` has the wire halves (`probe_query`, `conflicts`, `tiebreak`) ready. This
//!   responder announces straight away, so two nife machines with the same `host` in one
//!   configuration would fight over the name and neither would notice.
//! - **A response larger than [`RESPONSE_MAX`] is not sent at all.** A query that asks for
//!   everything at once (`ANY` on the enumeration name, say) can compose a response past the
//!   transport's MTU, and this program stays silent rather than sending a datagram the 576-byte
//!   MTU would drop. RFC 6762's answer is the TC bit and a follow-up message, which `mdns_proto`
//!   does not implement either.
//! - **It never leaves.** A responder that stops should send goodbye records (TTL 0) so caches
//!   drop it immediately; this one exits after its rounds and its records age out on their own.
//! - **IPv4 only.** No AAAA, so a Mac on an IPv6-only segment finds nothing. `mdns_proto`'s
//!   `Advertisement` carries no IPv6 address yet.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded, and explicitly **provisional**, minted by milestone 55's responder lane on
//! 2026-08-16. `mdns_responder` is what macOS calls its own service (`mDNSResponder`), which is
//! the argument for it (a reader knows what it does before reading a word) and against it (it is
//! somebody else's product name, and this tree's `net_stack` deliberately does not spell itself
//! `netd`). Not put to calef.
