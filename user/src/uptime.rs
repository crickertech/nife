//! **`uptime`**: print how long the machine has been counting (milestone 126,
//! design/roadmap/126-who-else-is-running.md, notes/process-view.md).
//!
//! The whole program is: read the ambient monotonic counter, hand the nanoseconds to
//! [`uptime::format`], send the bytes. It holds one capability (the output sink) and cannot
//! change anything.
//!
//! # It needed no new capability, and that is the finding worth stating
//!
//! Milestone 126's own BUGS section named `free`, `uptime` and `vmstat` together as "machine
//! statistics rather than process enumeration," on the assumption all three want kernel-side
//! accounting nothing exposes today. `uptime` turned out not to: [`user_rt::monotonic_nanos`] is
//! the same counter `date` already reads, granted to **every** process unconditionally
//! (`kernel/src/arch/*/timer.rs`'s documented, deliberate exception to DECISIONS §10's
//! no-ambient-authority rule). So this program's manifest is `worker`'s, not `date`'s: no memory,
//! no file, no clock capability, no domain, nothing but the report channel every spawn carries.
//! `free` and `vmstat` are a different body of work; see the roadmap doc's fork write-up for why.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//!
//! | slot | what | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | the output sink, `WRITE` | where the one line goes |
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//! $ uptime
//! up 00:12:34
//! $ uptime > when.txt
//! $ caps uptime
//!   uptime would grant the new process, and nothing else:
//!     cap 0  endpoint  result   report its answer back
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! See `crates/uptime`'s module docs: no load average, no logged-in-user count, one-second
//! resolution, and the counter's own zero predates this kernel's init by an unmeasured amount.
//!
//! Name: provisional. See `crates/uptime`'s module docs for the argument.

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
