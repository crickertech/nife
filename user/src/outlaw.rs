//! **The outlaw: the two programs the privilege-boundary tests need, and nothing else wants.**
//!
//! Both of these used to be aarch64 machine code assembled inline in `kernel/src/user.rs` (the
//! `user_program!` macro, milestone 7a). That was fine while there was one instruction set. It
//! stopped being fine when there were two: porting `kernel::user::tests` to RISC-V that way meant
//! hand-assembling every one of them a second time, for no new coverage of anything portable.
//!
//! So they are a real ELF now, built by the ordinary toolchain for whichever target is being built,
//! and the kernel loads them the way it loads any other program. The tests that drive them are the
//! same tests on both ISAs.
//!
//! It is deliberately **not** a role of `hello`. hello is the system's init on aarch64 and carries
//! the roles a running system uses; these two exist only to be killed or to be counted, and a
//! process that reads a forbidden address on purpose has no business sharing an image with init.
//! Keeping it separate also keeps it tiny, which the frame-accounting test cares about: it spawns
//! this program five times and asserts every frame comes back exactly.
//!
//! Name: provisional, and ruled: calef ruled **`kernel_test_subject`** on 2026-09-13, working the
//! unratified worklist. The block stays `provisional` because the ratified name is not this file's
//! until the rename is performed, which waits on milestone 175 moving this file and travels with
//! `flaky`'s and `chatty`'s sweep. Introduced 2026-07-31 as the fixture that does what it is not
//! permitted to do, so the kernel's refusal has a witness.
//!
//! **This block used to defend `outlaw` with an argument its own code refutes**, and the refutation
//! is why the name went. It claimed the metaphor "generalises correctly: the file already holds two
//! roles and would hold a third without the name going stale." It does not generalise over the two
//! roles it already has. `READ_KERNEL` reads a kernel address from EL0, faults, and is killed: an
//! outlaw. `ROUND_TRIP` yields twice and exits cleanly, breaking no rule at all, and exists so the
//! frame-accounting test can spawn it five times and assert every frame comes back, and so
//! `no_leaked_threads` has something to watch. The header says it three lines up without noticing:
//! these two exist "only to be killed or to be counted". Killed is the outlaw; counted is not.
//!
//! `kernel_test_subject` names what both roles share: a subject is what a test is performed *on*,
//! and these are minimal disposable processes `kernel::user::tests` spawns directly, that no
//! running system wants, and that are deliberately not roles of `hello` because init has no
//! business sharing an image with a program that faults on purpose.
//!
//! Refused `kernel_user_tests` (calef's, withdrawn): it collides with `kernel/src/user/tests.rs`,
//! the module that drives this program, so it names the caller rather than the subject; that
//! module also drives `hello`, `flaky` and `worker`, so the name would be equally true of four
//! programs and distinguish none; and it is plural where every other program here is one thing.
//! Refused `kernel_test_target` (calef's, withdrawn): this program **is** a Cargo target, a
//! `[[bin]]` in the fixtures manifest, and `target` is the most overloaded word in this tree
//! (1,823 occurrences; AGENTS.md alone uses it for architectures, Cargo targets and `#[path]`
//! targets), so a Rust reader reaches for the build-target meaning first. Refused
//! `privilege_boundary_subject` for the same fault as `outlaw`, since `ROUND_TRIP` serves frame
//! accounting rather than the privilege boundary. Refused `kernel_test_fixture`: once 175 lands
//! this file is in `fixtures/`, so the directory already says fixture. Refused
//! `kernel_address_reader`, this block's own straw man, and it was right that this one goes stale
//! the moment a second violation is added.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
