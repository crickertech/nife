//! **The sink contract's ends, in one binary** (milestone 50, notes/sink-protocol.md).
//!
//! Three roles, chosen by `arg0` at START. Two of them are the two sides of `byte_sink_proto` and the
//! third reads back what the second one wrote.
//!
//! # `ROLE_FILE`: a file behind a sink
//!
//! The `fs_file_caretaker` shape, one contract further out. `fs_file_caretaker` is a caretaker
//! because it "serves the same `filesystem_proto` protocol its own client speaks"; this one serves a
//! *different* and much smaller protocol than it speaks, and that asymmetry is the point. It holds
//! an FS-service endpoint, which is a directory capability: it can open names, read them, write at
//! arbitrary offsets, truncate, and stat. Its client holds an endpoint to this process, over which
//! the only expressible request is *here are up to sixteen bytes, append them*.
//!
//! So `> report.txt` grants strictly less than Unix's fd 1 does, and it is structural rather than
//! policy: the confined program cannot seek, cannot truncate, cannot re-read and cannot stat,
//! because there is no message that says any of those things and nothing in its cspace that names
//! the FS server. That is milestone 50's claim, and this file is where it is either true or not.
//!
//! # `ROLE_WRITER`: a program that does not know what it is writing to
//!
//! It writes [`byte_sink_proto::fixture::TRANSCRIPT`] to whatever is in slot 0 and reports how the last
//! `SEND` classified. Its whole job is to make the classification assertable **by value**, because
//! "gone" and "never had one" are two numbers and a test that could not tell them apart would not
//! be testing milestone 50's one behaviour change.
//!
//! # `ROLE_VERIFY`: the read-back
//!
//! Opens the file `ROLE_FILE` wrote and streams its contents out **over the sink contract**, which
//! is a small piece of evidence in itself: the same sixteen-byte framing carries a file's contents
//! as carried a program's `println!`.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//!
//! Slot 0 is the byte sink in every role, which is the convention the whole milestone is about:
//! `WRITE` when this process is the writer, `READ` when it is the sink.
//!
//! | | slot 0 | slot 1 | slot 2 | [`PAGE_VA`] |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | `ROLE_WRITER` | the sink, `WRITE` | report, `WRITE` | | |
//! | `ROLE_FILE` | the sink, `READ` | FS service, `WRITE` | report, `WRITE` | shared with the FS server |
//! | `ROLE_VERIFY` | the sink, `WRITE` | FS service, `WRITE` | report, `WRITE` | shared with the FS server |
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-07-31 with the sink contract (DECISIONS §51), taking the
//! contract's own word.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
