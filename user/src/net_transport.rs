//! A virtio-net transport for smoltcp, at EL0, behind the multi-queue DMA confinement.
//!
//! This is the driver half of the net server (milestone 30, piece 3): it brings the NIC up through
//! the confined `Virtio` capability, manages the receive and transmit rings, and presents smoltcp's
//! `phy::Device` interface. smoltcp does the TCP/IP; this file only moves Ethernet frames across the
//! virtqueue, the same confinement the disk and the by-hand net driver use.
//!
//! Everything the device DMAs stays inside the one DMA page the spawn service maps, so the kernel's
//! validator confines it exactly as it does the disk. The page is small, so the MTU is small
//! (`MTU`); a demonstrator with a single-page DMA region cannot post full 1514-byte buffers, and
//! that is a recorded caveat, not a bug (see notes/net.md).
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `vnet`. Refused `vnet` (an
//! abbreviation) and `virtio_net` (`crates/virtio` also drives net, so the device-class name would
//! collide). Named for its role: the adapter that presents smoltcp's `phy::Device` so frames can
//! cross the virtqueue, which is a different job from the driver underneath. This file is a
//! single-consumer `#[path]` module rather than a `[[bin]]`, which is why rule 7's check leaves it
//! alone.
