//! **`line_editor`: the line discipline as a userspace component** (milestone 28).
//!
//! The layer Unix builds into the kernel as the tty line discipline is here a process. It sits
//! between the raw input driver and the application, and between the application and the console
//! server, on plain endpoints:
//!
//! ```text
//!   input driver ──OP_BYTES──►┌──────────┐──text──► console server ──► UART
//!                             │ line_editor │
//!        application ◄─lines──└──────────┘◄──OP_WRITE / OP_READLINE── application
//! ```
//!
//! Nobody in that picture knows what they are talking to. The input driver holds "an endpoint I
//! send wire bytes to"; the application holds "an endpoint that prints and reads lines"; the
//! console server holds "an endpoint requests arrive on". Rendezvous-only naming (notes/
//! ipc-naming.md) is what makes the discipline swappable: rewire the endpoints and no client can
//! tell, which is milestone 23's hot-swap claim in component form.
//!
//! The IPC protocol is the terminal contract, notes/terminal-contract.md; the framing constants
//! are `line_editor::proto`. Every request is a `CALL`, served through `RECV_CAP`, answered through
//! the kernel's one-shot Reply capability (DECISIONS §12). That choice is what makes the server
//! deadlock-free: a READLINE with no line ready is *held* (the reply capability parked in a
//! slot) while the server keeps serving, so a client blocked printing can never interlock with
//! a server blocked delivering. The editing itself lives in the host-tested `line_editor` crate;
//! this file is only wiring: words in, pages copied, words out.
//!
//! Its whole authority: the terminal endpoint (slot 0, RECV), the console server's request and
//! reply endpoints (slots 1 and 2), the console's shared page (write), the client's output page
//! (read) and input page (write). No UART, no interrupt: the discipline touches no hardware,
//! which is exactly why it did not exist until the drivers did.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-07-30 (calef, DECISIONS §39, landed by milestone 46) for the word and again
//! 2026-08-01 (milestone 63) for the spelling, replacing `termd` and then `lineedit`. Refused
//! `termd` (the `-d` claim) and `linedisc`, the correct Unix term of art, which is the second half
//! of §39: calef did not recognise the phrase, and he built this system, which is evidence about
//! the name rather than about him.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
