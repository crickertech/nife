//! **`line_editor`: the line discipline as a userspace component** (milestone 28).
//!
//! The layer Unix builds into the kernel as the tty line discipline is here a process. It sits
//! between the raw input driver and the application, and between the application and its output
//! sink, on plain endpoints:
//!
//! ```text
//!   MODE_CONSOLE (the plain-console boot):
//!   input driver ──OP_BYTES──►┌──────────┐──text──► console server ──► UART
//!                             │ line_editor │
//!        application ◄─lines──└──────────┘◄──OP_WRITE / OP_READLINE── application
//!
//!   MODE_DISPLAY (milestone 177, the graphical boot):
//!   kbd (direct) ──OP_BYTES──►┌──────────┐──OP_WRITE──► display_terminal
//!                             │ line_editor │
//!        application ◄─lines──└──────────┘◄──OP_WRITE / OP_READLINE── application
//! ```
//!
//! Nobody in that picture knows what they are talking to. The input driver holds "an endpoint I
//! send wire bytes to"; the application holds "an endpoint that prints and reads lines"; the
//! output sink holds "an endpoint requests arrive on". Rendezvous-only naming (notes/
//! ipc-naming.md) is what makes the discipline swappable: rewire the endpoints and no client can
//! tell, which is milestone 23's hot-swap claim in component form. Milestone 177 exercises that
//! claim on the output side for real: the same server, unchanged on its input side, prints through
//! `display_terminal`'s `OP_WRITE`/one-`CALL` contract instead of the console's bespoke two-endpoint
//! one, chosen at spawn by `mode` (see [`MODE_CONSOLE`]/[`MODE_DISPLAY`]) and nowhere else --
//! `Con::put` writes to the same page either way, because the wire shape only differs in
//! [`Con::flush`].
//!
//! The IPC protocol is the terminal contract, notes/terminal-contract.md; the framing constants
//! are `line_editor::proto`. Every request served here is a `CALL`, served through `RECV_CAP`,
//! answered through the kernel's one-shot Reply capability (DECISIONS §12). That choice is what
//! makes the server deadlock-free: a READLINE with no line ready is *held* (the reply capability
//! parked in a slot) while the server keeps serving, so a client blocked printing can never
//! interlock with a server blocked delivering. The editing itself lives in the host-tested
//! `line_editor` crate; this file is only wiring: words in, pages copied, words out.
//!
//! Its whole authority: the terminal endpoint (slot 0, RECV), the output sink's request endpoint
//! (slot 1: `CONREQ`/`SEND` in [`MODE_CONSOLE`], `display_terminal`'s served endpoint/`CALL` in
//! [`MODE_DISPLAY`]), the console server's reply endpoint (slot 2, [`MODE_CONSOLE`] only), the
//! output page shared with whichever sink this boot has (write), the client's output page (read)
//! and input page (write). No UART, no interrupt, no device of any kind: the discipline touches no
//! hardware, which is exactly why it did not exist until the drivers did and exactly why it did
//! not need to change to gain a second one.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-07-30 (calef, DECISIONS §39, landed by milestone 46) for the word and again
//! 2026-08-01 (milestone 63) for the spelling, replacing `termd` and then `lineedit`. Refused
//! `termd` (the `-d` claim) and `linedisc`, the correct Unix term of art, which is the second half
//! of §39: calef did not recognise the phrase, and he built this system, which is evidence about
//! the name rather than about him.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
