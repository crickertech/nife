//! **`ps`: who else is running, and who is allowed to ask** (milestone 126, notes/process-view.md).
//!
//! The whole program is: walk one supervision domain with `abi::endpoint::SURVEY`, then say what it
//! found on one stream and what went wrong on the other. The listing itself is `crates/ps`, which
//! runs on the host in milliseconds; what lives here is the syscall and the two sinks.
//!
//! Name: recorded (milestone 126, and notes/naming.md). `ps` is the name every reader already knows
//! from outside this project, which the naming tenet calls the best name available and not one to
//! spend a rename on: renaming a standard term costs a reader the recognition the whole tenet exists
//! to buy. The crate beside it shares the name deliberately, which is the crate-and-program pair the
//! same tenet describes, and `coremark`, `line_editor` and `compositor` already are. That rule plus
//! the standard term produces this name; calef ruled on the rules, and never on this program.
//!
//! # It cannot enumerate the machine, and that is the demonstration
//!
//! A Unix `ps` reads `/proc`, which is **ambient**. It needs no grant from anyone, so `ps aux`
//! prints every process on the box, including the command lines with secrets in `argv`. Nobody
//! defends that design; `hidepid` exists because enough people stopped wanting to live with it.
//!
//! This one holds a **supervision endpoint** and can see exactly the threads whose deaths arrive on
//! it. There is no `/proc` to open, no pid space to scan, and no syscall in this binary's reach that
//! takes a process id it was not handed. Run it and it lists the domain it was spawned into; it
//! cannot discover that any other domain exists, let alone read one.
//!
//! The wide grant is not forbidden, it is **nameable**. An operator's monitor over the whole machine
//! is a `ps` handed the endpoint that supervises the whole machine, and `caps ps` prints which one
//! this is. On Linux there is no such distinction to print, and that is the entire difference.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//!
//! | slot | what | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | the output sink, `WRITE` | where the table goes |
//! | 7 | the process domain, `ENUMERATE` | the supervision endpoint whose members it may **name** |
//! | 8 | the diagnostics sink, `WRITE` | where a refusal goes, so `>` cannot swallow it |
//!
//! Three capabilities, and **none of them names a process**. No memory grant, no file, no directory,
//! no clock: a snapshot of a domain needs no wall clock and no accounting, which is why `ps` is the
//! first of `procps` to be built and `top` is not.
//!
//! The domain sits in a slot the shell's grant plan **names** ([`DOMAIN_SLOT`]) rather than the next
//! free one, for the reason DECISIONS §67 gave the diagnostics slot the same treatment: how many low
//! slots a child gets depends on what else the command line granted it, and a program that probes a
//! fixed number needs that number not to move.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//! $ ps
//!          TID  STATE
//!            5  running
//!            9  blocked
//!
//! $ ps > running.txt      the table lands in the file
//! $ ps | wc               the table is counted, and no /proc was read to make it
//! ```
//!
//! And the case that has no Unix equivalent, because on Unix there is no domain to be outside of:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ ps        ps: this process holds no process-domain capability
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Holding the domain with `READ` was more authority than looking needs. Fixed 2026-08-17**, and
//!   the entry is kept because the shape recurs. `READ` on a supervision endpoint is also what `RECV`
//!   and `abi::endpoint::REAP` take, so a `ps` endowed a view could have taken a death message out
//!   from under the real supervisor or collected a corpse, and this binary's own source was the whole
//!   argument that it did not. `abi::rights::ENUMERATE` is the right it holds now, and the lane that
//!   deferred the fix was waiting on a decision the signalling stratum never needed: calef's ruling
//!   that a domain names its members and does not act on them abolished `pkill` rather than
//!   answering it. notes/process-view.md carries the argument.
//! - **The listing has no `CMD` column**, because a process here has no name (see `crates/ps`).
//! - **`pgrep` is this program filtered**, and it is granted the same three capabilities and not one
//!   right more (`crates/pgrep`, `user/src/pgrep.rs`). There is no `pkill` beside it and there cannot
//!   be, which is the whole point of the pair.
//! - **`ps` lists itself**, as `running`, because it is a member of the domain it was spawned into.
//!   That is truthful rather than a bug in the walk, and Unix's `ps` does the same; it is recorded
//!   because the first thing a reader counts is one more than they expected.
