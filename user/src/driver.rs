//! A userspace device driver: the interrupt-driven console input driver (milestone 20).
//!
//! This is the point of the whole interrupt story on RISC-V, and the demonstrator's thesis in one
//! small program: **a device driver is an unprivileged userspace process.** It holds no privilege at
//! all. Its entire authority is three things the kernel handed it: an `Irq` capability for the UART's
//! interrupt (slot 0), a report endpoint to send what it reads (slot 1), and a device-typed mapping
//! of the NS16550's registers at [`UART_VA`]. From those, and nothing else, it services the device.
//!
//! The loop is the seL4 `IRQHandler` protocol:
//!
//! 1. `WAIT` on the `Irq` capability. This blocks until the kernel delivers the UART interrupt as a
//!    message (the interrupt the driver owns by capability, not by privilege).
//! 2. Read the received byte straight from the UART's receive register, through the driver's own
//!    device mapping. The kernel never touches the byte; it is not in the data path.
//! 3. `SEND` the byte on the report endpoint, so whoever is watching sees it.
//! 4. `ACK` the `Irq` capability. The kernel masked the source when it fired; the ACK re-arms it
//!    (kernel side: `arch::irq::enable`, the PLIC on RISC-V, the GIC on aarch64) now that the device
//!    is quiet. Without this, the level-triggered UART would re-fire forever.
//!
//! Fully portable: it names no architecture. `user_rt` supplies the `ecall`/`svc` ABI, and the one
//! device-specific fact (the NS16550 register layout) is the driver's own knowledge, which is exactly
//! what a driver is for.
//!
//! Name: provisional, and this lane proposes a rename. Introduced 2026-07-27 when the UART
//! interrupt moved to userspace; nothing records the choice. The problem is not that the name
//! lacks a signature, it is that the tree grew three siblings that make it wrong: `block_driver`,
//! `gpu_driver` and `keyboard_driver` are all `<device>_driver`, and this is the fourth driver
//! and the only unqualified one. A reader who has correctly inferred the scheme cannot tell which
//! device this drives, which is the `dwarden` failure AGENTS.md cites as the evidence the naming
//! rule was needed. `keyboard_driver` is the precedent that settles the form: it was `kbd` until
//! 2026-08-27 and was spelled out. This program is the interrupt-driven console input driver for
//! the NS16550, so the case is for `serial_driver`, with `uart_driver` the alternative and the
//! acronym test the reason to prefer the first. `console_driver` is refused because `console` is
//! already a program. Proposed, not performed: a rename is calef's.
