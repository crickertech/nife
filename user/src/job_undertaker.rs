//! **The interactive boot's undertaker** (milestone 22 phase B.2, the interactive increment).
//!
//! The prompt's init builds a fresh process for every command a person runs. Before this program
//! existed, each of those processes stayed dead-but-uncollected forever and its region stayed spent,
//! so init's budget only ever went one way: a long session ran out of memory and the shell started
//! answering "could not spawn (init is out of memory)". Init could not collect them itself, because
//! there is no non-blocking receive and init is parked in `RECV` on the shell's spawn channel for its
//! whole life. So the collecting is a second process, and this is it.
//!
//! **Its authority is two endpoint capabilities and nothing else.** `READ` on init's supervision
//! endpoint, and `WRITE` on init's result endpoint so it can say one word to whoever is waiting
//! there. No untyped, no frame, no TCB, no address space. It cannot build a process, allocate a
//! page, or reach any child's memory; `Rendezvous::REAP` (DECISIONS §32) is authorized by the
//! supervision relationship the kernel already records, not by holding the region. The pages
//! therefore go back to **init's** job budget, because init split the region and §13 says a region
//! belongs to whoever owns it. This process can free a job's memory and can never spend it.
//!
//! **The second capability is milestone 235's whole fix**
//! (design/roadmap/235-a-faulted-job-should-reach-the-prompt.md). A job the kernel killed sends
//! nothing, so the shell's read of the result endpoint had nothing to complete it and the prompt
//! never came back. This process is the one that learns the job died, so it is the one that says
//! so: [`grant_plan::spawnproto::JOB_FAULTED`], once, after the corpse is collected. `WRITE` and no
//! `GRANT`: the right to say that word to the shell, and nothing it could hand on.
//!
//! It is deliberately not a supervisor in the `sub_server_supervisor` sense: it holds no restart
//! policy, because a command a person typed has no business being restarted when it ends. Collecting
//! is the whole job.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **It can say one word and no more.** A refused reap is still taken as the kernel contradicting
//! itself (it named a thread dead and then refused to collect it) and trapped on, which at least
//! dies loudly at the pc of the mistake. The visible symptom of this process dying is that init's
//! job budget stops coming back and the prompt eventually answers "could not spawn". Milestone 235
//! gave this program a channel for the one thing a person at a prompt has to be told; it did not
//! make it a reporter.
//!
//! **A fault report can park, and then it wedges this loop** (milestone 235, recorded rather than
//! solved). [`report`]'s `SEND` is a rendezvous and the ABI has no non-blocking send, so it
//! completes only when someone reads init's result endpoint. Every ordinary job leaves the shell
//! with a read outstanding there, so the common case rendezvous immediately. The exception is a
//! **screen-narrowed line** (DECISIONS §106, the shell watches its tail's own fault endpoint
//! instead): if a *non-tail* stage of such a line faults, nobody is reading the result endpoint,
//! this loop parks in the `SEND`, and it collects nothing further until the next command reads
//! there, which then takes the stale word and attributes the fault to the wrong line. The collect
//! happens **before** the report for exactly this reason, so a parked report never costs the
//! reclamation the prompt's memory depends on.
//!
//! Closing it needs either a non-blocking send or a receive that can wait on two endpoints, and
//! both are the syscall surface (DECISIONS §10, §16), which is calef's and not a lane's. Proposed
//! as its own milestone in this lane's report.
//!
//! **A refused reclaim is retried rather than trapped on** (milestone 31 phase 3, 2026-08-17), and
//! that is the one thing this program does that is not a single call. A job behind a directory grant
//! shares its region with the caretaker carrying the grant, so the first reclaim is refused by
//! construction and the retry is what collects it; see [`MAX_ATTEMPTS`], which explains the whole
//! mechanism and why running out is still a trap.
//!
//! It also cannot reap a **hung** job: a live thread is refused on purpose (§32), and nothing here
//! escalates. That is §32's recorded watchdog case and it belongs to milestone 23, not here. At the
//! prompt the forcible tier already exists for the case a person can see: `^C` twice tears the job's
//! region down through the shell (DECISIONS §24), and those jobs are built from the shell's own
//! untyped rather than init's, so they never reach this program at all.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-03 (calef), replacing `job_reaper`. Refused `job_reaper` (named for what
//! it does to jobs, while its siblings are named for what they serve, and "reaper" carries a faint
//! sense of taking a life) and, on 2026-08-04, `job_killer` (it claims an authority this program is
//! specifically denied). An undertaker arrives strictly after death and never causes it, which is
//! exactly the constraint DECISIONS §32 enforces by refusing to reap a live thread, and it joins
//! the register its siblings already speak: supervisor, caretaker, undertaker.
