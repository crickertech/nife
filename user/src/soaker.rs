//! The soaker: the workload that does not stop (milestone 219).
//!
//! `design/fatal-risks.md`'s fifth entry ("it cannot be made reliable on multicore, and the bugs
//! appear only on silicon") names its decisive experiment as sustained multi-core stress with the
//! load-sensitive assertions live. Nothing in this tree could sustain anything: the boot tour ran
//! its checks and the kernel halted. This is the thing that keeps running.
//!
//! # What it stresses, and why this and not something else
//!
//! **Cross-core IPC rendezvous, at the highest rate the machine will do them.** That is not a
//! guess about where the bugs are. It is where the one bug this risk has actually produced was: a
//! receiver made `Ready` with nothing delivered, on three harts of a VisionFive 2, in
//! `sched::wake_load_aware`. Every other candidate workload (a compute loop, an allocator churn, a
//! filesystem soak) exercises paths that a hundred other tests already cover; this one drives the
//! exact code the risk points at, through the real syscall boundary, from user mode.
//!
//! One round trip is `CALL` -> `RECV_CAP` -> `REPLY` -> the caller waking. That is **two** block/wake
//! handshakes, and each one may place its peer on a *different* core (`sched::pick_wake_target`,
//! `place_on`, the migration inbox, the reschedule IPI). With two runnable threads per core the run
//! queues also go empty often enough that `serve_steal_request` fires, so the work-steal protocol
//! is under load too rather than merely present.
//!
//! # The waiter, and what it is for (milestone 221)
//!
//! The workload above is saturated, and milestone 219 measured that a saturated workload **never
//! crosses cores**: the `crossings` count froze inside the first second and stayed frozen through
//! two million round trips. DECISIONS 138 (*how a saturated workload is made to hand threads across
//! cores*) explains why, and calef approved the fix on 2026-09-02: a soak build signals a
//! rendezvous from `sched::on_tick`, and one role per group blocks on it through `Irq::WAIT`.
//!
//! **A waiter is deliberately the least interesting program in this file.** All of the mechanism is
//! in the kernel's wake path, which is where the one defect this risk has produced lived; the
//! waiter's job is only to be a thread that is blocked when a real interrupt handler decides where
//! to put it.
//!
//! **What crosses is the waiters, not the pairs.** Rendezvous wakes stay local whatever else is
//! happening, so the callers and responders are as pinned as they ever were. This sustains the wake
//! protocol across cores under load; it does not make the IPC workload migrate.
//!
//! # Why the pairs do not run in lockstep
//!
//! A soak that repeats one interleaving a billion times has explored one interleaving. Each worker
//! spins a small, pseudo-random number of iterations between round trips (an xorshift seeded from
//! `arg2`, which the kernel makes distinct per worker), so the phase relationship between pairs
//! drifts continuously instead of locking. That is the difference between a long run and a wide
//! one, and it costs four instructions.
//!
//! # The soaker's world
//!
//! - **slot 0**: the request endpoint. `WRITE` for a caller (it `CALL`s), `READ` for a responder
//!   (it `RECV_CAP`s). Nothing else. A soaker cannot name the console, the clock, or its peer. A
//!   **waiter** (milestone 221) holds an `Irq` in the same slot instead, naming the tick route and
//!   nothing else, so it can `WAIT` and cannot touch its group's IPC at all.
//! - **the shared page**, mapped read/write at [`soak_page::VA`], where it publishes its own two
//!   counters and reads nothing. The kernel is the reader.
//!
//! It never exits. That is the whole point, and it is why the kernel spawns it rather than init:
//! the operator ends the run by taking the power away or by the watcher's deadline expiring.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A green soak proves nothing about the concurrency being correct.** It reports a number, and
//!   the number's only use is comparison against another run. `design/roadmap/219-a-workload-that-does-not-stop.md`
//!   says this at more length and says it as the milestone's own headline caveat.
//! - **The counters are not synchronised with the kernel's read.** The kernel samples the page
//!   while workers are writing it, so a heartbeat's `rounds` total may be a few short. It is a
//!   progress measure, not an audit; a systematic error of a handful of round trips against tens of
//!   millions changes no verdict this workload can reach.
//! - **A waiter's wakes are not round trips and are counted apart from them.** Its `rounds` stays
//!   at zero forever and its `wakes` is its own field in the heartbeat, because folding the two
//!   together would make the number a later run is compared against mean something different
//!   depending on which build produced it.
//! - **A waiter whose `WAIT` is refused spins instead of reporting.** It cannot print and has no
//!   channel to say anything on, so it stops counting and lets the kernel's stall check speak for
//!   it one beat later. The report then says "stalled" where "refused" would be more use, which is
//!   the same limitation the role above it already has.
//! - **A responder cannot detect a caller that stops calling.** It simply blocks in `RECV_CAP`
//!   forever, and its own counter stops moving, which is what the kernel's stall check sees. The
//!   report cannot say which half of the pair wedged; the thread dump can.
//!
//! Name: provisional, this lane's coinage (2026-09-01, milestone 219), and calef's call. An agent
//! noun in the family this directory already has (`spinner`, `heeder`, `builder`, `swapper`,
//! `painter`): the thing that soaks. `stressor` was considered and refused, because "stress" in
//! this tree already names `script/repeat-under-load`'s *induced host load*, which is a different
//! thing pointed the other way. `churner` was refused for naming the motion rather than the
//! purpose.
