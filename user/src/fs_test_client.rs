//! **The FS-service client** (milestone 32 phase 2): opens a file through a granted directory
//! capability and proves the whole stack end to end.
//!
//! This is the program a milestone-31 shell will one day be. It holds an endpoint to the FS server
//! and nothing that names the server, the block server, or the disk. That endpoint IS its directory
//! capability: it can open names the server resolves under the bound directory, and it can open
//! nothing else, because there is no global namespace to reach into. It reads the `motd` the image
//! ships with, then writes a pattern to `scratch` and reads it back, and reports the `motd` head
//! plus a success sentinel. Any failed check panics, which faults, which fails the waiting test.
//!
//! # Capability contract (notes/fs-server.md, notes/abi.md §4)
//! - **slot 0**: the file-service endpoint, `WRITE` (this is the directory capability; the client
//!   `CALL`s here).
//! - **slot 1**: the report endpoint, `WRITE`.
//! - **[`FILE_VA`]**: the base of the channel shared with the FS server (a name out, file bytes
//!   both ways). `filesystem_proto::fs::TRANSFER_PAGES` pages, all of them mapped by this client's wiring,
//!   because the throughput role asks for the whole of it in one request.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `fsclient`. Refused `fsclient`
//! (squished) and `fs_client` (any program that wants files is an FS client, so that name belongs
//! to the real thing; it also predicts "a client of the FS service" rather than "the program the
//! kernel spawns to prove the FS contract holds").

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks

/// **The filesystem throughput benchmark** (milestone 38, DECISIONS §34 condition 2). Six phases
/// over one file, each self-timed and reported home as `[ticks, transfers, phase]`: sequential
/// write, sequential read, random read, a record-aligned read, random write, and the client's own
/// payload cost. The bench boot turns those into the `fs_seq_write` / `fs_seq_read` /
/// `fs_rand_read` / `fs_record_read` / `fs_rand_write` / `fs_payload_fill` lines and into MiB/s.
///
/// **What one transfer is, and why that is the whole story.** One `filesystem_proto` request moves at most
/// `fs::TRANSFER_MAX` bytes, because the payload travels through the region the client shares with
/// the server. That was one page until milestone 138 step 3 and is sixteen now, so a phase here is
/// `UNIT` per request and the throughput is the request rate times `UNIT`. A Linux program reading
/// the same file would use a 64 KiB or 1 MiB buffer and pay one syscall for it; **that difference
/// is a property of this protocol, not of the measurement**, and it is still the first thing
/// notes/benchmarks.md says next to the numbers. It got smaller; it did not go away.
///
/// **The bytes moved per phase are held constant** (`tp::TOTAL`, 1 MiB) rather than the transfer
/// count, so a run at one page and a run at sixteen move the same file and their MiB/s figures are
/// a before and an after rather than two unrelated numbers.
///
/// **Why the write phase comes first.** It creates the file, so it is the only phase that pays
/// allocation, and the read phases have something laid out by the server under test rather than by
/// the host tool. It is also the reason there is no separate "create" number.
///
/// **What a write here promises, which decides what it compares against.** Every `filesystem_proto` write
/// goes through one RedoxFS transaction that commits to the header ring before the reply, so the
/// filesystem's own state is durable per request the way `O_DSYNC` makes ext4's; but no device
/// flush is issued unless a client asks for one (`filesystem_proto::fs::SYNC`), so the bytes sit where
/// `O_DIRECT` alone leaves them. This sits **between** Linux's two, and notes/benchmarks.md prints
/// both rather than picking one.
///
/// **The offsets are drawn from a fixed seed**, so "random" means the same sequence on every run
/// and two runs are comparable. They are page-aligned and inside the file, so a random read never
/// hits EOF and a random write never extends the file: the random phases measure placement, not
/// growth.
///
/// A read phase's timed loop issues nothing but the `CALL`: the bytes are never copied out, because
/// a client that shares a page with its server can use them where they land, which is one copy
/// fewer than a Unix `read(2)`. A write phase's loop repaints the page first, and has to; see the
