nife links a C component into the `c_shim` program (milestone 36, DECISIONS \u{a7}30), so the
build needs a bare-metal clang with ALL THREE of the AArch64, RISC-V and X86 backends. Apple's
clang, in the Xcode command line tools, has no RISC-V backend and is deliberately rejected: two
different compilers for two of the architectures would break the parity gate (DECISIONS \u{a7}19).

  macOS:   brew install llvm      (script/bootstrap does this)
  Debian:  sudo apt-get install clang
  other:   any clang whose `clang -print-targets` lists aarch64, riscv64 and x86-64

Then re-run the build. To point at a specific compiler, set NIFE_CC=/path/to/clang.";
