//! **The install gate**: a stick boots, puts itself on a disk, and the machine boots from that disk
//! with the stick gone (milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install that makes a
//! second customer possible), rung 2a.
//!
//! Milestone 515 (a stick that puts itself on the machine's disk) is the proposal it follows.
//!
//! # Why it is two boots
//!
//! **A sequence that only works while the stick is still attached has not installed anything.** The
//! second boot is therefore the whole gate: the first one is a setup step for it, and everything the
//! first one asserts is only there so a failure says which half broke.
//!
//! Three properties are deliberately arranged so that the second boot cannot succeed by accident:
//!
//! - **The stick is not attached at all**, not merely deprioritised. `NIFE_UEFI_NO_STICK=1` removes
//!   the vvfat drive from the machine.
//! - **The firmware variable store is deleted before each boot.** The default store persists across
//!   runs in a checkout, so boot 1 would leave a boot option that boot 2 then rode. Deleting it is
//!   what makes "the firmware found it on its own" a claim about the disk rather than about our
//!   leftovers, and it is the measurement milestone 515 calls B1 and calls unmeasured.
//! - **The NVMe image is created empty**, every run, so nothing survives from the last one.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```console
//! $ cargo xtask install-boot
//! --- boot 1 of 2: the stick installs itself onto an empty NVMe disk ---
//!   install     : installed. nife data at LBA 2048, EFI system at LBA 1046528.
//! --- boot 2 of 2: the same machine with the stick detached ---
//! BdsDxe: loading Boot0001 "UEFI QEMU NVMe Ctrl nife-nvme 1" ...
//! $ ls
//!   made-on-target
//! install-boot: PASS
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **It is one disk of one size**, a 1 GiB image. The installer's layout arithmetic has a floor
//!   and a rounding step that nothing here varies, and a disk under about 600 MiB is refused by
//!   code no test exercises.
//! - **It proves nothing about a real firmware.** OVMF is one implementation and a generous one.
//!   Rung 2b is the bench half and belongs to somebody with xenon in front of them.
//! - **The two boots take several minutes under TCG**, most of it the ten-megabyte copy at one
//!   4096-byte request per round trip. It is not in `script/test`'s default legs for that reason.
//! - **A failure leaves the NVMe image behind**, on purpose: it is the evidence, and
//!   `hdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage` on the partition reads the EFI system
//!   partition it wrote.
