// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Open a real board's serial console, log every byte, and stop on a deadline.
///
/// The engine is `crates/board_console`; this is argument parsing and a report, deliberately, for
/// the reason every host-logic crate in this tree exists: the interesting half is a recogniser
/// over text, and a recogniser wants a thousand host tests in milliseconds, not a board.
///
/// It returns an [`ExitCode`] of its own rather than the `bool` the rest of `main` uses, because
/// this command has four answers and not two: reached, announced a failure, went quiet, ran out.
/// A caller scripting a bench run wants to tell those apart, and squeezing them into
/// success/failure is exactly the loss of information the milestone is about.
/// **Read a finished capture of many boots and print what the lottery drew** (milestone 249).
///
/// `board_console::lottery` is the whole of the logic and has the tests; this reads a file and
/// prints. Two exit statuses only, and they are not the watcher's four: this is an analysis of a
/// log that has already happened, so there is no board to have gone quiet.
///
/// `0` even when a series is short or a draw is unjudged, because those are results and the report
/// says so in words. `4` only when the file cannot be read, which is the same code the watcher
/// gives an argument it cannot use.

// label, U-Boot's pxe path hands `bootm` no device tree at all, and RISC-V's `boot_prep_linux`
// refuses rather than guessing: `Device tree not found or missing FDT support`, then
// `### ERROR ### Please RESET the board ###`, which is a `hang()` that only the reset button
// clears. Captured on the board 2026-09-01;
// crates/board_console/tests/fixtures/captured/vf2-2026-09-01-extlinux-refused.log is the transcript,
// and it is evidence about U-Boot rather than about this kernel: the payload never ran.
//
// So the card carries a U-Boot script instead. `scan_dev_for_scripts` sources it, and it issues
// exactly the commands a person types at the `StarFive #` prompt today, which is the sequence the
// same day's successful boot proves (vf2-2026-09-01-manual-boot.log). Nothing about the boot
// changes; only who types it. See notes/visionfive2.md.

/// the load device comes from the variables distro boot has already set for the script it is
/// running (`boot_a_script` sets `devtype`, `devnum` and `distro_bootpart` before sourcing this),
/// and the archive's length is stashed under a name of ours the moment `load` reports it, so that
/// a later command which happens to set `filesize` cannot change what `booti` is told.
///
/// Two addresses stay literal because they are choices rather than discoveries, and
/// notes/visionfive2.md carries the arithmetic for both: `0x8600_0000` for the device tree, inside

///
/// **Why the card is still in here at all.** A card written once and left in the board is only an
/// improvement if it survives the network going away. A cable out of the hub, a router rebooting,
/// a lease that does not arrive: each of those turns a card that only knows about TFTP into a board
/// that boots nothing, and the fix is a walk to the bench with a card reader, which is the exact
/// cost this milestone exists to remove. So the network is an optimisation over the card rather

/// **The shape, and why it is this shape.** U-Boot's parser is a cut-down hush and nothing here has
/// been watched running on the board, so the structure is deliberately the dullest one that can
/// express a fallback: one state variable, `if cmd; then` and `fi`, nesting never deeper than two,
/// and no `else` anywhere. A chain of guards costs a few more lines than nested branches and has
/// fewer parser features between us and a board that boots.
///
/// **Nothing is loaded twice from two places.** The kernel and the archive are one measured pair
/// (`script/board-image` says so at length), so a network transfer that gets the kernel and loses
/// the archive falls all the way back and takes BOTH from the card. Half a pair boots to
/// `MEASURED BOOT REFUSED`, which is the gate working, and it would be working on a fault we built.
///
/// **`autoload no`** because bare `dhcp` in U-Boot means "get an address **and** TFTP the bootfile
/// from the server DHCP names", not "get an address". Without it the board fetches from whatever the
/// DHCP server advertises, which on a home network is the router; radon did exactly that on
/// 2026-09-05, reported `TFTP from server 192.168.8.1` and then `TFTP server died`, and because
/// `dhcp` returns failure when its autoload fails, the whole network branch was skipped and the card
/// fallback fired. The boot looked like a clean fallback and was a bug. The line was in the manual
/// sequence that proved this path on 2026-09-04 and was left out of the transcript the script was
/// written from, which is why no test could have caught it: every test stubbed `dhcp`.
///
/// **`netretry no`** so that a network that is not there fails in seconds instead of retrying while
/// nobody is watching. That is the whole difference between a fallback and a hang.
