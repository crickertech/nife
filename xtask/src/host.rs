/// 266 retired the one exception, which packed `hello` under the entry `init` on aarch64).
///
/// **The path is ABSOLUTE, and that is not fussiness.** Cargo runs the runner script with the
/// working directory set to the **package** dir for `cargo test` and the workspace root for
/// `cargo run`. A relative path therefore resolved under `cargo run` and silently did not under
/// `cargo test`, so the tests booted with no initrd at all and the one that noticed was the one
/// that panicked.
///
/// That lesson was written on a `user_elf()` helper that computed this same path for `hello`
/// alone, and was `bin_elf("hello")` in every respect but the comment. Milestone 130 folded it in
/// when `initrd_aarch64` stopped needing a special case for `init`; the warning belongs here, where
/// every caller reads it, rather than on the one caller that happened to earn it.
