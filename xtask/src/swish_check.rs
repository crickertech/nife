/// **Boot the `--features shell` system and type at it** (milestone 50, notes/pipes.md).
///
/// # Why this exists
///
/// Everything else that exercises the shell wires it from **the kernel**, which serves the spawn
/// protocol in place of `components/src/progenitor.rs`. The shell cannot tell the difference, and
/// that is the problem: a change to the progenitor that broke the spawn path fails nothing. The interactive
/// boot is the only thing that runs the real progenitor, and until this verb existed nothing ran the
/// interactive boot.
///
/// It bit milestone 50 three times in one session and **all three presented as a boot that printed
/// nothing at all**: a virtual-address collision between the shell's terminal page and the page six
/// FS clients map, the progenitor's sixteen-slot capability table overflowing when the kernel handed it two more grants,
/// and four stack pages being one deep call short of the redirection path. Each cost a manual bisect
/// against a live prompt. Each is caught here in one boot.
///
/// # What it types, and why those lines
///
/// The lines answer each other rather than a constant, which is the shape the milestone's guest
/// tests already have:
///
/// ```text
/// echo hello world | wc      -> 1 2 12   the bytes went through a real spawned process
/// echo hello world > gate    -> nothing  the same bytes into a file the shell backs
/// wc < gate                  -> 1 2 12   ... and they are the same bytes
/// echo hello world >> gate   -> nothing
/// wc < gate                  -> 2 4 24   ... exactly twice, so `>>` kept the first line
/// wc gate                    -> 2 4 24   milestone 31: the name IS the grant, same bytes
/// wc                         -> refused  ... and with no name there is nothing to read
/// caps wc gate               -> input     ... and the preview says which file, and how
/// date                       -> ...UTC   a real wall clock, wired through the real progenitor
/// caps date                  -> cap 1    ... and `caps` names the capability that made it real
/// ```
///
/// One line would meet the BUGS entry that asked for this. Five is still seconds, and it walks the
/// whole endowment: a spawn through the real progenitor, the FS service the real progenitor narrowed into the
/// shell, and both redirection operators.

/// nothing shuffled can be mistaken for it.

/// 3. Neither, and the kernel was writing during the boot -> [`BootClaim::Unreadable`]. A pass, and
///    the caller says so out loud.
/// 4. Neither, and nothing else was writing -> [`BootClaim::Silent`]. A failure: with one writer

///
/// **Under OVMF, from the same `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` `cargo xtask uefi-image` stages for a
/// USB stick**, not through QEMU's PVH `-kernel` loader. That image is the thing a customer boots
/// (DECISIONS §157, milestone 198's rung 1), so it is the one worth typing at: the loader, the
/// firmware's memory map and ACPI tables, and the console server's tee onto the firmware's screen
/// (milestone 400) are all on the path, and the PVH boot has none of them. What it costs over PVH
/// is recorded in milestone 182's block, measured rather than asserted.
///
/// Three `x86_64` differences, each forced by the machine rather than chosen:
///
/// - **The default kernel, not `--features shell`.** `x86_64` has no early hand-over: every boot
///   runs the tour and then hands over (milestone 268), and `uefi_image` builds exactly that.
/// - **The kernel's hand-over report lands after the prompt.** `x86_hand_over` watches the
///   progenitor for ten seconds and then prints two lines, so the transcript does not end in `$ `
///   until something is typed. The leg waits for that report and then presses Enter once, so the
///   report cannot splice into a typed line's echo and the first line meets a fresh prompt.
/// - **No virtio-rng, so `RDSEED`.** Every entropy device the kernel can find is virtio-mmio and
///   `q35` has no mmio bus, so the kernel builds the progenitor's entropy service on the CPU's seed
///   instruction instead (milestone 595 (provisional)), which the runner's `-cpu max` implements.
///   The leg asserts the progenitor said so, because a boot that silently fell back to no entropy
///   would otherwise surface only as the `uuid` lines failing.

    //   1. This check fires, naming the thread and the reason, so it is a check that can fail
    //      rather than one that only ever passes. That mattered: it was written against a tree
    //      where `login` had just stopped dying, so nothing else would have exercised it.
    //   2. **The prompt never comes back.** The run also failed with "the prompt never came back
    //      to take `least_authority_demo 6`", because the shell waits on the result endpoint of a job that
    //      faulted instead of sending, and nothing wakes that wait. A spawned command that traps
    //      hangs the shell rather than returning a status. That is a real limitation this gate now

/// target machines actually has: argon, radon and xenon all have a serial line and none has a
/// virtio-input device.
///
/// **The same two assertions cover both**, and that they can is the claim. What reaches the screen
/// is `line_editor`'s echo of one `OP_BYTES` `CALL` on one endpoint, and neither this leg nor
/// anything past `kbd_ep` in the guest can tell which program made that `CALL`. If a future change
/// made the graphical stack depend on the keystroke's source, exactly one of these two runs would
/// go red.
///
/// # Why this cannot be [`swish_check_leg`] with two env vars added
///
/// [`swish_check_leg`]'s whole verification is a transcript piped over the UART: `console`/`input`
/// are exactly the two programs the graphical boot does not spawn (design/roadmap/
/// 177-graphical-interactive-boot.md's own finding), so there is no serial channel left to pipe.
/// The only observable surface is what a person looking at the screen would see, which on this

/// (`sendkey`) for the same reason `kernel/src/user/display_tests.rs`'s own keyboard test needs the
/// host to press one: nothing in the guest can.
///
/// # Why this proves less than [`swish_check_leg`], and on purpose
///
/// [`SWISH_CHECK_SCRIPT`] is many lines because it is the whole redirection/pipeline/glob/manual
/// story, and every one of those checks a known **string**. There is no equivalent "the known
/// picture" to check against here: the boot banner's exact wrapped, scrolled position in an 18x8
/// grid is a function of wording nobody wants two copies of (one in `crates/system_initializer`,
/// one in this gate), and predicting it exactly is real work for no claim this milestone needs to
/// make. What this leg proves is the thing milestone 177 actually adds: the graphical stack wires
/// up with no capability-slot collision (a collision fails the boot in total silence, so *any*
/// prompt reaching the screen disproves one) and a real keystroke, through `keyboard_driver`'s new direct
/// `CALL` to `line_editor` and back out through `display_terminal`, reaches the screen. Proving the
/// rest of [`SWISH_CHECK_SCRIPT`] against a graphical prompt is real, scoped-out follow-on work,
/// not a gap this leg pretends is closed.
///
/// It looks for `$ ` (the exact two bytes `swish` prints for every prompt, `proto`-unrelated to
/// anything this leg computed in advance) anywhere in the decoded grid, not at a predicted row: a
/// terminal this small scrolls before the banner finishes, and which row the prompt lands on is
/// exactly the thing not worth predicting twice. Finding it at all is the proof that the progenitor built the
/// console... no: that it built `line_editor`, `display_terminal` and the display driver, wired
/// them to each other with no wrong slot, and that `swish` is alive and printing through them.
/// Finding `$ a` after `sendkey "a"` is the proof that a keystroke makes the same round trip back:
/// `keyboard_driver` (`MODE_DIRECT`) into `line_editor`, echoed out through `display_terminal`.
/// Which keystroke source [`swish_check_leg_graphical`] wires up. See its doc; the fork is
