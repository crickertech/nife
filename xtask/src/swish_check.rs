/// **Boot the `--features shell` system and type at it** (milestone 50, notes/pipes.md).
///
/// # Why this exists
///
/// Everything else that exercises the shell wires it from **the kernel**, which serves the spawn
/// protocol in place of `components/src/progenitor.rs`. The shell cannot tell the difference, and
/// that is the problem: a change to the progenitor that broke the spawn path fails nothing. The interactive
/// boot is the only thing that runs the real progenitor, and until this verb existed nothing ran the
/// interactive boot.
///
/// It bit milestone 50 three times in one session and **all three presented as a boot that printed
/// nothing at all**: a virtual-address collision between the shell's terminal page and the page six
/// FS clients map, the progenitor's sixteen-slot capability table overflowing when the kernel handed it two more grants,
/// and four stack pages being one deep call short of the redirection path. Each cost a manual bisect
/// against a live prompt. Each is caught here in one boot.
///
/// # What it types, and why those lines
///
/// The lines answer each other rather than a constant, which is the shape the milestone's guest
/// tests already have:
///
/// ```text
/// echo hello world | wc      -> 1 2 12   the bytes went through a real spawned process
/// echo hello world > gate    -> nothing  the same bytes into a file the shell backs
/// wc < gate                  -> 1 2 12   ... and they are the same bytes
/// echo hello world >> gate   -> nothing
/// wc < gate                  -> 2 4 24   ... exactly twice, so `>>` kept the first line
/// wc gate                    -> 2 4 24   milestone 31: the name IS the grant, same bytes
/// wc                         -> refused  ... and with no name there is nothing to read
/// caps wc gate               -> input     ... and the preview says which file, and how
/// date                       -> ...UTC   a real wall clock, wired through the real progenitor
/// caps date                  -> cap 1    ... and `caps` names the capability that made it real
/// ```
///
/// One line would meet the BUGS entry that asked for this. Five is still seconds, and it walks the
/// whole endowment: a spawn through the real progenitor, the FS service the real progenitor narrowed into the
/// shell, and both redirection operators.

/// 230 saw the same code pass one CI run and fail the next, and saw `construction budget dropped`
/// reduced to a longest surviving run of `const`. **No matcher can be made reliable against that**,
/// because any string a matcher keys on can itself be split, including the kernel's own signature
/// (`the kernel is fine.` came out as `the kernel iis fnit: constiner.`).
///
/// So the safety does not live in the matching. It lives in **which question is asked first**, and
/// in one asymmetry that a shuffle cannot break:
///
/// > Interleaving can **destroy** a string. It cannot **create** one.
///
/// Therefore an exact search for the sentence the progenitor prints when the answer is *no* has no false
/// positives: if `construction budget NOT dropped` is in the transcript, the progenitor printed it. That is
/// the check with the teeth, it runs first, and it is exact rather than tolerant precisely so that
/// nothing shuffled can be mistaken for it.
///
/// Everything after it only decides between passing and saying why:
///
/// 1. `negative` present, **exactly** -> [`BootClaim::Denied`]. The progenitor reported the failing answer.
/// 2. `positive` present, exactly or shuffled -> [`BootClaim::Affirmed`].
/// 3. Neither, and the kernel was writing during the boot -> [`BootClaim::Unreadable`]. A pass, and
///    the caller says so out loud.
/// 4. Neither, and nothing else was writing -> [`BootClaim::Silent`]. A failure: with one writer
///    there is nothing to shuffle, so the progenitor really did not say it.
///
/// # What this trades, said plainly
///
/// It moves the residual error from **false red to false green**, on purpose, and that is the right
/// direction for a check that runs in CI on every lane. A false red taxes work that is not the cause
/// and this tree has deleted three checks for that signature. A false green here is recoverable by
/// repetition, because the failure it guards is persistent rather than transient: a progenitor that stops
/// dropping its budget prints the negative sentence on *every* boot, on both legs, on every push, so
/// hiding it requires the shuffle to land on that sentence every time.
///
/// The residual hole is case 4's converse and is named in `script/swish-check`'s own BUGS: if the progenitor's

    //      rather than one that only ever passes. That mattered: it was written against a tree
    //      where `login` had just stopped dying, so nothing else would have exercised it.
    //   2. **The prompt never comes back.** The run also failed with "the prompt never came back
    //      to take `least_authority_demo 6`", because the shell waits on the result endpoint of a job that
    //      faulted instead of sending, and nothing wakes that wait. A spawned command that traps
    //      hangs the shell rather than returning a status. That is a real limitation this gate now

/// **The graphical launch, folded into the plain legs' boots** (2026-10-03 UTC, calef's ruling; it was
/// `swish_check_leg_graphical` and the `--graphical` and `--graphical-serial` flags, and a CI job
/// of its own, until then). Milestone 632 (provisional), reversing milestone 177 (wire the graphical terminal stack into the real interactive boot)'s boot-half: the
/// `--features shell` boot is now the **normal UART system on every boot** (the minimal shape
/// of DECISIONS §26 (the fault endpoint: thread death becomes a message a supervisor holds)), and graphics is *launched*: this leg types `graphical_terminal` at the swish prompt and
/// verifies what the launched session puts on the screen, read back with a `screendump` rather
/// than a serial transcript.
///
/// # What the check does, in order
///
/// 1. [`swish_check_boot`] boots the normal system with a virtio-gpu attached (see
///    [`swish_check_leg`] for which of a leg's boots), reading the UART transcript: the swish
///    prompt must appear on the serial console before anything is typed, which is the assertion
///    that the boot stayed minimal. A boot that quietly rebuilt the graphical stack at boot time,
///    the shape calef's 2026-09-30 ruling reverses, would print no UART prompt and the boot fails
///    right there.
/// 2. [`launch_graphical_terminal`] types `graphical_terminal` over the UART. The shell asks
///    (`spawnproto::GRAPHICS_BIT`; it holds no device since milestone 715 (provisional)), the
///    progenitor builds the session's stack from the devices it holds, and the session prints its
///    own `$ ` prompt on the screen.
/// 3. It presses one key and requires its echo on the screen: `sendkey` on the device arm, the same
///    byte down the UART on the serial arm, which is a real round trip through the boot's line
///    discipline in raw mode and the session's own echo.
///
/// # Two keystroke sources, one check (milestone 192 (a keyboard on real silicon), option A)
///
/// [`Keystrokes::Device`] attaches a virtio-keyboard and presses a key with the QEMU monitor's
/// `sendkey`; the session's `keyboard_driver` feeds its line discipline. [`Keystrokes::Serial`]
/// attaches **no** keyboard and types the same byte down the guest's UART, which is the
/// configuration every one of the three target machines actually has: argon, radon and xenon all
/// have a serial line and none has a virtio-input device. That arm is milestone 192's option A
/// (serial input, screen output) at launch rather than at boot: the session reads the boot's own
/// line discipline raw (`OP_RAWMODE`/`OP_READRAW`, the shell's own §227 shape) and paints the
/// echo itself.
///
/// **The same two assertions cover both**, and that they can is still the claim. What reaches the
/// screen is the session's echo of one keystroke, and neither the screen nor the session can tell
/// which source the byte arrived by. If a future change made the session depend on the
/// keystroke's source, exactly one of these two runs would go red.
///
/// # The silent-failure property, and why any prompt at all is the proof
///
/// This leg's central assertion is unchanged in kind from milestone 177's: **a capability-slot
/// collision anywhere in the session's build fails in total silence** (the shell's seven held
/// grants, the progenitor receiving them, the four to five children built from one region, and
/// the session program's own table are all slot-accounted, and the failure mode of every one of
/// them is a process that never says anything), so *any* `$ ` prompt reaching the screen
/// disproves one. The retarget adds two more silent surfaces to the count rather than removing
/// any: the boot's own table now carries the device grants to the shell's build, and the shell's
/// table carries them for the boot's life. Finding the session's prompt at all is the proof; the
/// `swish-check` plain legs already prove the boot side.
///
/// # Why this proves less than [`swish_check_leg`], and on purpose
///
/// There is no "the known picture" to check against here, for 177's own reasons: predicting the
/// boot banner's wrapped position in a small grid is real work for no claim this milestone needs
/// to make. What this leg proves is the launch: the normal boot came up on the UART, the devices
/// moved from the shell's slots into drivers without a collision, and one real keystroke crossed
/// from its source to the screen. The old graphical *boot* legs are retired by this retarget:
/// the boot they booted no longer exists, and their claim (the stack wires up) is subsumed here.
///
/// It looks for `$ ` anywhere in the decoded grid, not at a predicted row, for 177's own reason:
/// which row the prompt lands on is exactly the thing not worth predicting twice. Finding `$ a`
/// after the key press is the proof that the keystroke made the round trip back to the screen,
/// through the session's discipline and `display_terminal` (device arm) or through the boot
/// discipline's raw queue and the session's own echo (serial arm). Which keystroke source this
/// leg wires up is `Keystrokes`; the guest's own copy of that choice is the `graphical_terminal` program's
/// `x0`, decided by whether the keyboard's three caps arrived.
