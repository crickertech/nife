/// **The instruction-count instrument** (milestone 78;
/// design/roadmap/78-load-sensitive-assertions.md), on both ISAs because parity is a gate (§19).
///
/// Boots a `--features icount` kernel under `-icount shift=0,sleep=off`, where QEMU's virtual clock
/// advances by exactly one nanosecond per guest instruction retired and by nothing else. The guest
/// asserts two claims a wall-clock test cannot make (that the timer fired at the deadline the kernel
/// armed, and that the handler costs fewer than N instructions) and prints what it measured.
///
/// **This is not on the test path and that is the design.** `-icount` changes what QEMU is, and the
/// two ways that matter are not the one the milestone block gave: it is **not** measurably slower on
/// compute (measured, 2026-08-17), but it gives every vCPU **one shared virtual clock**, which forces
/// `-smp 1` and would silently retire every cross-core property the suite proves, and it makes a
/// clock-bound wait cost instructions rather than host time. So the instrument gets its own boot,
/// exactly as `script/bench` does, and the test path is untouched. See notes/instruction-clock.md.
///
/// The verdict arrives the bench boot's way rather than through semihosting: the guest prints
/// `icount: done` and parks in `wfi`, this owns the child and kills it. A panic (a violated claim)
/// prints `[PANIC]` and is a failure; so is reaching end of output with neither.
