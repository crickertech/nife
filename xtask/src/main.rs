//! See DECISIONS §7.
//!
//!     cargo xtask run      boot the kernel (the milestone tour), print to this terminal
//!     cargo xtask shell    boot straight to the interactive shell (add --hvf for the real core)
//!     cargo xtask swish-check  boot that same shell, type at it, and check what it answered
//!     cargo xtask test     host tests (milliseconds), then the kernel under QEMU
//!                          (--hvf runs the aarch64 kernel leg on the physical core)
//!     cargo xtask gdb      boot paused, waiting for a debugger on :1234
//!     cargo xtask objdump  disassemble the kernel
//!     cargo xtask image    build the flat arm64 Image and dump its header
//!     cargo xtask board-console  read the serial console of a real board, log it, stop on a deadline
//!                                (and, under --stop, send the one byte that ends a rebooting soak)
//!     cargo xtask board-script   write the U-Boot script that boots the board without a person at its prompt
//!
//! Note that `run` and `test` do NOT invoke QEMU themselves. They just call cargo,
//! which invokes `helpers/qemu-runner-aarch64.sh` via the runner setting in
//! `.cargo/config.toml`. That script is the single source of truth for how the kernel
//! gets booted, so there is exactly one place to get the QEMU flags wrong.
