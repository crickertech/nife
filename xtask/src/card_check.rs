//! **milestone 223 (read a card and say whether its kernel and archive match), before the power cycle.**
//!
//! `cargo xtask card-check [path]`, and `script/card-check` is the front door. With no path it reads
//! `target/board`, the payload this tree last built; with one it reads a mounted card, a staged
//! stick directory, or a single UEFI boot file.
//!
//! The comparison is `sealed_pair`'s and is documented there: the SHA-256 of each archive entry the
//! kernel may enter, looked for in the kernel image's compiled-in trust root. This file is the part
//! that finds the two files and says what to do about the answer, which is the whole point of the
//! milestone. The refusal already existed; what did not exist was somewhere for it to arrive before
//! a person walked to the board.
//!
//! **Which half is stale** is a question `sealed_pair` cannot answer on its own, because a digest
//! the kernel does not carry is not a digest anything can find in it. This file answers it the only
//! way a host can: by comparing both files against what the tree last built, in `target/board`. When
//! that build is absent or itself stale the answer is "one of these two", and it says so rather than
//! guessing.
