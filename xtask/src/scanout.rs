//! The scanout check (milestone 29): prove the pixels reached the DEVICE, not only our buffer.
//!
//! The in-guest test proves the framebuffer byte for byte, and cannot do better: the suite runs
//! `-display none` and nothing inside the guest can read QEMU's host-side surface back, so a wrong
//! pixel format or scanout rectangle would pass it and show garbage on a real screen.
//!
//! QEMU's monitor closes that gap, and it works headlessly: `screendump FILE` writes a PPM of the
//! scanout even with no display backend. So the runners take a monitor socket (`NIFE_GPU_MON`), and
//! this drives it **while the ordinary test run is happening**, rather than paying for a second boot:
//! the suite is minutes long per ISA and the pattern stays on the scanout from the display test until
//! QEMU exits, so there is no need to synchronize with the guest at all. Poll, dump, compare; the
//! first match ends the polling.
//!
//! Fail-safe by construction. If the pattern never reaches the scanout, or the display test stops
//! running, or the confinement test's device reset moves after it and wipes the surface, no dump
//! matches and this reports it. Nothing here can make a broken scanout look fine.
