//! **The rollback gate**: a deliberately doomed upgrade is installed, tried, and abandoned, and the
//! machine comes back on the image it had before, with nobody typing anything (rung 2b of
//! milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install that makes a second customer possible)).
//!
//! **This file is the deliverable, not the code it exercises.** A rollback mechanism nobody has
//! seen roll back is a claim. Everything in `crates/boot_slot`, `components/src/installer.rs` and
//! `uefi_loader/src/chooser.rs` is only as good as the three boots below.
//!
//! # What the three boots are, and why the middle one is killed
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | 1 | the stick installs itself, exactly as `cargo xtask install-boot`'s first boot does |
//! | | *the host writes an upgrade into slot 1 and marks it on trial, above slot 0* |
//! | 2 | the machine picks slot 1, spends its one try, hands off, **and is killed at that instant** |
//! | 3 | the machine picks slot 0 and comes up, and slot 1 is never tried again |
//!
//! **Killing the machine at the handoff is the test, not a shortcut.** The failure this feature
//! exists for is an image that starts and never comes up: a kernel that wedges, a driver that spins,
//! a power cut. From the disk's point of view those are all the same event, which is *the try was
//! spent and nothing came back*, and QEMU dying one instruction after `StartImage` produces exactly
//! that event. It is the one failure class the chooser cannot observe for itself, which is why the
//! try is written before the handoff and why this is the boot worth staging.
//!
//! The upgrade in slot 1 is a **byte-for-byte copy of the working image**, deliberately. A slot
//! holding garbage would be caught by the header's checksum inside one boot, and that would test
//! the cheap half. What is being tested here is that a perfectly loadable image which then fails to
//! come up is given up on, and the only thing that can decide that is the try spent on the disk.
//!
//! # What it asserts, and what a failure of each one would mean
//!
//! - Boot 2 says `starting boot slot 1`. **Priority chose the upgrade over the running image**;
//!   without this the rest proves nothing, because the machine would have been on slot 0 anyway.
//! - Boot 3 says `starting boot slot 0` and never mentions slot 1. **The decrement reached the
//!   disk and survived a power cycle**, which is the property the whole design rests on.
//! - Boot 3 reaches a shell and reads the file `mkfs` wrote. The fallback is a working machine and
//!   not merely a different boot line.
//! - The disk, read afterwards by this gate rather than by nife, shows slot 1 at `tries=0,
//!   successful=0` with its **priority untouched**. The bits are what the format says they are.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```console
//! $ cargo xtask rollback-boot
//! --- the stick installs itself onto an empty NVMe disk ---
//!   install     : DONE. Remove the installation medium and reboot.
//! rollback-boot: slot 1 written from target/esp-install/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI, on trial
//!                priority 3, 1 try; slot 0 stays at priority 2, confirmed
//! --- boot 2 of 3: the machine tries the upgrade, and the upgrade never comes up ---
//! uefi_loader: boot slots on one disk, 2 of them
//! uefi_loader: starting boot slot 1
//! rollback-boot: killed at the handoff, which is what a hang looks like to the disk
//! --- boot 3 of 3: nobody touched anything ---
//! uefi_loader: starting boot slot 0
//! $ wc made-on-target
//!   1 10 57
//! rollback-boot: slot 1 is priority 3, 0 tries, not successful
//! rollback-boot: PASS
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The upgrade is written by this gate and not by nife**, because nothing in this tree upgrades
//!   a running machine yet. The bytes and the attribute bits go through the same
//!   `crates/boot_slot` and `globally_unique_identifier_partition_table` code the installer uses, so
//!   the *format* is exercised end to end; the program that will one day do this is not.
//! - **One try, not three.** A real upgrade would be given several, and each one is a boot of a TCG
//!   machine. The policy is the same at any count and `cargo test -p boot_slot` covers the counting
//!   in milliseconds.
//! - **It proves nothing about a real firmware**, the same caveat `install-boot` carries. OVMF is
//!   one implementation and a generous one; xenon is where rung 2b's hardware half is settled.
//! - **The power cut it simulates is at the handoff and not during the table write.** A machine
//!   interrupted between the four block writes the chooser makes is the case nothing here covers,
//!   and `uefi_loader/src/chooser.rs`'s `BUGS` says so at the code.
//! - **It takes several minutes under TCG**, three boots of it, so it is not in `script/test`'s
//!   default legs any more than `install-boot` is.
