///   the timer, the scheduler and two ring-3 processes, on a memory map from firmware rather than

///    that were all working.
/// 2. **The prompt.** A row starting `$ `, which the kernel's tour never prints. Sampled, and that
///    is fine: a prompt sits on the screen until somebody types, so it is a state and not an event.
/// 3. **The answer.** [`UEFI_SCREEN_COMMAND`] is written to `serial` (COM1), and a row equal to
///    [`UEFI_SCREEN_ANSWER`] must appear. The command's own echo is `$ echo ...`, a different row,
///    so this row is only there if the shell ran the command and its output reached the screen.
