//! Measured boot: the digest of the boot program, handed to the kernel build (milestone 22 phase
//! B.1, DECISIONS §22).
//!
//! The kernel loads exactly one program itself, the boot program, and until now it loaded whatever
//! bytes it was handed. Now the build measures that entry and the kernel image carries the digest, so
//! the check means "this kernel runs exactly this progenitor." The ordering is one-way and the build
//! already had it: userspace -> archive -> manifest -> kernel. See kernel/build.rs (which consumes
//! the manifest) and notes/trusted-init.md.

/// **`progenitor` is on every list** (milestone 266): one first process, one name, on all three
/// boards. Before that the entry was called `init` and meant a different binary depending on the
/// architecture, and this table was where that showed.
///
/// **`hello` is on every list too, and it is not a boot program in the ordinary sense.** It carries
/// milestone 19d's and 19e's init roles, which are all nine it has left after milestone 291, and
/// `spawn_hello` enters it directly for them; `trust::require`
/// refuses any entry the trust root does not name. A kernel that could enter a program it never
/// measured would be the hole measured boot exists to close, so the entry is here rather than the
/// check being relaxed there.
///
/// **It stopped being per-architecture at milestone 295, and took its `arch` parameter with it.**
/// riscv64 and `x86_64` used to add `builder`, milestone 20's richer-initrd demo, because the
/// RISC-V boot tour entered it directly to prove that userspace composes the system; calef retired
/// that program on 2026-09-14 once milestone 268 made the default riscv64 boot hand over to the
/// progenitor, which makes the same claim at a larger scale. So the kernel now enters exactly two
/// programs on every board, and a trust root that differed by architecture is one fewer thing for a
/// reader to hold.
///
/// The parameter went rather than being kept for a future divergence, because an argument nothing
/// reads is a claim that something varies when nothing does. `write_measure_manifest` still takes
/// an `arch` and still writes one manifest per architecture; if a board's list ever needs to differ
/// again, the parameter comes back at that point with a reason attached. The absent-name path below
/// it is the one that was already written for lists that differ, and it is kept.
