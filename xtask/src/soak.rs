/// **The QEMU rehearsal of milestone 168's multi-tasking workload sweep.** Boot a
/// `--features job_mix` kernel, echo its lines, stop when it says it is done, and kill it.
///
/// **This is a rehearsal and not the measurement**, and the distinction is the milestone's whole
/// gate. Under TCG the magnitudes are fiction (no caches are modelled) and under HVF the host
/// scheduler is underneath every guest thread; the number DECISIONS §96 is waiting for is taken on
/// radon, by `notes/job-mix.md`'s procedure. What this proves is that the workload runs, that the
/// sweep completes, and that the output is the shape the bench evening will read.
///
/// **The judging is `board_console`'s**, not this function's (milestone 324 part 2), which is the
/// same move `soak_test` below already made and for the same reason: a second reader drifts from
/// the bench-side one the first time either changes, and the cheapest way for two things to agree
/// is for there to be one of them. What stood here instead was a loop over `starts_with("job-mix")`
/// with no timeout at all, so a sweep that wedged mid-subrun hung this command forever and a
/// finished sweep and a dead one shared an exit status. That is the limitation milestone 168's lane
/// filed and milestone 324's part 2 names.
///
/// The kernel parks in `wfi` rather than exiting, so the host side owns the process and tears it
/// down; that half is `run_bench`'s and is unchanged. See `script/job-mix`.
