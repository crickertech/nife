/// and its absence produces a confusing "command not found" rather than a real error.
/// **Read a program ELF for packing, with its debug information removed.**
///
/// The initrd is *reserved RAM*: the frame allocator never owns those pages, so every byte in the
/// archive is a byte the running system does not have. And a debug build is almost entirely debug
/// information: `rust_swappable` is 720 KB, of which **3 KB** is `.text` plus `.rodata` and the
/// other 717 KB is `.debug_*`. Twenty-odd programs like that made a 26 MB archive out of well under
/// a megabyte of code, on a machine with 128 MB.
///
/// Nothing ever read those bytes. `crates/elf` parses **program headers only** (it has no
/// section-header code at all), so the loader cannot see a debug section on either side of the
/// boundary; the kernel prints a raw `pc` on a fault and symbolisation is done offline, against the
/// unstripped binary that is still sitting in `target/`. So this is pure waste, and milestone 23 is
/// where it stopped being free: five more programs pushed the archive 4 MB up and a *later,
/// unrelated* test could no longer find a contiguous eight-megabyte region for the progenitor.
///
/// `--strip-debug` rather than `--strip-all`, deliberately: it takes the `.debug_*` sections, which
/// is all of the bulk, and leaves the symbol table for anything that later wants to read it out of
/// the archive rather than out of `target/`.
///
/// A missing `llvm-objcopy` is a hard failure rather than a silent fallback to unstripped bytes,
/// because the measured-boot digest (§26's phase B.1) is taken over what this returns: a build that
/// quietly packed different bytes depending on which tools were installed would be a build whose
/// trust root means something different on each machine.
