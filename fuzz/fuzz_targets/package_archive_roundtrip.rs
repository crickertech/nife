//! Fuzz the package **round trip**: write a package, parse it back, verify every member.
//!
//! DECISIONS §197 (a package is one archive file) accepted a cost out loud when it chose a
//! container: *"the reader owes a fuzz target and the Kani treatment `crates/nifefs` and
//! `crates/elf` already carry."* This is that debt's first half, and it is deliberately the
//! round-trip shape rather than a `package_archive_parse` sibling, for the reason
//! `nifefs_roundtrip` gives at length: the parser's totality is what a Kani harness proves, and
//! what no harness of that shape can prove is that the writer and the reader agree.
//!
//! **The property.** For any set of (name, bytes) the writer accepts, the file it produces parses,
//! holds exactly that many members, reads each name back byte-identical, and passes its own digest
//! check. A package that fails the last one would be a package a verifier refuses for no reason a
//! user could act on, which is the quietest way for a trust mechanism to become noise.
//!
//! **Structured input, not bytes**, again for `nifefs_roundtrip`'s reason: byte mutation would
//! spend the budget on files the writer never writes.
