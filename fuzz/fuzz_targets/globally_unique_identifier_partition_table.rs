//! Fuzz the GUID partition table parser with the head of an arbitrary disk.
//!
//! **Why this target exists.** A partition table is read from a disk somebody else formatted, with
//! somebody else's tool, possibly years ago and possibly on purpose.
//! `crates/globally_unique_identifier_partition_table` is what stands between that and the block
//! layer deciding which LBA range is a filesystem, so every field it trusts is a field an attacker
//! who can hand us a disk image gets to choose.
//!
//! **The input is a disk prefix, not three separate buffers.** Byte 0 onward is LBA 0, so:
//!
//!   * `data[0..512]`      LBA 0, the protective MBR
//!   * `data[512..1024]`   LBA 1, the primary header (its length is the block size, hence 512)
//!   * `data[1024..]`      the entry array
//!
//! That layout is not a convenience. It makes
//! `crates/globally_unique_identifier_partition_table/tests/fixtures/*.head`, which are real disks
//! formatted by `sgdisk` and by Apple's Disk Utility, directly usable as seeds: the fuzzer starts
//! from two tables the format's own tools produced rather than from `[]`.
//!
//! **What it adds over the Kani proofs and the mutation tests.**
//! `crates/globally_unique_identifier_partition_table` is the most heavily checked parser in the
//! tree: eight harnesses, plus exhaustive mutation tests that flip every byte of a real header and
//! a real entry array to every other value, 460,000 validations. Both are
//! *single-field* explorations around a valid table. Neither can build a table whose `entry_size`,
//! `entry_count`, `entry_array_lba`, `first_usable_lba` and `alternate_lba` are hostile
//! **together**, which is where the interesting arithmetic is: `entry_count * entry_size`,
//! `alternate_lba - entry_array_blocks()`, `last_usable_lba > block_count - backup_reserved`. A
//! table that survives the CRC and then makes one of those wrap is exactly what a fuzzer is for and
//! exactly what a single-byte mutation cannot reach, because changing any field invalidates the CRC
//! and the mutation test's job is to prove that the CRC catches it.
