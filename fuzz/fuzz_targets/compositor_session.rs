//! Fuzz the compositor's **frame handling** with sessions of lying clients, and check the screen
//! after every frame (proposal #1592 part a, rank 5).
//!
//! **What runs.** The decode the compositor binary's `serve_frame` runs for each client whose
//! sequence moved (`compositor::commit_damage`, four untrusted control-page words in, screen damage
//! and a status word out), the union of those, and `compositor::composite` into a host screen.
//! A session is a sequence of frames; in each, any client may scribble on its own surface, write
//! any four words as its damage rectangle, and ring (or not).
//!
//! **The rules it checks after every frame**, beyond "no panic":
//!
//! 1. *A lie re-copies only the liar.* A client's damage, whatever four words it wrote, lands inside
//!    its own window on the screen.
//! 2. *An honest status.* `STATUS_OK` only when the rectangle was inside the client's surface.
//! 3. *Only damage changes.* Every screen pixel outside the frame's damage is what it was.
//! 4. *The damage is right.* Every pixel inside it is what the scene says: the topmost committed
//!    window's own pixel there, or the background. No client's pixel reaches another's window.
//!
//! Name: provisional (`lane/fuzz-service-handlers`, 2026-10-04 UTC); an architect names things.
