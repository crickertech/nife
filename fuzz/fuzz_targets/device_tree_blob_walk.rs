//! Fuzz the device-tree parser with arbitrary bytes.
//!
//! **Why this target exists.** The device tree is the one parse in this system that runs before
//! anything else: `kernel/src/main.rs` reads it from the pointer firmware left in a register, on
//! both ISAs, before there is a frame allocator, a scheduler, or a way to report a failure. The
//! bytes are written by QEMU, by OpenSBI, or by a board's firmware, and none of those is us. A panic
//! here is a kernel that cannot boot and cannot say why.
//!
//! **What it adds over the Kani proofs.** `crates/device_tree_blob`'s four harnesses prove the
//! *leaf readers* total: `be32` and `be64` never panic for any offset into any buffer. They
//! deliberately do not reach the seven walkers above them, because a walker is an unbounded loop
//! over a symbolic blob and that is where bounded model checking stops. The walkers are where the
//! state lives: a depth counter, two 16-entry per-depth cell-count stacks, a "which node am I
//! inside" slot. Every one of those is indexed by a number the blob controls.
//!
//! That is not a hypothetical division of labour. This target found a real out-of-bounds index in
//! `node_reg` within seconds of its first run; see `crates/device_tree_blob/tests/hostile.rs`.
//!
//! **Every accessor, not just `from_bytes`.** A blob that parses is not a blob that is safe to walk,
//! and the kernel calls all of these on the same blob during boot. (An earlier draft said "all
//! seven"; the count grows with the parser, and the rule is the walkers below track its public
//! surface.)
