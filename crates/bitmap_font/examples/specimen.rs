//! **A specimen sheet for an 8-pixel-wide bitmap font**: the same text, in every font, so two of
//! them can be compared by looking rather than by reading a table of byte counts.
//!
//! The crate is a pure function from `(byte, x, y)` to ink, which is the property that lets the
//! terminal, the kernel test and the host-side scanout check agree about what a letter looks like
//! (see the crate docs). It is also what makes this possible: if the picture is a function, the
//! picture can be *printed*, and a font choice becomes something a person can look at instead of
//! something they have to take on trust.
//!
//! Run it on what ships:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p bitmap_font --example specimen
//! ```
//!
//! Or on a candidate, in any of the four formats a bitmap font arrives in. GNU Unifont `.hex`
//! (`CODEPOINT:BITS`, one glyph per line), Adobe `.bdf` (what Terminus, Spleen and most X11 bitmap
//! fonts ship as), the `.art` format this tool also reads, which is a `#`/`.` picture per glyph and
//! is the only sane way to *author* one by hand, and a raw character-generator ROM (`.rom`/`.bin`),
//! which is the format a font arrived in before it was a file:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p bitmap_font --example specimen -- --font unscii-8.hex --name unscii-8
//! cargo run -p bitmap_font --example specimen -- --font ter-u16n.bdf --name terminus-16
//! cargo run -p bitmap_font --example specimen -- --font bench/font-options/hand-drawn-8x8.art
//! cargo run -p bitmap_font --example specimen -- --font 81-146a.bin --name kaypro-ii
//! ```
//!
//! **Give `--font` more than once and the fonts are drawn interleaved**, sample line by sample
//! line, with the name in a left gutter. That is the mode a choice is actually made in: two
//! specimens in sections of their own is an inventory, and the eye cannot compare across a scroll.
//! `--metrics` prints the table row for `notes/glyphs.md` instead of asserting the numbers.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p bitmap_font --example specimen -- --metrics \
//!     --font 81-146a.bin --name kaypro-ii --font gohufont-14.bdf --name gohufont-14
//! ```
//!
//! Two rendering modes, and both are needed for different questions. Half blocks (the default) show
//! the font at roughly its real aspect ratio, because a terminal cell is about twice as tall as it
//! is wide and one half block is therefore about square; that is the mode for "does this look
//! good". `--dots` prints one character per pixel, which is the mode for "what exactly is in this
//! glyph", and it is the format the crate's own doctest uses to pin the bit order.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! Half-block output is only faithful if the terminal reading it renders U+2580 and U+2584 at full
//! cell height with no gap. Most do; a few add antialiasing that makes strokes look softer than the
//! font is. `--dots` has no such dependency and disagreeing with it is the tie-breaker.
//!
//! The `.hex` reader takes the low byte of each row and ignores 16-pixel-wide glyphs, because this
//! crate's cell is 8 wide. A 16-wide font loaded here shows its left half, which looks like a
//! clipped font rather than an error. The `.bdf` reader clips the same way, and it reads only
//! the bitmap: `SWIDTH`, `DWIDTH` and the property block are ignored, which is right for a
//! fixed-pitch cell and wrong for anything else.
//!
//! Name: **provisional** (this lane, bench/font-options). "Specimen" is the printing trade's word
//! for exactly this sheet, which is the guard rail the naming tenet keeps, but the name is calef's.

/// Three things are derived from the bytes, and each is checkable by looking at the ROM:

/// - **The used half.** A 2K part often carries a 1K font, and the unused half is uniform. Kaypro's

///   blanking, so the leading uniform 1K-aligned blocks are skipped.
/// - **Rows per glyph**, which is then the used length over 128.
/// - **Inversion.** A font is mostly paper, so if most bits in the used region are set, the part
///   stores ink as zero. MAME says the same thing declaratively with `ROMREGION_INVERT`.
///
/// One thing is a fact about the wiring and is only **inferred** here: how many of the eight data
/// lines reach the shift register. If the top bits are paper in every byte of the font, they are
/// not connected, and the glyph is the remaining span plus one blank gutter column on each side.
/// That gutter is Kaypro's (`kaypro_v.cpp` shifts out `0`, five bits, `0`), not a universal truth.
