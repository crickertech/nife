//! **A 7x8 bitmap font, and the arithmetic that turns a character into pixels** (milestone 29,
//! the display ladder's text).
//!
//! Rung one put pixels on a screen and rung two multiplexed the screen; neither could show a letter.
//! This is the piece that can, and it is deliberately the smallest thing that could: a constant
//! table of monochrome glyphs and a pure function from `(character, x, y)` to a colour.
//!
//! # Why a bitmap font, and not a scalable one
//!
//! A scalable font (TrueType, or `cosmic-text` above it) wants an allocator, floating point, a
//! rasteriser with hinting and anti-aliasing, and a font file to load from a filesystem. Every one
//! of those is a dependency a `no_std`, allocation-free userspace component would have to acquire
//! before it could draw the letter A. A bitmap font needs none of them: the glyphs are a `static`
//! in `.rodata`, drawing one is a bit test, and the whole thing is `const`-shaped enough that the
//! *expected* picture is a function three independent parties can evaluate (the terminal that
//! draws, the kernel test that checks, and the host that reads the scanout back out of QEMU). That
//! last property is what makes the text on the screen provable rather than merely plausible, and it
//! is the reason to start here even though rung three will eventually want the scalable path.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The whole crate is a pure function from `(byte, x, y)` to a colour, so the expected picture can be
//! *printed*. This is the property the section above claims and it is worth showing rather than
//! asserting: a mirrored font is the classic bitmap-font bug and nearly invisible in review, because
//! half the alphabet is symmetric enough to look fine. `F` is not.
//!
//! ```
//! use bitmap_font::{GLYPH_H, GLYPH_W, ink};
//!
//! let art: Vec<String> = (0..GLYPH_H)
//!     .map(|y| (0..GLYPH_W).map(|x| if ink('F', x, y) { '#' } else { '.' }).collect())
//!     .collect();
//!
//! assert_eq!(
//!     art,
//!     [
//!         ".#####.", // the top bar runs the full five ink columns
//!         ".#.....", // the stem is on the LEFT
//!         ".#.....",
//!         ".####..", // the middle bar is one column short, which is what makes it an F
//!         ".#.....",
//!         ".#.....",
//!         ".#.....",
//!         ".......", // row 7 is the descender row, and F has none
//!     ],
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! The first and last columns are blank in **every** glyph, which is the Kaypro's geometry rather
//! than an accident of this letter: five ink columns with a one-pixel gutter each side.
//!
//! Drawing into a framebuffer is [`cell_pixel`] and nothing else. Three independent parties call it
//! for three different reasons, which is why it is a function rather than a method on a canvas: the
//! terminal to paint, the kernel test to predict, and the host-side scanout check to grade what QEMU
//! is actually displaying.
//!
//! ```
//! use bitmap_font::{GLYPH_H, GLYPH_W, cell_pixel};
//!
//! const WHITE: u32 = 0x00ff_ffff;
//! const BLACK: u32 = 0x0000_0000;
//!
//! // The cell at column 3, row 0 of a terminal grid, holding a space.
//! let (col, row) = (3u32, 0u32);
//! for y in 0..GLYPH_H {
//!     for x in 0..GLYPH_W {
//!         assert_eq!(cell_pixel(' ', x, y, WHITE, BLACK), BLACK);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // And the grid arithmetic a fixed-pitch font buys: a pixel's cell is a division.
//! let (px, py) = (col * GLYPH_W + 1, row * GLYPH_H + 1); // column 1 is the F's stem
//! assert_eq!((px / GLYPH_W, py / GLYPH_H), (col, row));
//! assert_eq!(cell_pixel('F', px % GLYPH_W, py % GLYPH_H, WHITE, BLACK), WHITE);
//! ```
//!
//! Out-of-cell coordinates are not ink rather than a panic, because the callers are pixel loops, and
//! a character with no glyph draws a visible box rather than nothing:
//!
//! ```
//! use bitmap_font::{ink, glyph, MISSING};
//!
//! assert!(!ink('F', 7, 0)); // past the cell
//! assert!(!ink('F', 0, 99));
//!
//! // Everything past basic latin (0x80 up, and every non-Latin `char` since milestone 142's UTF-8
//! // increment) draws the missing-glyph box. A reader sees that the text is wrong instead of seeing
//! // a gap.
//! assert_eq!(glyph('\u{e9}'), &MISSING);
//! assert_ne!(glyph('F'), &MISSING);
//! ```
//!
//! # What deliberately is NOT here
//!
//! No kerning, no proportional widths, no anti-aliasing, no Unicode beyond the basic-latin block
//! (see [`glyph`] for what a byte outside it draws), and no font loading: this font is compiled in.
//! The honest limits are listed in notes/glyphs.md.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review). Renamed from
//! `bitfont`: spell out the contraction fully, consistent with this session's other renames,
//! even though `bitfont` was already transparent. `bitfont` itself was one of the five
//! run-together names milestone 63 reviewed on 2026-08-01 (`capsh`, `lineedit`, `uheap`,
//! `nifefs`, `bitfont`) when it deleted the rule that had produced them; three moved, `nifefs`
//! stayed with a reason recorded, and this one stayed unrecorded until now.
