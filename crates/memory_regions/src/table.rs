//! **The region table itself, and the claim that makes reclamation single-winner.**
//!
//! The arithmetic in the crate root ([`split_new_watermark`], [`destroy_outcome`]) is what one
//! caller decides. This module is what happens when there are two, which is a different question
//! and needs a different tool: Kani proves the arithmetic and does not model threads, so the
//! racing case was argued from lock discipline and gated by nothing until milestone 135.
//!
//! # The bug this exists to have caught
//!
//! `memory_region::destroy` used to check the region under the `REGIONS` lock, **release** it, revoke
//! every mapping, free every page, and remove the table slot last. Two callers holding a name for
//! one region (an owner's `MemoryRegion::DESTROY` and a supervisor's `rendezvous::REAP`, both landing in
//! `sched::reclaim_region`) could each pass the refusal check inside that gap and each run the free
//! loop over the same pages. It surfaced once in 45 loaded runs on riscv64 as
//! `double free of frame 0x82a3e000`, and it needed two cores.
//!
//! Pull request #316 fixed it by removing the slot under the same hold that decided to destroy it.
//! This module is that fix made structural: [`RegionTable::claim_for_destroy`] takes `&mut self`
//! and does both, so **the gap is not expressible**. A caller cannot hold a decision without
//! holding the table, because the decision and the removal are one call.
//!
//! # What a claim is
//!
//! [`DestroyClaim`] is the exclusive right to reclaim one region's pages. It is minted only by
//! `claim_for_destroy`, it has no public constructor, and it is not `Copy`, so the kernel's free
//! loop runs against a value nothing else in the system can be holding. Its fields are the ones the
//! caller needs to do the I/O the table cannot do: revoke the mappings, and then either free the run
//! to the frame allocator (a root) or give it back to the parent's budget (a child, via
//! [`RegionTable::return_to_parent`]).
//!
//! # Page numbers, not addresses
//!
//! Everything here is in **page units**, including `base_page`, so the crate stays `FRAME_SIZE`-
//! and address-agnostic exactly as the crate root's doc comment claims. The kernel multiplies.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! The kernel's own shape, minus the I/O:
//!
//! ```
//! use memory_regions::RegionTable;
//!
//! let mut table = RegionTable::<8>::new();
//!
//! // A root region over 16 pages starting at page 0x1000.
//! let root = table.insert_root(0x1000, 16).expect("a free slot");
//!
//! // Carve a child off it. The parent now has a live child and cannot be reclaimed.
//! let child = table.split(root, 4).expect("budget and a slot");
//! assert!(table.claim_for_destroy(root).is_none(), "a parent with a live child refuses");
//!
//! // Reclaim the child: it returns its pages to the parent, never to the allocator.
//! let claim = table.claim_for_destroy(child).expect("a childless, unpinned region");
//! assert!(!claim.is_root(), "a split child is not a root");
//! // ... the kernel revokes claim.base_page()..+claim.pages() here ...
//! table.return_to_parent(&claim);
//!
//! // And now the parent is reclaimable, with the child's pages back in its budget.
//! assert_eq!(table.usage(root), Some((0, 16)));
//! let claim = table.claim_for_destroy(root).expect("no children left");
//! assert!(claim.is_root(), "a created region frees to the allocator");
//! ```
//!
//! The claim is single-winner, which is the whole point:
//!
//! ```
//! use memory_regions::RegionTable;
//!
//! let mut table = RegionTable::<4>::new();
//! let r = table.insert_root(0, 2).unwrap();
//! assert!(table.claim_for_destroy(r).is_some());
//! assert!(table.claim_for_destroy(r).is_none(), "the name stopped resolving at the first claim");
//! ```
//!
//! Name: `RegionTable`, `DestroyClaim`, `insert_root`, `claim_for_destroy` and `return_to_parent`
//! are **provisional**, minted 2026-08-18 by milestone 135's lane and not yet put to calef. Nouns
//! per the naming tenet; `RegionTable` inherits its shape from the crate's own name, ratified
//! 2026-08-23 as `memory_regions` (renamed from the unratified `regions`).

    //!
    //! What loom searches here is the interleaving of **critical sections**, not memory orderings:
    //! this protocol is lock-based, like `wake_handshake` and unlike `steal_request`. That makes it
    //! cheap to search and it makes the model's claim narrower, which the roadmap block says out
    //! loud: the model assumes mutual exclusion and says nothing about whether `IrqSafeMutex`
    //! delivers it.
    //!
    //! The harnesses use `RegionTable<2>` or `<4>` rather than the kernel's 256 because the search
    //! is exponential in the interleavings and nothing in the protocol depends on capacity. Every
    //! other input is the kernel's own: the same `claim_for_destroy`, the same `split`, the same
    //! `retype_page`, compiled from the same source the kernel links.
