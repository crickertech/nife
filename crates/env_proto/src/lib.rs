//! **The inert-configuration contract** (milestone 47's environment-variable fork, DECISIONS
//! §111). One definition of the read-only page that carries `TZ`, `LANG` and `TERM` into a
//! process, so whoever assembles it (init, or a kernel test harness standing in for init today)
//! and whoever reads it (the `std` PAL, and eventually a `no_std` program through `user_rt`)
//! cannot drift. The same split `clock_proto` makes for the wall clock and `fs_proto` makes for
//! the filesystem.
//!
//! # Why a page, and why validated
//!
//! Milestone 47 splits what Unix puts in one string-to-string environment map into three parts:
//! inert configuration (`TZ`, `LANG`, `TERM`, genuinely just data), names (`PATH`, `HOME`,
//! already answered by the namespace half), and secrets (already answered, an endpoint, §41).
//! DECISIONS §111 decided the inert third's wire encoding: a read-only page a process is either
//! granted or is not (the same rights ladder the clock page uses: no capability, or a `Frame`
//! with `READ`), because a config value is never something a person designates on a command
//! line and there is nothing to propose or set from inside the process that holds it.
//!
//! **Why validated rather than a free-form string.** A capability governs reach, not meaning:
//! once a value is bytes on a page, nothing about the capability model can tell a password from
//! a timezone, and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`-as-env-var is a real, repeated Unix problem for exactly that
//! reason. §111's answer is this tree's strongest tool applied to value shape instead of
//! authority: **make the wrong state unrepresentable.** A byte sequence has to parse as a member
//! of a specific, known-safe [`domain`] to go onto this page at all, so an API key does not
//! parse as `America/Los_Angeles` and cannot ride through disguised as one. [`PageBuilder`]'s
//! three setters are where that is enforced, at assembly time, before the page exists to anyone.
//!
//! # The page has one writer, once, before it has a second reader
//!
//! Unlike [`clock_proto`](../clock_proto)'s page, which is published to repeatedly by a running
//! service while readers hold a stale mapping, this page is assembled once, in a buffer nothing
//! else can see, and only *then* mapped read-only into the process that will read it. There is
//! no seqlock here because there is nothing to race: the writer finishes before the page has a
//! second observer. [`ConfigPage::new`]'s contract is the same "stays mapped, never written by
//! this process" shape the clock page's reader relies on; it just does not need the seqlock's
//! seq-and-fence dance to get there.
//!
//! # A zeroed frame reads as "no configuration", by construction
//!
//! [`MAGIC`] is checked before anything else is read, the same default-honest shape
//! `clock_proto::ClockPage` uses: a frame nobody has assembled a page into, or a page belonging
//! to something else entirely, answers `None` for every key rather than inventing a locale
//! nobody chose (DECISIONS §42's no-silent-degradation rule, applied here rather than to time).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Assembling a page is validate-then-write, and an unrecognized value is refused before it
//! reaches the page at all:
//!
//! ```
//! use env_proto::{ConfigPage, PageBuilder, Refused};
//!
//! let page = PageBuilder::new()
//!     .tz("America/Los_Angeles").unwrap()
//!     .lang("en_US.UTF-8").unwrap()
//!     .term("xterm-256color").unwrap()
//!     .build();
//!
//! // SAFETY: `page` is a live, aligned buffer of exactly `PAGE_BYTES`, alive for this block.
//! let read = unsafe { ConfigPage::new(page.as_ptr() as u64) };
//! assert_eq!(read.tz(), Some("America/Los_Angeles"));
//! assert_eq!(read.lang(), Some("en_US.UTF-8"));
//! assert_eq!(read.term(), Some("xterm-256color"));
//!
//! // A value outside the domain is refused when the page is built, not carried through
//! // disguised as configuration.
//! assert_eq!(
//!     PageBuilder::new().tz("definitely-not-a-timezone"),
//!     Err(Refused::UnknownTz),
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! A key nobody declared reads as absent, and a frame nobody has assembled a page into reads as
//! "no configuration" rather than as empty strings:
//!
//! ```
//! use env_proto::{ConfigPage, PageBuilder};
//!
//! let page = PageBuilder::new().tz("UTC").unwrap().build(); // LANG and TERM left undeclared
//! // SAFETY: as above.
//! let read = unsafe { ConfigPage::new(page.as_ptr() as u64) };
//! assert_eq!(read.tz(), Some("UTC"));
//! assert_eq!(read.lang(), None);
//! assert_eq!(read.term(), None);
//!
//! let zeroed = [0u8; env_proto::PAGE_BYTES];
//! // SAFETY: as above.
//! let nothing = unsafe { ConfigPage::new(zeroed.as_ptr() as u64) };
//! assert_eq!(nothing.tz(), None);
//! assert_eq!(nothing.lang(), None);
//! assert_eq!(nothing.term(), None);
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The domains are curated, real, and deliberately not exhaustive.** [`domain::KNOWN_TZ`] is
//!   not the ~600-zone IANA timezone database, [`domain::KNOWN_LANG`] is not glibc's locale
//!   list, and [`domain::KNOWN_TERM`] is not terminfo's. Vendoring any of those wholesale is a
//!   dependency decision (DECISIONS §46) this crate does not make on its own; the lists here are
//!   grown on demand, the same posture `clock_proto::rtc` takes toward RTC bindings. Every entry
//!   is a real, checkable value; the list is short, not fabricated.
//! - **A value longer than its key's cap is a build-time bug, not a runtime refusal.** The
//!   domains are curated short on purpose (§111 does not ask this crate to support arbitrary
//!   IANA identifiers), so every member of every `KNOWN_*` list fits under its field's cap by
//!   construction, and [`PageBuilder::build`] truncates rather than panics if that invariant is
//!   ever violated by a future addition to a domain list. A host test pins it instead: growing a
//!   domain with an over-length member fails the suite, not a process at spawn.
//! - **No wire announcement exists yet**, because nothing that spawns through `grant_plan`'s
//!   shell protocol declares wanting this page: `Manifest` carries no `config` field, the way it
//!   carries `clock` for `date`. What is built end to end is the page format and the kernel- and
//!   `std`-PAL-side wiring that grants it to a std program, proven by `std_exerciser`
//!   (`kernel/src/user/std_service.rs`, `patches/std-nife/overlay/std/src/sys/env/nife.rs`). A
//!   shell-facing program that wants a declared key, and the `caps` preview extension §111 also
//!   asks for, wait on a real customer the way `clock` waited on `date`.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Provisional, minted 2026-08-23 by this lane and not yet put to calef. Chosen
//! for consistency with the tree's own `*_proto` convention for a wire-contract crate a service
//! and its readers share (`clock_proto`, `fs_proto`, `gfx_proto`, `entropy_proto`): this crate is
//! exactly that shape, one page's layout and the validated domains a value must belong to before
//! it goes on it, shared by whoever assembles a page and whoever reads one. `env` is the stem
//! Unix's own vocabulary already uses for this concept (`/usr/bin/env`, `environ`), and no other
//! crate in this tree has claimed it.
