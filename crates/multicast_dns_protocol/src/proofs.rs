//! Machine-checked proofs (Kani), run by `script/verify`. The property that earns its solver time
//! here is the one a fuzzer can only gesture at: the name decoder is fed by anyone on the local
//! network, and it must terminate and stay in bounds on **every** byte string, not just on the
//! packets a working stack produces. The compression-pointer loop is the classic DNS-parser hang;
//! the decoder's strictly-backwards fence turns it into an error, and the first harness quantifies
//! that claim over every message of the proved size.
//!
//! The bound is small (the harnesses quantify over short buffers) and that is the same trade
//! `gpt`'s CRC harnesses record: what is being proved is the *structure* (termination, bounds,
//! round-tripping), which does not grow new behaviour with length; the realistic lengths are
//! covered by the tests over real captured packets.

/// and the content walk force byte-precise reasoning about the 255-byte output array. The decoder
/// was therefore split (`decode_name_into`) so the identical loop can be proved against a small
/// output, which is where the cost lived; the capacity only decides where `NameTooLong` fires,
