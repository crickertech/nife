//! PCI configuration space: the decode logic, and none of the MMIO.
//!
//! This crate knows how ECAM addressing works, how to walk a config space for devices, how to
//! size a BAR, and how to find the virtio vendor capabilities. It deliberately does not know how
//! to *touch* any of it: every function takes read/write closures over `(bdf, offset)`, and the
//! kernel passes volatile accessors into the mapped ECAM window while the tests pass a fake
//! config space built in an array. The same inversion `validate_and_shadow` uses in
//! kernel/src/virtio.rs, and the reason all of this is host-testable.
//!
//! Vocabulary, because PCI is fifty years of acronyms: a function is addressed by **BDF**
//! (bus, device, function). Each function has 4 KB of **configuration space** (ECAM: a flat
//! memory window, 4 KB per function, `(bus << 20) | (dev << 15) | (fn << 12)`). The first 64
//! bytes are the standardized header: vendor/device id, command/status, class, the **BARs**
//! (Base Address Registers, where the function's register blocks live in memory), and the
//! capability list pointer. Everything virtio-modern needs beyond that lives in **vendor
//! capabilities** in that list. See notes/pcie.md.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Enumerating a bus with no bus. Every function here takes read/write closures over
//! `(bdf, offset)`, so the kernel passes volatile accessors into the mapped ECAM window and a test
//! passes an array. **That inversion is why this crate is host-testable at all**, so it is what an
//! example should show:
//!
//! ```
//! use pci::{Bdf, VENDOR_ID, VIRTIO_VENDOR, enumerate};
//!
//! // A config space with exactly one device: modern virtio-blk at 00:01.0. Everything else reads
//! // 0xffff, which is the bus's way of saying nobody is home.
//! let mut read32 = |bdf: Bdf, off: u64| -> u32 {
//!     if bdf == (Bdf { bus: 0, dev: 1, func: 0 }) && off == VENDOR_ID {
//!         (0x1042 << 16) | VIRTIO_VENDOR as u32 // device 0x1042 in the high half
//!     } else if off == VENDOR_ID {
//!         0xffff_ffff
//!     } else {
//!         0 // header type 0: single function, so functions 1..8 are skipped
//!     }
//! };
//!
//! let mut found = Vec::new();
//! enumerate(1, &mut read32, &mut |bdf, vendor, device| {
//!     found.push((bdf, vendor, device));
//! });
//!
//! assert_eq!(found.len(), 1);
//! let (bdf, vendor, device) = found[0];
//! assert_eq!((vendor, device), (VIRTIO_VENDOR, 0x1042));
//!
//! // ECAM addressing: 4 KB per function, `bus:8 | dev:5 | fn:3 | offset:12`. This shift-and-or is
//! // the whole of the spec.
//! assert_eq!(bdf.ecam_offset(), 1 << 15);
//!
//! // And the requester id, which is the key an IOMMU looks the device up by. Both `virt` boards
//! // publish an identity `iommu-map`, so this number is exactly what the IOMMU sees.
//! assert_eq!(bdf.requester_id(), 0b0000_0000_0000_1000);
//! ```
//!
//! The INTx swizzle is four lines and worth pinning, because getting it wrong misroutes an interrupt
//! to a device that will never acknowledge it:
//!
//! ```
//! use pci::intx_irq;
//!
//! // Four devices, each on INTA, spread across four interrupt inputs rather than sharing one.
//! let base = 32;
//! let spread: Vec<u32> = (0..4).map(|dev| intx_irq(base, dev, 1)).collect();
//! assert_eq!(spread, vec![32, 33, 34, 35]);
//!
//! // The swizzle wraps, which is what makes it a swizzle rather than an offset.
//! assert_eq!(intx_irq(base, 4, 1), 32);
//! // And one device's four pins also spread, so a multi-function card does not self-collide.
//! assert_eq!(intx_irq(base, 0, 4), 35);
//! ```
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, the naming tenet in CLAUDE.md). Named in the group of standard
//! terms that are already right and must not be touched, because a name a reader knows from outside
//! this project costs nothing to learn and renaming it would destroy the recognition the tenet
//! exists to buy.
