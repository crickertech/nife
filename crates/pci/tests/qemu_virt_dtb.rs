//! The kernel's PCIe windows come from the tree at boot (`memory::init` reads the

//! `mem32_window`); the tests here run the same reads over the fixture trees and pin the
//! answers, so a QEMU layout change fails on the host before the kernel maps the wrong window
//! on the machine. What is still a hardcode under witness: `PCI_IRQ_BASE` in each
//! kernel/src/arch/*/mmu.rs and the swizzle in this crate (`intx_irq`); a bare-metal crate
//! cannot be a dev-dependency, so those values are asserted as literals, the same
//! hardcode-with-a-witness pattern as the UART test in the dtb crate.
