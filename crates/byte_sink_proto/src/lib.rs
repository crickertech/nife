//! **The byte-sink contract** (milestone 50): one framing for *write these bytes there*.
//!
//! Before this crate there were four of them. std's `println!` SENT three registers on the
//! endpoint in slot 1; `line_editor` CALLed with an opcode and a shared page; `filesystem_proto` CALLed with
//! a handle, an offset and a shared page; the console server took a length on one endpoint and
//! acknowledged on another. Four shapes for one verb, which is exactly as many as it takes to make
//! a program's output destination something the program has to *know about*. This is the one
//! shape, and the point of having it is negative: a writer stops being able to tell what is
//! underneath.
//!
//! # The shape, and why it is this one
//!
//! **A sink is an `Endpoint` capability with `WRITE`, and nothing else.** Not an endpoint plus a
//! shared page, not an endpoint plus an acknowledgement channel. That restriction is the whole
//! design, because milestone 50's finding is that redirection is *putting a different capability in
//! a slot*: the moment a sink needs a page mapped at an agreed address, substituting one for
//! another stops being one grant and starts being a spawn-time negotiation, and the finding is
//! gone.
//!
//! It follows that the payload rides in registers. A message carries up to [`INLINE_MAX`] bytes in
//! two words, with the opcode and the length in the first, which is the three-word fastpath
//! notes/abi.md §2 describes and the one std's stdout already used.
//!
//! **`SEND`, not `CALL`.** A `CALL` would tell the writer how many bytes the sink took, and it
//! would cost a round trip on the hottest path in the system to say "all of them", which is the
//! only answer a self-framing message has. Back-pressure is not lost by dropping the reply,
//! because `SEND` blocks until a receiver takes the message: the rendezvous *is* the flow control,
//! which is the property `line_editor::proto::OP_BYTES` already documented. And it is what lets the
//! reader of a pipe be an ordinary program that does nothing but `recv`, with no reply to send and
//! no protocol knowledge at all.
//!
//! # What a writer learns, which is the one thing it must
//!
//! A sink that has ended is not the same fact as a sink that was never granted, and [`Sent`] is
//! that distinction:
//!
//! - **[`Sent::NoSink`]**: the slot is empty (or holds something that is not a writable endpoint).
//!   This program was not given an output destination. Writing into the void is correct; every OS
//!   does it to a process whose stdout is closed, and the program keeps running.
//! - **[`Sent::Gone`]**: there *was* a sink and it has been destroyed. The reader exited, its
//!   endpoint died with it (DECISIONS §16 revocation), and the bytes have nowhere to go. **The
//!   writer must end.** This is Unix's `SIGPIPE`, arriving as a return code rather than a signal,
//!   for the same reason milestone 48 retired `SIGTTIN`: the question the signal answered is
//!   already answered by who holds what.
//!
//! Unix needs a signal here because an anonymous file descriptor gives the kernel no other way to
//! reach a writer that is not making a syscall. A capability system has a better channel: the
//! writer *is* making a syscall, on a capability the kernel can see is dead.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A writer chunks; the sink reassembles. Sixteen bytes per message is not a tuning parameter, so
//! an example that writes more than that is the honest one:
//!
//! ```
//! use byte_sink_proto::{INLINE_MAX, Msg, eof, pack, unpack};
//!
//! let line = b"the quick brown fox\n"; // 20 bytes, so two messages and an EOF
//! let mut messages = 0;
//! let mut received = [0u8; 32];
//! let mut got = 0;
//! let mut ended = false;
//!
//! let mut rest = &line[..];
//! while !rest.is_empty() {
//!     let (w0, w1, w2, taken) = pack(rest);
//!     messages += 1;
//!     rest = &rest[taken..]; // `pack` never drops a tail silently; the count says what it took
//!
//!     // The other end of the SEND.
//!     let mut buf = [0u8; INLINE_MAX];
//!     match unpack(w0, w1, w2, &mut buf) {
//!         Msg::Bytes(n) => {
//!             received[got..got + n].copy_from_slice(&buf[..n]);
//!             got += n;
//!         }
//!         Msg::Eof | Msg::Malformed => unreachable!(),
//!     }
//! }
//! // The writer is finished, and says so rather than leaving it to be inferred.
//! let (w0, w1, w2) = (eof(), 0, 0);
//! if let Msg::Eof = unpack(w0, w1, w2, &mut [0u8; INLINE_MAX]) {
//!     ended = true;
//! }
//!
//! assert_eq!(messages, 2); // 16 + 4
//! assert_eq!(&received[..got], line);
//! assert!(ended);
//! ```
//!
//! Two claims in the constants are worth checking in code rather than trusting in prose. The first
//! is why [`OP_BYTES`] is zero: with that opcode the first word **is** the byte count, which is
//! bit-for-bit the framing std's stdout sent before this crate existed, so unifying the protocol
//! cost no instruction on the hottest path in the system. The second is that a length the message
//! cannot hold is refused rather than obeyed, because obeying it is a read past the end of a
//! buffer:
//!
//! ```
//! use byte_sink_proto::{INLINE_MAX, Msg, OP_BYTES, len, op, pack, req, unpack};
//!
//! let (w0, ..) = pack(b"hi");
//! assert_eq!(w0, 2); // the whole word, not just its low bits
//! assert_eq!(op(w0), OP_BYTES);
//! assert_eq!(len(w0), 2);
//!
//! // A writer claiming more bytes than three words can carry is malformed, not generous.
//! let lying = req(OP_BYTES, INLINE_MAX as u64 + 1);
//! assert_eq!(unpack(lying, 0, 0, &mut [0u8; INLINE_MAX]), Msg::Malformed);
//! ```
//!
//! # What this contract deliberately does not carry
//!
//! **A per-write error code.** A sink that cannot accept bytes any more says so by ceasing to
//! exist, and a disk-full file sink is required to destroy its receiving end rather than reply
//! with an errno. That collapses "the reader exited", "the device is gone" and "the file system is
//! full" into one fact, and the honest caveat is that the writer loses the *reason*: it learns that
//! this sink is over, not why. That is the right trade for a byte stream, whose only available
//! response to any of the three is to stop, and it is the trade Unix makes too (a writer gets
//! `EPIPE`, never the reader's reason). A sink whose failures a client must distinguish is not a
//! sink; it is a service, and it should be a `CALL` protocol like `filesystem_proto`.
//!
//! **Types.** This carries bytes. A method implies an object with a type, and typed pipelines are a
//! separate and larger fork (design/roadmap/50-pipes-and-redirection.md records it as one); nothing in
//! this framing should be read as a step toward one.
//!
//! **Seeking, truncating, re-reading, or stat.** A sink appends. That is the payoff milestone 50
//! claims over Unix: `> report.txt` hands a program strictly less than fd 1 with full file
//! semantics does, and it is this crate's opcode list that makes the claim true rather than
//! policy.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review). Renamed from
//! `sink_proto`: matches the crate's own opening line ("the byte-sink contract").
