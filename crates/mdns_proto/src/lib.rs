#![no_std]
// milestone 68's ratchet is workspace-wide (§107); this crate opts out until its 41-item
// worklist (notes/doc-coverage.md) is burned down.
#![allow(missing_docs)]
//! **The mDNS/DNS-SD wire format** (RFC 6762, RFC 6763), as pure computation, for milestone 55's
//! Time Machine advertisement.
//!
//! A Mac will not offer a server in its backup-disk list unless the server announces itself over
//! multicast DNS: `_smb._tcp` (the file service), `_adisk._tcp` (the Time Machine flags, which are
//! what populate the list), and `_device-info._tcp` (the model string, which picks the icon). This
//! crate is the bytes and the decisions over them, with no socket, no timer and no policy: the same
//! split `ntp_proto` and `filesystem_proto` make for their contracts, so the parser, the name compression
//! handling and the response logic are host-tested in milliseconds and Kani-checked, rather than
//! debugged inside a QEMU boot against a live Mac. The responder program that joins `224.0.0.251`
//! and carries these bytes needs network-stack surface the tree does not have yet; notes/mdns.md
//! records exactly what is missing and why the program is a later phase.
//!
//! # The reference is measured, not derived
//!
//! calef's router (GL.iNet GL-BE9300, the working family Time Machine server) was queried on
//! 2026-08-15 and its actual response bytes are this crate's primary test vectors; the hex lives in
//! the tests and in notes/mdns.md. Three facts from the capture that reading the RFCs would not
//! give:
//!
//! - **One `_adisk._tcp` instance carries every share.** The disks are enumerated *inside* its TXT
//!   record (`dk0=adVN=corinne,adVF=0x82`, `dk1=adVN=chris,adVF=0x82`, `sys=adVF=0x100`), never one
//!   announcement per share. Two disks is the measured truth of the reference as of 2026-08-15.
//! - **The `_adisk` and `_device-info` SRV records advertise port 0.** They carry flags and a model
//!   string, not a service; the connectable port (445) is `_smb._tcp`'s.
//! - **The model string is `MacSamba`, not `TimeCapsule`.** The router's Samba config says
//!   `fruit:model = TimeCapsule`, and its mDNS `_device-info` TXT says `model=MacSamba` anyway:
//!   the SMB-side knob and the mDNS advertisement are separate mechanisms, and a working family
//!   backup runs with them disagreeing. So the model is data here, never a constant.
//!
//! The flag values (`0x82`, `0x100`) and every TXT key are **data supplied by the caller**, with
//! the captured values used as test vectors. The capture is the authority; when a future capture
//! disagrees with a convenience function here, [`txt_rdata`] takes arbitrary entries and the
//! convenience is the thing to fix.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! ```text
//!   &[u8] ──Reader──► Header, Question*, Record*        (decodes compressed names)
//!   Builder ──question/answer/additional──► &[u8]       (emits uncompressed names only)
//!   Advertisement ──respond(query)──► Option<response>  (the responder's whole decision)
//!   Advertisement ──announcement(svc)──► response       (unsolicited, RFC 6762 §8.3)
//! ```
//!
//! [`respond`] is the function the eventual responder program wraps in a socket loop: it takes one
//! received message and the advertisement's data, and produces either the full response datagram or
//! the decision to stay silent. Everything RFC 6762 makes conditional on the *source* of the query
//! (a legacy querier's port is not 5353) is a [`QuerySource`] the caller supplies, because the
//! crate never sees a socket.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The whole responder, minus the socket. A Mac browsing for backup targets sends a PTR query for
//! `_adisk._tcp.local`, and what comes back is what populates its list:
//!
//! ```
//! use mdns_proto::{
//!     Advertisement, Builder, CLASS_IN, Disk, QuerySource, Reader, SERVICE_ADISK, respond, rrtype,
//!     name_from_dotted, txt_strings,
//! };
//!
//! // The two shares the family actually backs up, and the reference's measured flag values.
//! let disks = [
//!     Disk { volume: "corinne", flags: "0x82" },
//!     Disk { volume: "chris", flags: "0x82" },
//! ];
//! let adv = Advertisement {
//!     host: "patagonia",
//!     smb_port: 445,
//!     disks: &disks,
//!     sys_flags: "0x100",
//!     model: "MacSamba",
//!     ipv4: Some([192, 168, 1, 20]),
//! };
//!
//! // What a browsing Mac puts on the wire.
//! let mut qbuf = [0u8; 512];
//! let mut q = Builder::query(&mut qbuf).unwrap();
//! q.question(name_from_dotted(SERVICE_ADISK).unwrap().as_bytes(), rrtype::PTR, CLASS_IN).unwrap();
//! let qlen = q.finish();
//!
//! let mut rbuf = [0u8; 1472];
//! let n = respond(&adv, &qbuf[..qlen], &mut rbuf, QuerySource::Multicast)
//!     .unwrap()
//!     .expect("we are authoritative for _adisk._tcp");
//!
//! // Both shares ride inside ONE instance's TXT record. That is the measured shape of the
//! // reference, and the thing reading RFC 6763 would not tell you.
//! let mut r = Reader::new(&rbuf[..n]).unwrap();
//! let mut entries = 0;
//! for _ in 0..r.header.qdcount {
//!     r.question().unwrap();
//! }
//! let records = r.header.ancount + r.header.nscount + r.header.arcount;
//! for _ in 0..records {
//!     let rec = r.record().unwrap();
//!     if rec.rrtype == rrtype::TXT {
//!         for s in txt_strings(rec.rdata) {
//!             if s.unwrap().starts_with(b"dk") {
//!                 entries += 1;
//!             }
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! assert_eq!(entries, 2);
//! ```
//!
//! Silence is an answer, and it is the common one: a responder says nothing about a name it is not
//! authoritative for, rather than replying that it does not know.
//!
//! ```
//! # use mdns_proto::{
//! #     Advertisement, Builder, CLASS_IN, QuerySource, respond, rrtype, name_from_dotted,
//! # };
//! # let adv = Advertisement {
//! #     host: "patagonia", smb_port: 445, disks: &[], sys_flags: "0x100", model: "MacSamba",

//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Names are emitted uncompressed.** Legal: RFC 1035 §4.1.4 makes decompression mandatory for
//!   receivers and compression optional for senders. It costs bytes (the reference router's 199-byte
//!   `_adisk` response would be ~280 here), well inside the 1472-byte mDNS budget for this record
//!   set, and it keeps the emitter simple enough to prove things about. Decompression is fully
//!   handled on the read side.
//! - **Known-answer suppression is implemented for the PTR browse answers only** (the records a
//!   browsing Mac re-queries every few minutes, which is the traffic that matters). A known answer
//!   for a SRV/TXT/A record is ignored and the record re-sent, which is chatty, not wrong.
//! - **[`respond`] handles one advertisement.** Three shares is one advertisement (measured, above);
//!   a second *server identity* on one responder is out of scope.
//! - **Probing and announcing are the bytes, not the state machine.** [`probe_query`],
//!   [`conflicts`], [`tiebreak`] and [`announcement`] are the wire-format halves of RFC 6762 §8;
//!   the 250 ms probe timing, the three-probe count, the two-to-eight repeats of an announcement
//!   at doubling intervals, and the rate limiting all live with whoever owns a clock.
//! - **[`announcement`] emits one service type per call**, because this tree's 576-byte MTU cannot
//!   carry all three in one datagram. Legal (a responder may announce in as many messages as it
//!   likes) and slightly chattier than a fatter transport would need.
//! - **TC-bit handling is absent.** A query with the truncation bit set asks the responder to delay
//!   for more known answers; this crate answers it immediately. Harmless (an extra response), and
//!   recorded so nobody mistakes the omission for a decision.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Provisional, minted by milestone 55's mDNS lane on 2026-08-15. The `_proto`
//! suffix is the tree's rule for a wire contract (notes/naming.md); the stem is the protocol's own
//! name (RFC 6762), the same derivation that produced `ntp_proto`. Not yet put to calef.
