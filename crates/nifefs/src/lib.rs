//! **nifefs**: a filesystem so simple it fits in a comment.
//!
//! Read-only, flat (no directories), fixed-size everything. It exists to be *parsed*, not to be
//! good, in the same spirit as `crates/elf`: the point of milestone 9 is drivers and block I/O,
//! not filesystem design, so the on-disk format is the least thing that is still a real
//! filesystem.
//!
//! Pure logic, host-tested, no `std`. The kernel's disk tool writes an image with [`write_image`]
//! and the userspace filesystem server reads it with [`Fs::parse`], so **one definition of the
//! format serves both**, and a test writes an image and reads it back.
//!
//! # The layout
//!
//! ```text
//!   blocks 0..DIR_BLOCKS   the superblock and directory
//!     magic   "CRKR0002"   (8 bytes)
//!     count   u32 LE       how many files          <- HEADER_LEN = 12 bytes so far
//!     ...then `count` directory entries, each ENTRY_LEN = 40 bytes:
//!       name        NAME_LEN = 32 bytes, NUL-padded
//!       start_block u32 LE  where the file's data begins (an absolute block number)
//!       len         u32 LE  the file's length in bytes
//!
//!   blocks DIR_BLOCKS..     file data, each file block-aligned
//! ```
//!
//! The directory is [`DIR_BLOCKS`] blocks, holding the magic, the count, and up to [`MAX_FILES`]
//! entries. It grew from one block to two under DECISIONS §24 (interrupting the foreground
//! process), when the interactive system plus its demo programs passed fifteen files; to four on
//! 2026-07-30 (three lanes landing together made 32); and to six on 2026-08-01 when the entries
//! got wider. `start_block` is an absolute block number, so a
//! reader never needs to know `DIR_BLOCKS` to find data; only the writer places it.
//!
//! # Names
//!
//! A name is at most [`NAME_LEN`] bytes and is **not** NUL-terminated when it uses all of them, so a
//! reader compares against `NAME_LEN` bytes and stops at the first NUL if there is one.
//! [`write_image`] refuses a longer name rather than truncating it; see BUGS.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! Pack two files and read one back:
//!
//! ```
//! # use nifefs::{Fs, image_size, write_image};
//! let files: [(&str, &[u8]); 2] = [("motd", b"welcome\n"), ("os_primitives_benchmarker", b"\x7fELF")];
//! let mut img = vec![0u8; image_size(&files)];
//! write_image(&files, &mut img).unwrap();
//!
//! let fs = Fs::parse(&img).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(fs.read("motd"), Some(&b"welcome\n"[..]));
//! assert_eq!(fs.len(), 2);
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A name longer than [`NAME_LEN`] is an error, not a truncation.** It used to be silently
//!   truncated, which is the worse failure: two long names that agree in their first `NAME_LEN`
//!   bytes become one entry, and `init` loads whichever program happened to be packed first. The
//!   build now stops with [`Error::NameTooLong`].
//! - **A name containing a NUL is an error too**, and for the same reason: the padding is NUL and
//!   every reader stops at the first one, so `"a\0b"` would be written and read back as `"a"`.
//!   [`Error::NameHasNul`]. This one survived the truncation fix because nobody thought to write a
//!   name with a NUL in it; `fuzz/fuzz_targets/nifefs_roundtrip` did, in under a minute.
//! - **A duplicate name is NOT an error, and the first one wins.** [`Fs::read`] returns the first
//!   entry whose name matches, so packing two files under one name silently hides the second. The
//!   disk tool builds its file list from a directory listing, where names are unique by
//!   construction, which is why this has never bitten; nothing in the format prevents it.
//! - **[`MAX_FILES`] is a ceiling that grows with the SUITE, not with the system**, so the cost is
//!   invisible to each branch that causes it and lands on whoever merges. Three lanes landing
//!   together on 2026-07-30 pushed the archive from 31 files to 32 and forced a directory resize.
//! - **A reader holding one block cannot see the whole directory.** The EL0 blk driver
//!   (`crates/virtio`) buffers block 0 only, so it can find the first
//!   [`ENTRIES_IN_FIRST_BLOCK`] files and no more. It is used on the tiny test disk, not the
//!   initrd, but the limit is real and nothing in the format announces it.
//! - **No directories, no writes, no permissions.** This is a boot archive. The read-write
//!   filesystem is the RedoxFS server in `fs_server/` (DECISIONS §34), which is a different job.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 as `crickerfs` (calef, milestone 63): the one run-together name kept
//! when that rule was deleted. Refused `cricker_fs` (`procfs` is the shape of a filesystem name
//! outside this project, and nobody writes `proc_fs`). Renamed `nifefs` with the OS (calef,
//! milestone 120, 2026-08-15); the run-together reasoning carried over unchanged.
