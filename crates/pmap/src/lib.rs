//! **`pmap`: what a process's mappings are when there is no `/proc/pid/maps`** (milestone 126,
//! notes/process-view.md, DECISIONS §114).
//!
//! This is the program's logic, lifted out so it runs on the host in milliseconds; `user/src/pmap.rs`
//! is the syscall and the two output streams and nothing else. The crate and the program share a
//! name because they are one thing split at the IO boundary, the same convention `crates/ps` and
//! `user/src/ps.rs` follow.
//!
//! # What it does not do, which is the whole point
//!
//! `pmap <pid>` on Linux reads `/proc/<pid>/maps`, gated only by ptrace permission checks bolted on
//! after the fact (`yama`'s `ptrace_scope`, `hidepid`): the file exists ambiently and the checks are a
//! later patch over a design that assumed none were needed. Here the listing is a **capability**.
//! What this crate is handed is a function that reads one entry of an address space's mappings, and
//! that function is backed by `abi::address_space::LIST` on an address-space capability the program was
//! endowed. It cannot widen the space, cannot ask about a `va` in a space it was not shown, and
//! cannot discover that any other space exists.
//!
//! # `ENUMERATE`, not `WRITE`, is `ps`'s split one object type over
//!
//! `abi::address_space::MAP_INTO` needs `WRITE`: the authority to shape a space. `abi::address_space::LIST` needs
//! `ENUMERATE`: the authority to look. A capability holding `ENUMERATE` alone can list every mapping
//! and change none of them, exactly the split `Rendezvous::SURVEY` drew between naming a domain's
//! members and reaping one (DECISIONS §114, `notes/process-view.md`).
//!
//! # Three answers, and telling them apart is the deliverable
//!
//! Same three as `ps`, one object type over: a space with mappings in it, a space that is empty
//! (including one whose registry entry is already gone -- see this crate's `BUGS`), and a refusal.
//!
//! # Collect first, complain second, print third
//!
//! DECISIONS §67's rule, verbatim from `crates/ps`: everything a program has to complain about is
//! said, and that stream closed, before a byte of output. [`collect`] takes the whole listing into a
//! caller-provided buffer first for the identical reason `ps::collect` does (`script/stack-frame-check`
//! made the buffer the caller's there; the same shape is kept here from the start rather than found
//! the hard way twice).
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! Driving it from a host test is the whole contract, and it needs no kernel:
//!
//! ```
//! use pmap::{MAX_ROWS, Row, collect};
//!
//! // A space of one mapping: cursor 0 yields it, cursor 1 says done.
//! let mut reader = |cursor: u64| match cursor {
//!     0 => (1, 0x0040_0000, abi::address_space::MAP_CODE),
//!     _ => (abi::survey::DONE as i64, 0, 0),
//! };
//! let mut rows = [Row::default(); MAX_ROWS];
//! let listing = collect(&mut rows, &mut reader);
//! assert_eq!(listing.rows().len(), 1);
//! assert_eq!(listing.rows()[0].va, 0x0040_0000);
//!
//! let mut text = Vec::new();
//! listing.write_report(&mut |b| text.extend_from_slice(b));
//! assert!(String::from_utf8(text).unwrap().contains("r-x"));
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **There is no VA range column, only one row per page.** `abi::address_space::LIST` walks the space's
//!   revocation log, which records one entry per mapped page and nothing about adjacency; upstream
//!   `pmap` coalesces contiguous same-permission pages into a range. Doing that here would need this
//!   crate to know the pages are contiguous, and the log does not promise an order that makes that
//!   cheap to detect. Left as one row per page, which is honest about what the log actually holds.
//! - **No size column beyond the implicit one page**, for the same reason.
//! - **A `DeviceFrame` mapping reads as `rw-`**, the same as an ordinary read/write page: `kind` is
//!   derived from `paging::Flags`, and a device mapping's flags do not carry a bit for "this is
//!   device memory" as far as this crate can see. `pmap` cannot tell a driver's MMIO window from an
//!   ordinary heap page. See `abi::address_space::LIST`'s doc.
//! - **A resumed cursor can land on a slot the space's own log recycled for an unrelated mapping**,
//!   if a tombstoned entry was reused between two calls. Unlike `ps`'s slot table, a log entry
//!   carries no generation to detect this. See `kernel::revoke::list_mapping`'s doc for the mechanism
//!   and why it is accepted rather than fixed here.
//! - **There is no address space this program can be granted at the interactive prompt.** Every
//!   `Object::AddressSpace` capability in this tree today is minted and consumed within the same thread
//!   (`RETYPE_OBJ(ADDRESS_SPACE)` -> `MAP_INTO`* -> `ThreadControlBlock::CONFIGURE`, which removes the space from the
//!   registry the moment it binds to a thread), and nothing in the shipped tree ever delegates one to
//!   a different program. So unlike `ps`, which the shell endows a live supervision endpoint (
//!   `Manifest::domain`), `pmap` has no analogous manifest field and no wiring in
//!   `system_initializer`, because there is no source it could plumb through: no address space
//!   anywhere in this system survives long enough, held by anyone other than its own builder, for a
//!   second program to be handed a view of it. The kernel method and this program are real and
//!   proven end to end against a real `Object::AddressSpace` (`kernel::user::pmap_tests`), the same way
//!   `ps`'s kernel tests prove `Rendezvous::SURVEY` without going through the shell. What is missing is
//!   a design for a builder to hand a narrowed, still-live view to a third party before it consumes
//!   its own capability at `CONFIGURE` -- a real gap this milestone found rather than one it created,
//!   named here for whoever picks it up next rather than decided by this lane. See
//!   notes/process-view.md.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review, confirming milestone
//! 126's own reasoning). `pmap` is the name every reader already knows from outside this project.
//! Sharing it with `user/src/pmap.rs` is the crate-and-program pair the naming tenet describes:
//! `ps`, `coremark`, `line_editor` and `compositor` all keep one name across the two.
