// `Result<_, ()>` is deliberate throughout the build path, and clippy's `result_unit_err` is asking
// for an error type this layer has nothing to put in. Every failure here is a syscall that already
// returned its own error to the caller through the ABI; a second, richer error would be inventing
// detail the kernel did not provide. The unit is honest: it means "the syscall said no", and the
// caller's recourse is the same regardless of which one.
//
// Per-crate rather than per-item because it is one decision about one calling convention, and
// DECISIONS §38's rule is against blanket dead-code suppression hiding unreachable code, which this
// is not: nothing here is hidden, and the lint is a style opinion about an error type.

// spelling for the same thing in a crate whose whole job is that two binaries agree on one

// retention declaration precisely so that nothing supplies one silently.
#![allow(clippy::new_without_default)]
//! **The supervision tree: the shared half** (milestone 22 phase B.2).
//!
//! Three programs make up the tree that shrinks init's authority (`root_supervisor`, `spawner`, `sub_server_supervisor`,
//! plus the `flaky` sub-server they manage), and this is what they share: the protocol words they
//! speak, and the userspace ELF loader they build children with.
//!
//! **The loader here is the tree's only one** (milestone 96). It began as a generalization of
//! `system_initializer`'s `build_child` while the two inits kept copies of their own, which meant
//! the same hundred and thirty lines existed three times with a fault slot each. Milestone 22's
//! lane recorded that and declined to unify it mid-flight, because a boot failure would then have
//! been ambiguous between two changes; `system_initializer` calls this one now, and nothing else builds
//! a process in userspace.
//!
//! What it takes: the builder's own budget and the budget the child is built *from* as separate
//! arguments (they are the same for a server building out of its own memory, and different for a
//! spawner building each child in its own reclaimable region), a capability for the reserved fault
//! slot so the child is born supervised, capabilities for **named** slots the caller picks, and
//! **blobs** to copy into the child. That last one is what lets a construction sub-server hold
//! exactly the one program image it is allowed to build, instead of the whole initrd.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! **A caveat first, because it is a limitation rather than a footnote.** This crate takes an
//! unconditional `user_rt` dependency, so `script/test`'s host pass excludes it (the exclusion list
//! is in `xtask` and is derived and checked by `script/lint`). The examples below run under
//! `cargo test --doc -p supervision_proto` on an aarch64 host and **are not checked by the gate**.
//!
//! [`ChildEndowment`] is the crate's real interface, and reading one is meant to tell you the
//! complete authority of the thing about to run, **in both directions**: what the child is given,
//! and what its spawner keeps over it once it does (DECISIONS §142). Every field is public and
//! there is a nothing-endowment to build from, which is what keeps a later field from being a
//! change to every caller:
//!
//! ```
//! use supervision_proto::{CHILD_STACK_PAGES, ChildEndowment, Retention};
//!
//! // A sub-server that gets exactly one endpoint, is born supervised, and holds nothing else.
//! // `..ChildEndowment::new(Retention::Nothing)` is the intended shape: what is not listed is not
//! // granted, and what the spawner keeps is stated rather than inherited.
//! let endow = ChildEndowment {
//!     caps: &[(4, 0b11)], // our slot 4, read/write, landing in the child's slot 0
//!     fault: Some(7), // our slot 7 holds its supervision endpoint
//!     ..ChildEndowment::new(Retention::Nothing)
//! };
//!
//! assert_eq!(endow.caps.len(), 1);
//! assert!(endow.maps.is_empty() && endow.blobs.is_empty() && endow.placed.is_empty());
//! assert_eq!(endow.stack_pages, CHILD_STACK_PAGES);
//! assert_eq!(endow.retention, Retention::Nothing);
//!
//! // A construction sub-server, holding exactly the one program image it may build. That is what
//! // `blobs` buys: the child is handed *data* it has no capability to reach, so the sub-server
//! // never needs the whole initrd.
//! let image = &[0x7f, b'E', b'L', b'F'][..];
//! let builder = ChildEndowment {
//!     blobs: &[(0x2000_0000, image)],
//!     ..ChildEndowment::new(Retention::Nothing)
//! };
//! assert_eq!(builder.blobs[0].1.len(), 4);
//! assert!(builder.fault.is_none()); // unsupervised, and visibly so
//! ```
//!
//! The two budgets [`build_child`] takes are the design's load-bearing distinction and are easy to
//! pass in the wrong order, so it is worth stating what each one is for:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use supervision_proto::{ChildEndowment, Retention, build_child, start_child};
//! # fn demo(own: u64, per_child: u64, elf: &elf::Elf) -> Result<(), ()> {
//! let endow = ChildEndowment { fault: Some(7), ..ChildEndowment::new(Retention::Nothing) };
//!
//! // `own` pays for OUR scratch mappings; `per_child` is what the child is made of. Passing a
//! // per-child region as the second argument is what makes a single `DESTROY` reap the whole
//! // instance, and passing our own would free our page tables under the child.
//! let child = build_child(own, per_child, elf, &endow)?;
//! start_child(child, 0, 0, 0); // and the tcb capability goes back here, as declared
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Name: recorded (milestone 46, and notes/naming.md's crate section). The wire contract was
//! spelled four ways (`filesystem_proto`, `graphics_proto`, `netproto`, `line_editor::proto`) for one concept;
//! `*_proto` won on 2026-07-30 under DECISIONS §39, and `script/lint` has checked it since. That
//! rule plus the service the stem names produces this name, which is the whole of what `recorded`
//! claims: calef ruled on the rule, and never on this crate.
//! The stem is the tree's word for the restart discipline. The type it exports as `ChildEndowment` is an
//! open naming question of its own (DECISIONS §69): a verb where the tenet says noun, naming the
//! same idea as `grant_plan::Endowment` one construction step apart.
