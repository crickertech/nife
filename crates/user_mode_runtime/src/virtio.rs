//! **Thin safe wrappers over the four `Virtio` capability methods** (milestone 139 round 7).
//!
//! Four drivers (`gpu_driver.rs`, `entropy.rs`, `keyboard_driver.rs`, `net_transport.rs`) each called
//! `invoke(VIRTIO, abi::virtio::READ_REG/WRITE_REG/SETUP_QUEUE/NOTIFY, ...)` directly, eighteen
//! call sites in all, every one carrying the identical `// SAFETY:` comment: "the kernel validates
//! the capability and the method before acting." That comment is `invoke`'s own contract, not a
//! per-call obligation any of these four methods add: `abi::virtio`'s own doc already states what
//! the kernel checks (`WRITE_REG` refuses the queue-address and notify registers; `SETUP_QUEUE`
//! and `NOTIFY` are bounds-checked against the driver's DMA region and its own high-water mark),
//! so the raw `invoke` site could not add anything a wrapper cannot add just as well.
//!
//! Scoped to a module, not lifted into the crate root, because unlike [`super::send`] or
//! [`super::reply`] these four methods are meaningful to exactly the programs that own a `Virtio`
//! capability: the same "opt in by importing the module" shape [`super::heap`],
//! [`super::initrd`] and [`super::mapped_window`] already use for functionality most programs
//! never touch.

/// Name is **provisional** (a lane's, not ratified): it sits in this module beside the four

///
/// **Why one function rather than five.** This body was copied into `crates/virtio` and four
/// programs under `components/src/`, and every copy had an `aarch64` arm, a `riscv64` arm, and no
/// third arm, so on `x86_64-unknown-none` the whole function compiled to nothing: not the machine
/// barrier that `TSO` makes unnecessary, and not the compiler barrier that nothing makes
/// unnecessary. An empty function is not a warning, so `script/lint`'s `x86_64` user pass, written
/// to catch exactly this, could not. Five copies meant five places to be wrong and five places to
/// fix; the `compile_error!` below now exists once, and a sixth driver gets it by calling this
/// rather than by remembering. See notes/architecture-list-sweep.md, finding 9.
///
/// **What each architecture needs, and why they differ.** aarch64 and riscv64 are weakly ordered,
/// so both halves (machine and compiler) need a real instruction: `dmb ish` orders the inner
/// shareable domain, which is where a coherent DMA agent observes, and RISC-V takes one full
/// `fence`, the same conservative choice `kernel::arch::dma_wmb` makes. `x86_64` is TSO, and the
/// only orderings this function is ever asked for are store-store (descriptor before index, index
/// before notify) and load-load (used index before payload), both of which the machine already
/// guarantees for the write-back memory a coherent device shares. The store-load case TSO does
/// *not* give is not reachable here: every notify and every register access in these drivers
/// leaves the process through a syscall instruction, which is serializing. So on `x86_64` the
/// compiler is the entire exposure and [`core::sync::atomic::compiler_fence`] is the whole answer.
/// `components/src/non_volatile_memory_express.rs` keeps its own stronger barrier because its
/// doorbell is a direct store to a device-typed page in this address space rather than a syscall.
