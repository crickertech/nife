//! **The smallest whole program: `SEND` one word on slot 0, then exit**, hand-assembled per
//! architecture, for a parent that builds a child from EL0 through the granular verbs and needs
//! the child to run something.
//!
//! Moved here on 2026-09-19 from `fixtures/src/os_primitives_benchmarker.rs`, where it was private,
//! because milestone 168's `SPAWN` job needs the same child and a second hand-assembled copy of
//! three instruction sets is the drift AGENTS.md rule 7 exists to prevent. The bytes are unchanged;
//! only where they live moved. A parent copies [`SEND_THEN_EXIT`] into a frame it maps writable in
//! its own space, then aliases that frame as `MAP_CODE` into each child; the kernel makes the
//! I-cache coherent at that map.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 168's lane, 2026-09-19); the module and the constant are both
//! unratified. `child_stub` is what `os_primitives_benchmarker` already called it in prose.

/// The child's whole program, hand-assembled: `SEND(slot 0, rendezvous::SEND, 1)` then `SYS_EXIT`.
/// Its slot 0 is the `CHILD_DONE` endpoint the spawner inserts. Nine instructions: `SEND` the done
/// word (1) on the slot-0 endpoint, then `EXIT`. Every child runs this identical code, which is why
/// the spawner writes it into one shared frame and aliases that frame into each child. Hand-assembled
/// machine code, arch-gated: aarch64 `movz`/`svc`, RISC-V `li`/`ecall`.
///
/// aarch64: x0=slot 0, x1=SEND, x2=1, `x8=SYS_INVOKE`, svc; then `x8=SYS_EXIT`, svc.
