//! **The wall-clock contract** (milestone 51 lane A; DECISIONS §43, notes/clock.md).
//!
//! One definition of the three things the parties to wall-clock time have to agree on, so the
//! clock service, its readers, the std PAL and the kernel-side tests cannot drift: the layout of
//! the **shared clock page**, the small **propose protocol**, and the **policy** the service
//! applies to a proposal. The same split `filesystem_proto` makes for the filesystem and `graphics_proto` for
//! the framebuffer.
//!
//! # Three authorities, three different objects
//!
//! ```text
//!                              the RTC's registers (a DeviceFrame, one holder)
//!                                        │
//!                              ┌─────────▼────────┐
//!    propose ──an endpoint────►│  clock service   │
//!   (bounded, policy applies)  └─────────┬────────┘
//!                                        │ writes
//!                              ┌─────────▼────────┐
//!                              │  the clock page  │◄── set: the SAME page, mapped read/WRITE
//!                              └─────────┬────────┘
//!                                        │ mapped read-only
//!                                    readers
//! ```
//!
//! - **Read** is a **read-only mapping of the clock page** plus the ambient monotonic counter.
//!   No endpoint, no syscall, no server round trip: reading the time costs two loads and an add.
//!   A process with no such mapping does not know what time it is, and can say so.
//! - **Set** is a **read/write mapping of the same page**. Writing the offset *is* setting the
//!   clock; nothing polices it, which is what makes it the authority.
//! - **Propose** is an **endpoint** the service serves. A proposer holds no writable page, so the
//!   only thing it can do is ask, and [`policy::decide`] is what answers.
//!
//! The rights ladder is therefore the kernel's own: no capability, a `PageFrame` with `READ`, a
//! `PageFrame` with `WRITE`, an `Rendezvous` with `WRITE`. Nothing new in the syscall surface, and the
//! authority a process holds is visible to `caps`.
//!
//! # Wall clock is counter plus offset
//!
//! `Instant` stays the raw monotonic counter, ambient and untouched. Wall-clock time is
//! [`wall_nanos`]: the counter converted to nanoseconds, plus an **offset**, which is the only
//! thing anyone ever writes. So adjusting the wall clock cannot perturb monotonic time **by
//! construction rather than by discipline**: a step is an offset write, and the counter never
//! sees it.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Setting the wall clock is writing an offset, and the monotonic counter is not in the expression.
//! That is the section above stated as code, and it is the reason a clock step here cannot make
//! `Instant` go backwards the way a Unix `settimeofday` once could:
//!
//! ```
//! use clock_proto::{NANOS_PER_SEC, offset_for, wall_nanos};
//!
//! // The machine has been up for 5 seconds and the service has just learned the wall time.
//! let monotonic = 5 * NANOS_PER_SEC;
//! let now = 1_800_000_000 * NANOS_PER_SEC;
//! let offset = offset_for(now, monotonic);
//! assert_eq!(wall_nanos(offset, monotonic), now);
//!
//! // Two seconds later, with nobody having touched anything.
//! let monotonic = 7 * NANOS_PER_SEC;
//! assert_eq!(wall_nanos(offset, monotonic), now + 2 * NANOS_PER_SEC);
//!
//! // An operator steps the clock a minute forward. Only the offset changes.
//! let stepped = offset_for(now + 60 * NANOS_PER_SEC, monotonic);
//! assert_eq!(wall_nanos(stepped, monotonic), now + 60 * NANOS_PER_SEC);
//! assert_eq!(monotonic, 7 * NANOS_PER_SEC); // untouched, and there is no way to touch it
//! ```
//!
//! The other thing worth showing is **what a compromised network time client can and cannot do**,
//! because that is what makes the propose endpoint safe to hand out. It can lie inside
//! [`policy`]'s bounds and it can do nothing else, and the bounds are deliberately asymmetric:
//! forward skips instants nobody has observed, backward makes instants happen twice.
//!
//! ```
//! use clock_proto::{NANOS_PER_SEC, policy, state, status};
//!
//! let now = 1_800_000_000 * NANOS_PER_SEC;
//!
//! // A small correction, in either direction, is what a time client is for.
//! assert_eq!(policy::decide(state::SYNCED, now, now + NANOS_PER_SEC / 2), status::ACCEPTED);
//!
//! // Walking the clock past a certificate expiry in one step is the classic attack.
//! assert_eq!(
//!     policy::decide(state::SYNCED, now, now + 2 * policy::MAX_STEP_FORWARD_NANOS),
//!     status::REFUSED_TOO_FAR_FORWARD,
//! );
//!
//! // And the tighter half: a second forward is fine, a second and a half backward is not.
//! assert_eq!(policy::decide(state::SYNCED, now, now + 3 * NANOS_PER_SEC / 2), status::ACCEPTED);
//! assert_eq!(
//!     policy::decide(state::SYNCED, now, now - 3 * NANOS_PER_SEC / 2),
//!     status::REFUSED_TOO_FAR_BACKWARD,
//! );
//!
//! // The bootstrap case: a machine that does not know the time has no belief for a step limit to
//! // protect, so a plausible proposal is accepted outright. The sanity window still applies.
//! assert_eq!(policy::decide(state::UNKNOWN, 0, now), status::ACCEPTED);
//! assert_eq!(policy::decide(state::UNKNOWN, 0, 0), status::REFUSED_IMPLAUSIBLE);
//! assert!(!policy::plausible(0)); // 1970 plus uptime is not a time this code can be running at
//! ```
//!
//! # Everything is nanoseconds since the Unix epoch, in a `u64`
//!
//! One unit everywhere, so no conversion sits at a boundary where it can be forgotten. A `u64` of
//! nanoseconds runs out in the year 2554, which is recorded rather than defended: it is past every
//! horizon this project has, and picking `u64` keeps the wire words, the page words and the
//! arithmetic identical.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review, confirming
//! milestone 46's own reasoning). The wire contract was spelled four ways (`filesystem_proto`,
//! `graphics_proto`, `netproto`, `line_editor::proto`) for one concept; `*_proto` won on
//! 2026-07-30 under DECISIONS §39, and `script/lint` has checked it since.
//! The stem is the service's own word (`clock`, DECISIONS §43), which is itself unrecorded.

/// **The memory ordering is the point, not decoration** (the project's rule 4: assume weak

/// offset from another. A wrong wall clock, silently. It is not reachable on x86, QEMU's TCG
/// explores almost none of the orderings that produce it, and every host test and every emulated
/// boot passed throughout. The fix is a `fence(Release)` in [`publish`](Self::publish), commented
/// where it sits. See notes/interleaving.md.
///
/// Writers are **multiple** (the service, and whoever holds the page read/write), so claiming the
/// sequence is a compare-exchange rather than a plain store. Two writers racing is not a design we
/// encourage, but it is a design the capability layout permits, and a seqlock that assumed a single
/// writer would corrupt silently rather than serialise.
///
/// # BUGS
///
/// - **The orderings are checked against C11, not against ARM's model or RISC-V's.**
///   `script/interleaving-check` runs loom, which searches the C11 model: a tear it finds is real,
///   and a clean run is not a proof about either ISA. Litmus-level confidence would need herd7-style
///   tooling, and nothing in this tree yet reads this page from two physical cores under load.
/// - **A reader spins while a writer holds the sequence, and the spin has no bound.** A writer that
///   faults between its claim and its release leaves the page permanently odd and every reader
///   spinning in [`read`](Self::read). The window is four stores wide and the writer holds no lock,
