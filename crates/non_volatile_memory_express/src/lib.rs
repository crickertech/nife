#![no_std]
//! **NVMe queue mechanics, as pure logic** (milestone 53's storage half; notes/non-volatile-memory-express.md).
//!
//! Everything an NVMe driver computes, with nothing an NVMe driver touches. The controller's
//! register file, the doorbells, and the DMA memory the queues live in are all the kernel's
//! (`kernel/src/non_volatile_memory_express.rs`, which is a thin volatile layer over this crate); what lives here is the
//! arithmetic those accesses carry: which doorbell, what dword, whose completion. That split is
//! rule 7's, the same one `pci` and `virtio` already follow, and it is what makes the queue logic
//! host-testable and Kani-reachable when the device itself only exists inside an emulator.
//!
//! The shape of the protocol, in one paragraph (NVMe 1.4, chapters 4 and 5): the driver builds
//! 64-byte **commands** in a **submission queue** (a ring in driver-owned DMA memory), then writes
//! the ring's new tail to that queue's **doorbell register**; the controller reads the commands,
//! does the work, and writes 16-byte **completions** into the paired **completion queue**, each
//! carrying a **phase tag** that flips every time the controller laps the ring, which is how the
//! driver tells a fresh completion from a stale one without any shared index; the driver then
//! writes the completion queue's new head to its own doorbell. Queue pair 0 is the **admin**
//! queue, created by registers at reset; every other pair is created by admin commands. Data moves
//! through **PRPs**, physical page pointers carried inside the command.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The phase tag is the mechanism worth demonstrating, because it is how a driver tells a fresh
//! completion from a stale one **with no shared index and no memory the controller and driver both
//! write**. A ring that starts zeroed reads as phase 0, the first lap writes 1s, and every lap
//! flips:
//!
//! ```
//! use non_volatile_memory_express::{Completion, CqState};
//!
//! let mut cq = CqState::new(2); // a two-slot ring, so it laps quickly
//!
//! // The initial zeros. Phase 0 against an expected phase of 1: not ours, do not read the result.
//! let stale = Completion::from_dwords([0, 0, 0, 0]);
//! assert!(!cq.is_owned(&stale));
//!
//! // The controller's first completion, phase bit set, for command id 7.
//! let fresh = Completion::from_dwords([0, 0, 0, 7 | (1 << 16)]);
//! assert!(cq.is_owned(&fresh));
//! assert_eq!(fresh.cid, 7);
//! assert_eq!(fresh.status, 0); // 0 is success
//! assert_eq!(cq.pop(), 1); // the value the driver writes to the completion head doorbell
//!
//! // Slot 1, same lap, still phase 1.
//! assert!(cq.is_owned(&fresh));
//! assert_eq!(cq.pop(), 0); // wrapped, so the expected phase flipped
//!
//! // Now the ring has lapped, and last lap's entries are the stale ones. This is the whole trick:
//! // the bytes in slot 0 have not changed, and their meaning has.
//! assert!(!cq.is_owned(&fresh));
//! assert!(cq.is_owned(&stale));
//! ```
//!
//! Doorbells are pure arithmetic over a stride the controller reports, and getting the parity wrong
//! means ringing a completion head where a submission tail belongs:
//!
//! ```
//! use non_volatile_memory_express::{Cap, Doorbell, doorbell};
//!
//! // A controller reporting DSTRD 0, so doorbells are 4 bytes apart.
//! let cap = Cap(0);
//! assert_eq!(cap.doorbell_stride(), 0);
//!
//! // Admin queue (qid 0), then the one I/O queue pair this driver creates.
//! assert_eq!(doorbell(0, Doorbell::SubmissionTail, 0), 0x1000);
//! assert_eq!(doorbell(0, Doorbell::CompletionHead, 0), 0x1004);
//! assert_eq!(doorbell(1, Doorbell::SubmissionTail, 0), 0x1008);
//! assert_eq!(doorbell(1, Doorbell::CompletionHead, 0), 0x100c);
//! ```
//!
//! And [`prp_pair`] answers `None` rather than guessing, which is the interesting half: a transfer
//! that would need a PRP *list* is a bug in this driver rather than a device error, because its unit
//! of transfer is one 4096-byte filesystem block.
//!
//! ```
//! use non_volatile_memory_express::prp_pair;
//!
//! // A page-aligned block: one pointer is enough.
//! assert_eq!(prp_pair(0x4000_0000, 4096, 4096), Some((0x4000_0000, 0)));
//!
//! // The same block, offset half a page: it spills, so PRP2 carries the next page boundary, with
//! // no offset of its own. That "offset-free by construction" is the spec's rule for PRP2.
//! assert_eq!(prp_pair(0x4000_0800, 4096, 4096), Some((0x4000_0800, 0x4000_1000)));
//!
//! // Three pages would need a list. Not expressible, and said so.
//! assert_eq!(prp_pair(0x4000_0000, 3 * 4096, 4096), None);
//! ```
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-17 (calef, DECISIONS §154), **deratifying this crate's own 2026-08-23
//! ratification** to do it, and performed on 2026-09-18. Refused `nvme`, `nvm_express`,
//! `nvme_driver` and `nvme_server`; the argument for each is below.
//!
//! **What it overturns is its own earlier ratification** (2026-08-23, a kernel-dependency crate
//! naming review), which read: *"the specification's own name for the device family, the same
//! claim `pci` and `virtio` make."* That exemption was never the acronym test AGENTS.md states,
//! and the acronym test is what this name fails. An acronym is spelled out **unless its expansion
//! teaches nothing**: "peripheral component interconnect" leaves a reader no wiser and `pci`
//! stays, where "non-volatile memory" tells a reader this crate is about **storage**, which `nvme`
//! says to nobody who has not already met the word. `virtio` is not an acronym at all, so it was
//! never evidence for this one.
//!
//! **The deciding precedent is in this tree**: `network_time_protocol`, `filesystem_protocol`
//! (was `fs_proto`), `graphics_protocol` (was `gfx_proto`) and `credential_protocol` (was
//! `cred_proto`). NTP is at least as famous an acronym as NVMe and this tree spells it out.
//!
//! **This is the name milestone 265 said would come**, and a reader meeting it beside `pci` and
//! `gpt` is owed why those two did not move. 265 narrowed the external-standard exemption to a
//! boundary on 2026-09-13: *a standard's own name stays whole where it names a format or a piece
//! of hardware (`elf`, `pci`, `dtb`, `gpt`), and expands where it names a network protocol*, and
//! it closed by saying nothing mechanical can tell the two apart, so the next name that tests the
//! line comes to calef. This is that name.
//!
//! **It lands on the protocol side without the line moving.** NVM Express is not a piece of
//! hardware and not a format; its own specifications define how host software *communicates* with
//! non-volatile memory across several transports, PCIe among them but also RDMA and TCP, and NVMe
//! over TCP has its own RFC. `pci` names the bus the messages travel on and `gpt` names a layout
//! written to a disk, which is why both stay whole while this expands. **That reconciliation is
//! the maintainer's reading of calef's boundary rather than calef's own words**; if the intent was
//! to move the line instead, this paragraph is what needs correcting.
//!
//! **The line did move, the next day, and the paragraph above is kept as the account it now is.**
//! DECISIONS §154 (2026-09-18) replaced 265's format-versus-protocol boundary with one question,
//! whether the expansion is a phrase people say. Under it `gpt` expanded after all, to
//! `globally_unique_identifier_partition_table`, and `pci` stays for a different reason than the
//! one given above: not because it names a bus, but because nobody says "peripheral component
//! interconnect". This crate's own name is unchanged by the switch, since "non-volatile memory" is
//! spoken under either test.
//!
//! **Refused `nvm_express`**, which the maintainer recommended and argued was the faithful
//! spelling, since "NVM Express" is what the standard and its consortium actually call themselves
//! and `non_volatile_memory_express` expands an acronym nested inside that name. calef's ruling is
//! that the rule is about the reader rather than about the vendor, and `NVM` is four letters a
//! newcomer bounces off whether or not the specification chose to keep them. **Refused `nvme`**,
//! above. **Refused `nvme_driver` and `nvme_server`** for the program, both of which carry the
//! same unexpanded word.
//!
//! **`script/names --check` reports this name as "refused but live", and that is a parse artifact
//! rather than a fact.** The refusal clause above runs to the end of its sentence, and that
//! sentence names `non_volatile_memory_express` while arguing against `nvm_express`, so the
//! parser records the winner as a refusal too. It is a NOTE and never a failure, the same shape
//! `video_terminal` carries for a real reason. It was left alone on 2026-09-18 because rewording
//! the sentence would move the tree-wide refusal count, which is the one gate a performed rename
//! is measured by; the count held at 273 across this rename.
//!
//! **Known cost, recorded rather than hidden**: every datasheet, every error message and this
//! kernel's own boot output say `nvme`, so a reader grepping the word the machine printed will not
//! find these identifiers. That is the price of the rule and it was weighed.
//!
//! Introduced 2026-08-15 with milestone 53's NVMe block driver. The kernel's module is this
//! crate's volatile half, the crate/module name-sharing convention AGENTS.md records for
//! `compositor`.
//!
//! **What did not move, and it was most of the word.** Three of the four senses of it are not
//! identifiers: a citation of the standard (`NVMe 1.4 §3.1`) is the spec's own name; a bench
//! transcript is evidence and is never edited; and a `BUILT` roadmap block is an account of what
//! was built under the name it had. Measured across the performed rename on 2026-09-18: **615
//! occurrences in 93 files before, 477 in 87 files after**, so 138 moved and 477 stayed. Of what
//! stayed, 241 are the standard as a proper noun in prose, 71 are QEMU's device name or a build
//! artifact, 68 are the old name inside an account or a quotation, 30 are spec citations, 26 are
//! a decision or roadmap slug, and 26 are `crates/pci`'s class-code identifiers.
//! AGENTS.md's own scar is the blind `sed` that rewrote the row recording a name's *refusal*.
//!
//! **Four things carried the name and all four moved**: this crate, `kernel/src/nvme.rs`, the
//! `Nvme` type inside it, and the program, which took this crate's own name rather than a
//! `_server` suffix (calef, 2026-09-18; the argument is in
//! `components/src/non_volatile_memory_express.rs`). `kernel/src/user/nvme_service.rs` and
//! `nvme_tests.rs` went with the program, because a `<program>_service` module's name is the
//! program's name plus a suffix and carries no decision of its own.
//!
//! **What stayed in the neighbouring crates was deliberate.** `crates/pci`'s `CLASS_NVME`,
//! `PciNvmeDevice` and `find_nvme_device` name the **PCI class code the specification defines**,
//! not this crate, so they keep the spelling for the same reason `satp.ASID` and `flush_asid`
//! kept theirs through §154's first rename. So do QEMU's `-device nvme`, the `NIFE_NVME`
//! environment variable and `target/nife-nvme.img`: an emulator's device name and a build
//! artifact are not names this tree gets to choose. `clippy.toml` keeps its `NVMe` entry for the
//! same reason the citations do, which is that the proper noun survives the rename intact.
//!
//! **It was ruled on 2026-09-17 and performed on 2026-09-18**, a day apart on purpose: milestone
//! 320 was a live lane in `kernel/src/pci.rs` and `crates/pci`, rewriting `find_nvme_device` and
//! the bus walk around it, and landing a tree-wide rename underneath it would have handed that
//! lane a conflict in the files it was rewriting. Sequencing the two was cheaper than merging
//! them (AGENTS.md on the collision surface).
