//! **`package_archive`**: the one file a nife package is, read and written by one definition.
//!
//! DECISIONS §197 (a package is one archive file), in
//! [its own file](../../../design/decisions/197-a-package-is-one-archive-file.md), ruled the container: **one archive file per package**, identified by name and
//! version, in the shape `.deb`, `.apk` and `.hpkg` all use, with
//! DECISIONS §195 (a reviewed recipe vouches for a package), in
//! [its own file](../../../design/decisions/195-a-recipe-vouches-and-the-owner-may-overrule.md),'s reviewed recipe carrying the digest that decides
//! whether the bytes may run. This crate is that container's bytes: a host tool writes one with
//! [`write_package`] and a target reads it with [`Package::parse`], so **one definition of the
//! format serves both**, which is the same arrangement `crates/nifefs` has and for the same reason.
//!
//! Pure logic, host-tested, `no_std`, no allocation. A reader borrows out of the buffer it is given
//! and builds nothing, because the first consumer of this format is a program on a system whose
//! loader has no allocator.
//!
//! **This is rung 3a's producer half and the parser it implies.** It deliberately does *not*
//! install anything: what installing a package *does* to a running system is the activation fork
//! (milestone 507 (installing a package: mutate, compose, or widen what can be spawned),
//! options with no winner), which is calef's and is not decided. A package that
//! can be built, named, verified and read is what that ruling will act on, and it is buildable
//! without it.
//!
//! # The layout
//!
//! ```text
//!   header, HEADER_LEN = 112 bytes
//!     magic          "NIFEPKG1"   8 bytes, version in the last byte
//!     name           NAME_LEN = 32 bytes, NUL-padded
//!     version        NAME_LEN = 32 bytes, NUL-padded
//!     architecture   NAME_LEN = 32 bytes, NUL-padded
//!     member_count   u32 LE
//!     reserved       u32 LE, zero, so the table starts 8-byte aligned
//!
//!   the table of contents, member_count entries of MEMBER_LEN = 72 bytes:
//!     name           NAME_LEN = 32 bytes, NUL-padded
//!     offset         u32 LE, absolute, from the start of the file
//!     len            u32 LE
//!     digest         DIGEST_LEN = 32 bytes, SHA-256 of that member's bytes
//!
//!   member bytes, each starting at an 8-byte boundary
//! ```
//!
//! **Three choices in that table are worth their reasons.**
//!
//! `offset` is absolute rather than relative to the member area, so a reader never has to know
//! where the table ends to find data; only the writer computes that. `crates/nifefs` made the same
//! call about `start_block` and says so.
//!
//! Each member carries **its own digest**, where `.hpkg` carries none and keeps SHA-256 in the
//! repository index. §195 puts a digest over the whole file in the recipe, which answers "are these
//! the reviewed bytes"; a per-member digest answers "is *this* member the one that was reviewed",
//! which is the question a spawner asks when it is handed one program out of a package. The
//! measurement table the progenitor already enforces (`crates/measured_boot`) is exactly a
//! name-to-digest map, so a package's table of contents is that table travelling with its bytes.
//!
//! Member bytes are **8-byte aligned** because the largest member is an ELF and the cheapest way to
//! be wrong later is to hand a parser an odd address. It costs at most seven bytes per member.
//!
//! # Names, and the ceiling on them
//!
//! A name is at most [`NAME_LEN`] bytes and is **not** NUL-terminated when it uses all of them, so
//! a reader compares against `NAME_LEN` bytes and stops at the first NUL if there is one. That is
//! `nifefs`'s rule, kept deliberately: `NAME_LEN` there is the ceiling on every spawnable name in
//! this system, so a package member that cannot be an archive entry would be a member nothing could
//! install.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! Write a package, read it back, and check a member against its digest:
//!
//! ```
//! # use package_archive::{Attributes, Package, package_size, write_package};
//! let members: [(&str, &[u8]); 2] = [("uptime", b"\x7fELF..."), ("uptime.licence", b"MIT")];
//! let attributes = Attributes { name: "uptime", version: "0.1.0", architecture: "aarch64" };
//!
//! let mut file = vec![0u8; package_size(&members)];
//! write_package(&attributes, &members, &mut file).unwrap();
//!
//! let package = Package::parse(&file).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(package.name(), "uptime");
//! assert_eq!(package.version(), "0.1.0");
//! assert_eq!(package.read("uptime"), Some(&b"\x7fELF..."[..]));
//! package.verify().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Refuse a file that has been edited since it was written:
//!
//! ```
//! # use package_archive::{Attributes, Package, VerifyError, package_size, write_package};
//! # let members: [(&str, &[u8]); 1] = [("uptime", b"\x7fELF...")];
//! # let attributes = Attributes { name: "uptime", version: "0.1.0", architecture: "aarch64" };
//! # let mut file = vec![0u8; package_size(&members)];
//! # write_package(&attributes, &members, &mut file).unwrap();
//! let last = file.len() - 1;
//! file[last] ^= 0xff;
//! assert_eq!(Package::parse(&file).unwrap().verify(), Err(VerifyError { index: 0 }));
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Nothing installs a package.** This crate produces and reads one; the activation fork
//!   (milestone 507) decides what installing means, and until it is ruled a package is a file with
//!   no consumer on the target. That is the honest state of rung 3a, not an oversight.
//! - **The encoding is provisional**, and so is the crate's name. §197 ruled the *container*, not
//!   these offsets. Two of its own open questions are deliberately not answered here: where a
//!   program's manifest travels (a sibling member is merely *possible* under this layout, because
//!   a member is any named bytes; nothing in this crate requires or names one) and whether the
//!   digest is a Merkle root (this takes the plain SHA-256 §197 records as the default). Nobody
//!   outside this repository has a nife package, so the encoding is still free to move; §197 says
//!   the day one is fetched by somebody else is the day it is fixed.
//! - **No compression.** `.hpkg` chunks its heap with zlib and `.apk` is three gzip streams; this
//!   stores members whole. The first packages are ELFs that were about to be written to a disk
//!   anyway, and a compressor is a second hostile-input parser on the same path. It is a size cost,
//!   measured nowhere yet.
//! - **`a_short_file_is_refused` carries `#[kani::unwind(9)]`, and proves nothing less for it.**
//!   Unbounded, its falsification took **20 to 31 minutes** at **3.0-3.6 GB** of solver memory
//!   (patagonia, other lanes running, so an order of magnitude). The cause is the harness's shape
//!   and it is `nifefs`'s exactly: once the weakened guard admits the one concrete length, symbolic
//!   execution reaches the member loop, bounded by a `count` read from symbolic bytes, and CBMC has
//!   to unroll it. `nifefs`'s did not finish at all. On the correct tree the guard returns first and
//!   no loop is reachable, so the bound adds no unwinding assertion and cuts no path. Measured
//!   2026-09-24, three runs each, Kani 0.67.0: **before**, SUCCESSFUL, 0 of 343 checks failed (25
//!   unreachable), 0.19 to 0.22 s; **after**, the same 0 of 343 (25 unreachable), 0.18 to 0.23 s.
//!   The falsification now goes red in **1.3 s**, on the harness's own `assert_eq!` and nothing
//!   else. 9 is the least bound that lets the 8-byte magic compare finish, the reason `nifefs`
//!   chose it.
//! - **A package is bounded by `u32`.** A member longer than 4 GiB, or a file longer than 4 GiB,
//!   cannot be represented. The largest member anyone has packed is `rg` at 10.7 MB.
//! - **A duplicate member name is refused by the writer and first-wins in the reader**, which is
//!   `nifefs`'s split exactly. A reader cannot refuse it cheaply without comparing every pair, and
//!   the producer is the place that knows.
//! - **[`Package::parse`] does not check that members do not overlap**, nor that they lie after the
//!   table. Every accessor is bounds-checked against the buffer, so an overlapping file is readable
//!   rather than unsafe, and [`Package::verify`] is what makes an unreviewed arrangement of bytes
//!   fail: a member that overlaps another cannot match both digests unless the bytes really are
//!   shared.
//! - **Nothing here says where a package came from.** §195's per-source trust is the client's
//!   business, and there is no client yet.
//!
//! Name: provisional 2026-09-23 (milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install)'s
//! rung 3a lane). `package_archive` because the
//! thing is an archive of a package's files and both words are the ones the field uses; a bare
//! `package` would be the generic-word failure `design/naming.md` names, and `pkg` the abbreviation
//! one. Not ratified by calef.
