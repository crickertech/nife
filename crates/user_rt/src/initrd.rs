//! **The initrd archive slice every program receives at spawn** (milestone 139).
//!
//! Seven programs (`builder`, `c_confiner`, `hello`, `login`, `root_supervisor`, `swapper`,
//! `timetable`) each declared their own `const INITRD_VA: u64 = 0x2000_0000` and their own
//! `unsafe { core::slice::from_raw_parts(INITRD_VA as *const u8, initrd_len as usize) }`, one
//! hand-written `// SAFETY:` comment per file asserting the identical invariant: the kernel maps
//! `initrd_len` bytes of the initrd archive, read-only, at a fixed VA, before `_start` runs.
//! `timetable.rs`'s own comment had already named the duplication out loud ("the same contract
//! `user/src/builder.rs` is started under") without anyone lifting it out, the same shape
//! `ntp.rs`'s comment named for the [`mapped_window`](crate::mapped_window) cluster.
//!
//! [`initrd_bytes`] holds that one assertion instead of seven. This does not remove the `unsafe`
//! block at each call site the way `MappedWindow` did: this hands back a whole `'static` slice
//! rather than a bounds-checked per-offset accessor, and `initrd_len` cannot be validated by any
//! type (any `u64` compiles), so the obligation stays a sentence rather than becoming a checked
//! `assert!`. But it is still a real reduction by this milestone's own criterion 1: collapsing
//! seven hand-written copies of one invariant into one declaration, the §94 shape
//! (`design/decisions/94-what-may-live-in-a-library.md`: "a per-binary item whose body is copied
//! verbatim into every binary is not per-binary; only its declaration is"), the same "flat block
//! count, still a real reduction" case `smb_server.rs`, `swish.rs`'s terminal pair and
//! `display_terminal.rs`'s `paint` already were in this milestone's earlier rounds.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Bare-metal only, like the rest of this crate (see the crate-level doc for why this is `no_run`).
//!
//! ```no_run
//! #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
//! pub extern "C" fn _start(_a0: u64, initrd_len: u64, _a2: u64) -> ! {
//!     // SAFETY: the kernel maps `initrd_len` bytes of the initrd archive, read-only, at
//!     // INITRD_VA, before this process's `_start` runs (user_rt::initrd's own contract).
//!     let archive = unsafe { user_rt::initrd::initrd_bytes(initrd_len) };
//!     let _ = archive;
//!     loop {}
//! }
//! ```

/// aarch64) maps this many bytes at, read-only, before starting the process. Every `_start` that

/// compiles, the same "the parameter could have been produced without meeting this" case
/// `notes/unsafe-obligations.md` (milestone 112) already names for `switch_user_root`.
