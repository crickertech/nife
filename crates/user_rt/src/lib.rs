//! **`user_rt`**: the tiny EL0 runtime shared by nife userspace programs (milestone 19f.6).
//!
//! One syscall wrapper (`invoke`) and the three things every program builds on it: `send`, `recv`,
//! and `exit`. That is the whole crate. It exists because milestones 19f.2-5 split the userspace
//! into distinct binaries (`worker`, `console`, `input`, `shell`, plus `hello`), each of which had
//! copied these functions verbatim. The extraction waited on purpose until the split was done: only
//! then was the shared surface known rather than guessed, which is the DECISIONS rule about not
//! building an abstraction before its requirements exist.
//!
//! Milestone 27 added one more thing every program *may* build on: [`heap`], the untyped-backed
//! `GlobalAlloc` that turns the budget a program was granted into `Vec` and `String`. It is a
//! module, not a default: a program that never allocates links no allocator.
//!
//! Milestone 139 added a third: [`mapped_window`], the raw volatile-access-into-a-mapped-page
//! seven drivers had each hand-rolled (a DMA page or a shared IPC frame, read and written by
//! `unsafe { core::ptr::read_volatile/write_volatile }` at every call site). Same shape as the
//! panic handler above: the invariant was one thing asserted N times by hand, and only the
//! declaration needed to be per-caller.
//!
//! And a fourth, in the same round: [`initrd`], the `INITRD_VA` slice seven `init`-shaped programs
//! each reconstructed by hand with `core::slice::from_raw_parts`. A different pattern from
//! `mapped_window` (a whole `'static` slice, not a bounds-checked per-offset accessor), but the
//! same §94 shape underneath: one invariant, copied verbatim into seven declarations.
//!
//! Round 7 read every remaining raw `invoke(...)` call site in `user/` (123 of them, the milestone's
//! own largest unmigrated cluster) and found the same shape at nearly all of them: a method whose
//! own `# Safety` obligation is [`invoke`]'s own ("the kernel validates the capability and the
//! method before acting"), asserted by hand at every call site with nothing call-site-specific to
//! check. Fourteen new thin wrappers below (`retype_page_frame` through `send_cap`), plus
//! [`granted`] (the §94 shape again, five programs' identical probe) and the opt-in [`virtio`]
//! module (device-specific, so scoped like `mapped_window` rather than added here), cover all but
//! one of them; see that one call site's own comment (`window.rs`'s refusal probe) for why it stays
//! raw.
//!
//! The `#[panic_handler]` is **still not an item here, and now the trap underneath it is**
//! (milestone 130). A panic handler is per-final-binary: exactly one may exist in a linked program,
//! so an item in this library would force it on every program that links the crate and collide with
//! any program that wants its own (as `hello` does). That has been recorded since 19f.6 and it is
//! still true. What went stale beside it was the sentence "each binary keeps its own one-line
//! handler; it is trivial": the handler grew to fifteen lines with two `unsafe` blocks and two
//! `// SAFETY:` comments, and by the time anyone counted, the trap instruction was inlined at
//! **forty-eight sites** in seven variants, one of which called [`exit`] instead of trapping and so
//! reported a clean death for a panicking program. The constraint was right and the inference from
//! it was not: a *handler* cannot live in a library, but the *trap* always could.
//!
//! So [`trap`] is here, and [`panic_handler!`] is a macro that expands to the handler in the
//! binary. The linking property survives, and the claim below about this being the one place in
//! userspace that names the two ABIs becomes true rather than aspirational. Device helpers (a UART
//! `putc`, echo logic) still stay in the drivers that own them: those are not runtime, they are the
//! program.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! **This crate is the one place in the tree where an example genuinely cannot run**, and the reason
//! is worth stating rather than hiding behind a fence marker. Every function here traps to the kernel
//! from EL0: `svc`/`ecall` on a machine with no nife kernel under it is a fault, not a syscall, and
//! `script/test`'s host pass excludes this crate and everything that depends on it (the exclusion set
//! is derived and checked by `script/lint`). So the examples below are `no_run`: they are type-checked
//! against the real signatures on an aarch64 host and are **not executed anywhere**. The things that
//! *can* be checked are the wire contracts layered over them, which is where those crates put their
//! examples (`byte_sink_proto`, `filesystem_proto`, `entropy_proto`).
//!
//! A program's whole life, in the four calls that make up this crate. Note what is absent: there is
//! no `open`, no path, and no way to name anything that was not handed over.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use user_rt::{exit, recv, send};
//!
//! /// A pipeline stage: read three words off the endpoint in slot 0, pass them to slot 1.
//! fn relay() -> ! {
//!     const IN: u64 = 0;
//!     const OUT: u64 = 1;
//!     loop {
//!         // `recv` blocks until a sender rendezvouses. The rendezvous IS the flow control: there
//!         // is no buffer to fill and no back-pressure to invent.
//!         let (w0, w1, w2) = recv(IN);
//!         if send(OUT, w0, w1, w2) < 0 {
//!             // A negative return is an `abi::Error`. `Gone` here means the reader exited, which
//!             // is this system's SIGPIPE, arriving as a return code rather than as a signal.
//!             exit();
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A client of a service uses [`call`], which blocks until the reply lands. The reply arrives through
//! a one-shot capability the kernel mints, so the client never names the server and the server never
//! names the client:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use user_rt::call;
//!
//! # fn ask() {
//! const SERVICE: u64 = 2;
//! let (r0, r1) = call(SERVICE, 0x0100_0000_0000_0008, 0);
//!
//! // Negative-as-u64 is enormous, which is how a wire contract tells "no capability in that slot"
//! // from an answer without a probe request. See `entropy_proto::delivered`.
//! assert!((r0 as i64) >= 0 || abi::Error::from_ret(r0 as i64).is_some());
//! # let _ = r1;
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Three ABIs, one surface
//!
//! The syscall instruction and the register file differ by architecture, and this is the one place
//! in userspace that names them. aarch64 uses `svc #0` with the syscall number in `x8` and arguments
//! in `x0..x5`; RISC-V uses `ecall` with the number in `a7` and arguments in `a0..a5`; `x86_64` uses
//! `syscall` with the number in `rax` and arguments in `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `r10`, `r8`, `r9`
//! ([DECISIONS §124](../../../design/decisions/124-x86-64-syscall-abi.md), ratified 2026-08-24).
//! All three return in the first argument register (`x0` / `a0` / `rdi`). The kernel reconciles them
//! in `TrapFrame` (DECISIONS §17); here we simply select the right asm at compile time. Every
//! function's signature, semantics, and the `abi` constants are identical across all three.
//!
//! **`x86_64` is the arm that costs more than a transliteration**, and there are exactly three places
//! it does. `syscall` clobbers `rcx` and `r11` unconditionally, so every site declares them; `rdtsc`
//! answers in two halves rather than one register (see [`now`]); and there is **no architected
//! counter frequency at all**, which is why [`cntfrq`] carries a `BUGS` section rather than a number
//! with a comment. Everything else is the same three instructions in a different spelling.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded, and half-argued in the way that keeps it that way. Milestone 63 treats
//! `user_` as settled precedent while renaming `uheap`: "the `u` was *userspace*, and `user_rt`
//! already establishes `user_` as the prefix for it." So the prefix is on the record because this
//! crate established it, which is a circle rather than a reason. The `rt` half is an
//! **abbreviation**, the first of the naming tenet's three failure modes, and nothing weighs it
//! against `runtime`. Introduced 2026-07-25 when the shared EL0 runtime was lifted out; the
//! decision here is worth more than one name, because half a convention rests on it.

    // here: a *software* interrupt is refused unless the IDT gate's DPL admits the caller's
    // privilege level, and this kernel's gates are all DPL 0, so `int3` from a process raises
    // **#GP with error code 0x1a** (`(3 << 3) | 2`, the vector it was refused, tagged as an IDT
    // selector) instead of #BP. The process does die, so the first version of this looked like it

    // the instruction nor the reason and would have sent the next reader hunting a segmentation
    // bug.

/// **The panic handler every nife program wants**, as a macro so it stays per-final-binary.
///
/// Write `user_rt::panic_handler!();` once at the top level of a binary and it expands to a
/// `#[panic_handler]` that calls [`trap`].
///
/// # Why a macro and not a plain item in this crate
///
/// A `#[panic_handler]` is per-final-binary: exactly one may exist in a linked program, so a
/// library that defines one forces it on every binary that links the library and collides with any
/// binary wanting its own. That constraint is real and this crate's header has recorded it since
/// milestone 19f.6. A macro keeps it: nothing is defined until a binary asks, and a program with
/// its own handler simply does not invoke this.
///
/// What the header got wrong, and what milestone 130 is fixing, is the clause after it: "each
/// binary keeps its own one-line handler; it is trivial." It stopped being one line. By the time
/// anyone counted it was fifteen, with two `unsafe` blocks and two `// SAFETY:` comments, at
/// forty-eight sites across `user/`, `crates/` and `redoxfs_server/`, in **seven** variants. One of
/// them (`terminal_sink_caretaker`) called `exit` instead of trapping, which reports a clean death
/// for a panicking program; it was latent only because that program happens to be spawned
/// unsupervised.
///
/// So the decision not to put a *handler* in a library was right, and the inference that each
/// binary must therefore hand-roll the *trap* did not follow. The trap belongs here, in the crate
/// whose header calls itself the one place in userspace that names the two ABIs, and the macro is
/// what lets that be true without breaking the linking property.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// #![no_std]
/// #![no_main]
///
/// user_rt::panic_handler!();
///
/// #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
/// pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
///     user_rt::exit()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # BUGS
///
/// It takes no arguments and ignores the `PanicInfo`, because a program with no console cannot
/// print one. A program that *can* print (it holds a terminal endpoint) and wants the message on
/// the way down still writes its own handler; this macro is the default, not a mandate.
///
/// Named for the item it expands to, which is the one thing a reader needs it to say.
