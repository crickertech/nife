//! **The untyped-backed heap: `alloc` for userspace, paid from the process's own budget**
//! (milestone 27).
//!
//! A [`GlobalAlloc`] that grows by mapping pages out of the untyped capability the process was
//! granted, via `untyped::MAP` (one page per invoke, zeroed by the kernel, writable). The
//! algorithm itself lives in `crates/user_heap` and is host-tested; this module is the policy and the
//! syscall glue: a spinlock, a committed-range cursor, and grow-on-demand.
//!
//! # The contract a program signs
//!
//! Declaring the allocator is two lines and one call, all in the program's own source, because
//! the heap's inputs are part of that program's capability contract (notes/abi.md §4):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static HEAP: user_rt::heap::UntypedHeap = user_rt::heap::UntypedHeap::new();
//! // first thing in _start:
//! HEAP.init(UNTYPED_SLOT, user_rt::heap::DEFAULT_BASE, 4 * 1024 * 1024);
//! ```
//!
//! - **Which untyped slot** feeds the heap is the program's convention with its parent, like
//!   every other slot. There is no ambient memory to fall back on: no untyped granted, no heap.
//! - **Where the heap lives** is a virtual range the program promises not to use for anything
//!   else. [`DEFAULT_BASE`] (1 GiB) clears every VA convention in the tree today (program text at
//!   `0x40_0000`, stacks, the shared pages, init's scratch at `0x1000_0000`, the initrd at
//!   `0x2000_0000`).
//! - **`max_bytes`** caps growth so a leak exhausts the heap, visibly, before it silently eats
//!   the budget the program also builds children from. The untyped itself is the hard ceiling
//!   either way: `MAP` returns `OutOfMemory` when the region is spent, and the allocator reports
//!   that as an allocation failure (which `alloc`'s default OOM handler turns into a panic).
//!
//! Allocating before `init` fails cleanly (null, then the OOM panic): there is nothing to grow
//! from until the program says which capability pays.
//!
//! # Why a spinlock is enough
//!
//! `GlobalAlloc` must be `Sync`. Today a process is one thread (std's `thread::spawn` is
//! `Unsupported` in milestone 27 phase one), so the lock is never contended; when threads within
//! one process arrive, a spinlock stays correct under this kernel's preemptive scheduler because
//! the holder always gets scheduled again to release it. What it is *not* is efficient under real
//! contention; that is a problem worth having, and notes/heap.md carries the caveat.
