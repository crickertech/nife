//! **One page this process was handed at a fixed virtual address, read and written by volatile
//! access** (milestone 139).
//!
//! Seven programs each hand-rolled the same four to six functions: `r8`/`w8`/`r16`/`w16`/`r32`,
//! sometimes `r16le`/`w16le` or `a_r8`/`a_w8`, every one of them `unsafe { core::ptr::read_volatile
//! ... }` or its `write_volatile` twin, over either a DMA page a driver's wiring maps before
//! `_start` runs or a shared IPC frame the program `PageFrame::MAP`s itself. `entropy.rs`, `kbd.rs`,
//! `net_transport.rs`, `mdns_responder.rs`, `socket_test_client.rs`, `smb_server.rs` and `ntp.rs`
//! all carried a copy; `ntp.rs`'s own comment named the duplication out loud ("the same shape
//! `net_stack` and `socket_test_client` use") without anyone lifting it out.
//!
//! **The invariant every copy asserted by hand was the same one**: the offset passed in is inside
//! the one page the kernel mapped at a known base VA. Copying that assertion N times is the §94
//! shape (DECISIONS' `design/decisions/94-what-may-live-in-a-library.md`), and nothing checked that
//! any of the N were actually kept inside the page: a wrong offset constant was a silent
//! out-of-bounds volatile access, not a caught bug.
//!
//! [`MappedWindow`] holds the one hand-written assertion, at construction, and turns the other end
//! of it (staying inside the page) into a checked `assert!` instead of a repeated comment. A caller
//! that gets an offset wrong now panics at the access instead of reading or writing past the page
//! silently: this is a real reduction in what can go wrong, not a relocation of the same risk.
//!
//! Round 6 added [`MappedWindow::as_slice`]/[`as_mut_slice`](MappedWindow::as_mut_slice), for a
//! different call shape: a caller that hands the whole page to a parsing or serialization routine
//! rather than reading or writing named fields. Six files (`credentialer.rs`,
//! `credentialer_test_client.rs`, `identity_provisioner.rs`, `login_test_client.rs`,
//! `session_reviver.rs`, `smb_server.rs`) each hand-rolled `core::slice::from_raw_parts[_mut]` over
//! their own shared page, the exact same duplicated-invariant shape as the `r8`/`w8` cluster above,
//! just returning a slice instead of one field.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Bare-metal only, like the rest of this crate (see the crate-level doc for why the examples below
//! are `no_run`).
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use user_rt::mapped_window::{MappedWindow, PAGE};
//!
//! // Constructed once, at the top of the file, the same VA and length every copy hard-coded.
//! const DMA_VA: u64 = 0x0000_0000_0090_0000;
//! // SAFETY: the wiring maps one page read/write at DMA_VA before this program runs.
//! const WINDOW: MappedWindow = unsafe { MappedWindow::new(DMA_VA, PAGE) };
//!
//! // Every access below is safe: bounds-checked against `PAGE`, no unsafe at the call site.
//! WINDOW.w16(0x080, 7);
//! assert_eq!(WINDOW.r16(0x080), 7);
//! ```
//!
//! An offset that would read or write past the window panics instead of touching memory outside
//! it, which is the property no hand-written copy had:
//!
//! ```should_panic
//! # use user_rt::mapped_window::{MappedWindow, PAGE};
//! # const WINDOW: MappedWindow = unsafe { MappedWindow::new(0x0090_0000, PAGE) };
//! WINDOW.r32(PAGE); // one past the last valid u32, deliberately
//! ```
