//! **The machine statistics page: how the box is doing, held as a capability rather than ambient**
//! (milestone 126, DECISIONS §225 (`free` sees the machine and your share) part 2).
//!
//! One read-only page the kernel keeps its machine-wide counters in: physical frames, and per core
//! the ticks spent busy and idle, the context switches, the interrupts taken and the run queue.
//! `free` reads the memory line, `vmstat` reads all of it, and `top`'s summary reads the run queue
//! and the busy share. This crate is the one definition of where each word lives, so the kernel
//! (the one writer) and every reader agree through a dependency rather than two copies of an
//! offset (AGENTS.md rule 7).
//!
//! # A page, not a method, and not ambient
//!
//! §225 ruled the shape: the figures arrive in a page somebody was granted, so an owner can
//! withhold them, and they are read with a load rather than a crossing. Nothing makes the page
//! reachable by default. The progenitor holds the kernel's only capability to it and maps it into a
//! child whose manifest declares `machine`, the same way it hands `date` the clock.
//!
//! # The kernel writes the counters in place
//!
//! There is no copy step and no refresh. Each word is an `AtomicU64` the kernel updates where the
//! event happens: a context switch bumps its core's switch count, a tick bumps its core's busy or
//! idle count and samples its run queue, the frame allocator stores the free count after each change.
//! Every per-core word has exactly one writer, the core it describes, and each core's words sit in
//! their own 64-byte line, so no two cores ever write the same cache line.
//!
//! So a reader sees each word as it was a moment ago, and **the words are not a consistent snapshot
//! of each other**. `busy + idle` on one core can be a tick ahead of another core's. That is the
//! bargain `/proc/stat` makes too, and for the same reason: a seqlock over counters written from
//! the context switch would be a store and a fence on the kernel's hottest path, bought for a
//! consistency no reader of these figures needs.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! A reader over a page a kernel filled, here built on the host from words:
//!
//! ```
//! use machine_statistics_protocol::{Snapshot, WORDS, word};
//!
//! let mut words = [0u64; WORDS];
//! words[word::MAGIC] = u64::from_le_bytes(*b"MACHSTA1");
//! words[word::FRAME_BYTES] = 4096;
//! words[word::TICK_HZ] = 100;
//! words[word::TOTAL_FRAMES] = 32768;
//! words[word::FREE_FRAMES] = 30000;
//! words[word::cpu(0) + word::ONLINE] = 1;
//! words[word::cpu(0) + word::BUSY_TICKS] = 25;
//! words[word::cpu(0) + word::IDLE_TICKS] = 75;
//!
//! let s = Snapshot::from_words(&words).expect("a page the kernel prepared");
//! assert_eq!(s.total_bytes(), 32768 * 4096);
//! assert_eq!(s.online_cpus(), 1);
//! assert_eq!(s.busy_ticks(), 25);
//!
//! // A frame nobody prepared has no answer, rather than an answer of zero.
//! assert!(Snapshot::from_words(&[0u64; WORDS]).is_none());
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - The words are not a consistent snapshot of each other; see above.
//! - `busy` is not split into user and system time. The tick knows which thread was running, not
//!   which privilege level it interrupted, and carrying that through three architectures' trap
//!   paths to one counter was not worth a `vmstat` column. So `vmstat` prints `us` and `sy` as one.
//! - The run queue is sampled once per tick per core, so it is up to one tick stale, and a core
//!   that has stopped ticking (a parked core) keeps its last sample.
//! - There is no swap, no page cache and no block I/O counter here, because the kernel has none of
//!   them to count: the filesystem and the block driver are userspace programs.
//!
//! Name: provisional, minted 2026-09-26 by milestone 126's `free` lane, for the crate and for "the
//! machine statistics page". §225 called it the machine memory page; it carries the scheduler's
//! counters too, because `vmstat` needs them and a second page would be a second grant for one
//! question.
