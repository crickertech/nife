//! **`component_plan`: what a component declares it needs, and how a supervisor wires it**
//! (milestone 23, DECISIONS §41).
//!
//! A component is a swappable, vendor-shippable unit behind a stable contract. §41 says what makes
//! one substitutable: *any program that speaks the protocol and holds the right capabilities **is**
//! the component*. The protocol half of that sentence has always been in a crate. The capability
//! half was a set of literal arrays in the operator's own source, which is the defect milestone 23's
//! roadmap block names in six words: **"endowments are literals in the operator's source."** This
//! crate is the capability half, lifted out to where a declaration can be read, checked, and proved.
//!
//! It performs no IO and makes no syscalls. It turns two declarations into a decision: a
//! [`Requirements`] (what the component says it needs) plus a [`Provisions`] (what the supervisor
//! will route to *this* child) into a [`Plan`] (exactly the capabilities and mappings to endow) or a
//! typed [`Refusal`]. See notes/component-manifest.md.
//!
//! # It is not `grant_plan::Manifest`, and the difference is one sentence
//!
//! [`grant_plan::Manifest`](../grant_plan/struct.Manifest.html) declares **what a human at a prompt
//! may designate** for a program; [`Requirements`] declares **what a supervisor must route before a
//! component can serve anyone**. Four things follow from that, and they are why this is a sibling
//! rather than a subtype:
//!
//! - **There is no command line and no human.** `grant_plan`'s thesis is that designation is
//!   authorization: a person names a file and the naming is the grant. A component is started by a
//!   supervisor with nothing typed, so every field about placing a typed token (`arg`, `flags`,
//!   `file`, `dir`) has no meaning here, and there is no prompt at which to refuse.
//! - **The vocabularies do not overlap.** Nothing in `grant_plan::Manifest` can name an rendezvous, a
//!   device, or a shared page; nothing here can name an argument or a short option.
//! - **A component *serves*, and a program only consumes.** [`Direction`] is the axis this crate
//!   adds, and it is the axis §41's central refusal test turns on: `Serve` is `READ` on an rendezvous
//!   and `Use` is `WRITE`, so a client of the stable rendezvous cannot become its server. `grant_plan`
//!   has no field that could carry that, and no program it spawns would ever set one.
//! - **The keys are different, and this is the one that decides drop-in.** `grant_plan::Manifest` is
//!   reachable only through `Prog`, a closed enum with a static table compiled into the shell, so
//!   admitting a new component would mean editing the shell. [`Requirements`] is a value the
//!   *contract* owns, so a build that speaks the contract is wired by code that never heard of it.
//!
//! What the two **do** share is a shape, and the shape is the reusable idea rather than the struct:
//! a declaration, plus what the wirer holds, checked into an endowment or a typed refusal, before
//! anything is spawned. `grant_plan::plan` and [`plan`] are the same function over different worlds.
//!
//! # A manifest is a request; the provisions are the authority
//!
//! This is Fuchsia's `use`/`offer` split, and it is what keeps a vendor's manifest from being a
//! privilege-escalation surface. A component names its needs, and it can name anything it likes. The
//! supervisor decides, per child, which of its own objects each name resolves to, and a name it did
//! not list resolves to nothing: [`Refusal::Unprovided`], **before the component is built**. So a
//! manifest cannot widen a component's authority; it can only fail to be satisfiable.
//!
//! The corollary is the property that makes a component substitutable at all: **the name is the
//! component's and the object is the supervisor's.** `chatty`'s manifest asks to *use* an rendezvous it
//! calls `service`; on the direct channel the operator routes that to the shared service rendezvous,
//! and on the queued channel it routes the same name to the broker's front rendezvous. One
//! declaration, two wirings, and the component cannot tell which it got.
//!
//! # Structure is a compile error; provisioning is a runtime refusal
//!
//! The two halves are checked on different rungs of the ladder, deliberately.
//!
//! A malformed *declaration* (a role declared twice, two mappings at one address, a component that
//! asks to exist in zero pages) is caught by [`Requirements::problem`], which is a `const fn`. Every
//! real manifest in this tree asserts on it in a `const` item, so a malformed one **does not
//! compile**, on both architectures, without any test having to run.
//!
//! A *provisioning* mismatch cannot be caught that way, because what a supervisor holds is only
//! known when it runs. That is [`plan`]'s job, and its answer is a value the supervisor reports.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! A component declares two capabilities and one page, and a supervisor wires it:
//!
//! ```
//! use component_plan::{CapNeed, Direction, MapNeed, PageKind, Provisions, Requirements};
//!
//! /// The contract's capability half. Lives beside the contract's wire half, not in the operator.
//! pub const TALKER: Requirements = Requirements {
//!     contract: "talker",
//!     caps: &[
//!         CapNeed { role: "service", direction: Direction::Serve },
//!         CapNeed { role: "report", direction: Direction::Use },
//!     ],
//!     maps: &[MapNeed { role: "witness", va: 0x0300_0000, kind: PageKind::Shared }],
//!     pages: 32,
//!     depends_on: &[],
//! };
//!
//! // Malformed declarations do not compile. This one is well formed, so the assertion holds.
//! const _: () = assert!(TALKER.problem().is_none());
//!
//! // The slot a component reads is derived from its own declaration, so the two cannot drift.
//! pub const SERVICE: u64 = component_plan::slot_of(&TALKER, "service");
//! assert_eq!(SERVICE, 0);
//!
//! // The supervisor routes each name to one of its own slots, per child.
//! let plan = component_plan::plan(
//!     &TALKER,
//!     &Provisions { held: &[("service", 5), ("report", 1), ("witness", 9)] },
//! )
//! .expect("every declared role is routed");
//!
//! // Rights come from the declared direction. The supervisor never spells one.
//! assert_eq!(plan.caps(), &[(5, abi::rights::READ), (1, abi::rights::WRITE)]);
//! assert_eq!(plan.maps(), &[(0x0300_0000, 9, abi::address_space::MAP_RW)]);
//! assert_eq!(plan.pages(), 32);
//! ```
//!
//! A supervisor that does not hold what the component asks for is refused, and nothing is built:
//!
//! ```
//! # use component_plan::{CapNeed, Direction, Provisions, Refusal, Requirements};
//! # const TALKER: Requirements = Requirements {
//! #     contract: "talker",
//! #     caps: &[CapNeed { role: "service", direction: Direction::Serve }],
//! #     maps: &[],
//! #     pages: 32,
//! #     depends_on: &[],
//! # };
//! let refused = component_plan::plan(&TALKER, &Provisions { held: &[("report", 1)] });
//! assert_eq!(refused, Err(Refusal::Unprovided { role: "service" }));
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **A manifest is compiled in, not shipped in the archive beside the build.** So a vendor cannot
//! today hand over a binary and have its needs read out of it; what this crate removes is the
//! endowment from the *operator*, not from the tree. Reading a manifest out of an ELF section or an
//! archive member is a format two programs agree on, which is the expensive, irreversible category
//! (AGENTS.md), so it is deliberately left for the architect rather than decided by a lane. See
//! notes/component-manifest.md for what that decision would cost and buy.
//!
//! **[`Requirements::pages`] is a property of the build, not of the contract**, and it is the only
//! field here that is. How many pages an instance needs depends on its image size, its stack and its
//! page tables, so two vendors' builds of one contract can honestly differ. Declaring it per contract
//! is right only while every build of a contract fits the same number, which is true in this tree and
//! is not true in general. It is the strongest single argument for eventually shipping the manifest
//! with the binary.
//!
//! **A malformed declaration's compile error names the manifest, not the role.** `const` evaluation
//! reports an assertion that failed, so the reader is told which `Requirements` is wrong and has to
//! look for the duplicate themselves. [`Requirements::problem`] returns the [`Refusal`] with the role
//! in it, and a host test that calls it prints the good message; the `const` assertion cannot.
//!
//! **[`MAX_CAPS`] and [`MAX_MAPS`] are fixed, and a component past them is refused rather than
//! served.** There is no allocator here and a [`Plan`] is a value, so the bound is a real limit and
//! not a hint. Eight and four are roughly double what any manifest in this tree asks for.
//!
//! **Nothing checks that a supervisor's routed object is the *kind* the role wants.** A supervisor
//! that routes a frame where the component declared an rendezvous gets a plan, and the kernel refuses
//! the `CAP_INSERT` or the component's first `RECV` instead. The declaration carries the direction
//! and the address, which is what a supervisor can get wrong silently; the object type is what the
//! kernel already checks loudly.
//!
//! Name: provisional, minted by this lane (milestone 23). It echoes `grant_plan` on purpose,
//! because the two crates are the same shape over different worlds and the echo is the part worth
//! teaching; the distinguishing word carries the difference. Refused `component_manifest` and
//! `manifest` (a second `Manifest` in a tree that already has `grant_plan::Manifest` is the
//! comprehension disaster this crate's own header argues against), and `capability_declaration` (a
//! declaration is only half of it; the wiring is the other half and is where the checking lives).
