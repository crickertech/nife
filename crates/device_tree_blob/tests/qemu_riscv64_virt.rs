//! Parse the RISC-V virt board's device tree, the second machine we boot on.
//!
//! The aarch64 twin of this file (`qemu_aarch64_virt.rs`) explains why these run on the host. This one
//! exists because the riscv boot path leans on two parser features the aarch64 tree never
//! exercises: a device nested under `/soc` (the PLIC), and the `/reserved-memory` node OpenSBI
//! uses to fence off its own firmware. Without these tests, both paths were only ever executed
//! inside a booting kernel, where a parsing bug surfaces as an allocator handing out firmware
//! RAM, far from its cause.
//!
//! Regenerate the fixture with:
//!
//!     qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt,dumpdtb=f.dtb -nographic
//!     dtc -I dtb -O dts f.dtb -o crates/device_tree_blob/tests/fixtures/qemu-riscv64-virt.dts
//!     (re-add the /reserved-memory node; see the comment in the .dts for why it is hand-added)
//!     dtc -I dts -O dtb crates/device_tree_blob/tests/fixtures/qemu-riscv64-virt.dts \
