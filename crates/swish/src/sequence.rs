//! **Sequencing: `;`, `&&` and `||`, and the one bit that passes between commands** (milestone 67,
//! notes/swish-language.md).
//!
//! This is the outermost split of a typed line, one level above [`grant_plan::line::split`]. It
//! takes what a person typed and cuts it into **segments**, each of which is a whole command line
//! in the sense everything below this already understood: operators, prefix words, redirections,
//! the lot. So nothing under here learned a new grammar.
//!
//! ```text
//! line      := segment (connector segment)*
//! connector := ';' | '&&' | '||'
//! segment   := <a whole command line: stages, operators, prefix words>
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the split is outermost, which is a decision and not a layering accident
//!
//! `caps`, `time` and `xargs` are prefix words whose operand is **a whole command line**, which is
//! why [`crate::route`] answers them before the line is split on `|` (a `caps` that saw only `date`
//! would preview a line the user did not type). Sequencing has the opposite need: `time a && b`
//! must time `a` and then run `b`, not hand `time` the string `a && b`.
//!
//! Splitting here first gives that for free, and it is also bash's binding: a connector joins
//! pipelines, and `time` applies to one pipeline. The cost is named in BUGS.
//!
//! # A connector carries one bit and no capability
//!
//! This is where a shell usually leaks. On Unix a `&&` chain runs inside one process holding one
//! ambient authority, so "what the second command may touch" is a question the connector never has
//! to answer. Here it does, and the answer is that **each segment is planned from scratch against
//! what the shell holds**, exactly as if it had been typed alone:
//!
//! - No file the first segment opened is in scope for the second. The shell backs a `>` itself
//!   (DECISIONS §55) and closes it when the segment is over.
//! - **No pipeline region outlives its segment.** Each pipeline splits a region off the shell's
//!   budget, mints its endpoints in it, and `DESTROY`s it when the line is over, and that destroy is
//!   what turns a stalled writer's next `SEND` into `abi::Error::Gone` (notes/pipes.md). A chain
//!   that reused one region across its segments would keep every earlier segment's endpoints alive
//!   for the whole chain, and a writer parked on the first would never be told. So teardown happens
//!   at the end of a **segment**, not at the end of a line, which falls out of the split being here
//!   rather than inside [`crate::route`].
//! - Nothing a segment was granted is named by [`Status`], which is one small
//!   integer about the shell's own reading of what happened. It designates nothing, so nothing
//!   downstream can be widened by it.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```
//! use grant_plan::Refusal;
//! use swish::sequence::{split, Joint};
//! use swish::Status;
//!
//! let s = split(b"mkdir logs && date > logs/when.txt").unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(s.len(), 2);
//! assert_eq!(s.segments()[0], (Joint::First, &b"mkdir logs"[..]));
//! assert_eq!(s.segments()[1].0, Joint::OnSuccess);
//!
//! // The second only runs if the first did.
//! assert!(Joint::OnSuccess.runs_after(Status::Ran));
//! assert!(!Joint::OnSuccess.runs_after(Status::Refused));
//! // ... and `||` is the mirror. A refusal is a "did not succeed" here, the same as a failure:
//! // `&&` asks one question and both answers are no. Which of the two it was is `$?`'s to say.
//! assert!(Joint::OnFailure.runs_after(Status::Refused));
//!
//! // A connector inside quotes is text, so `echo` can print one.
//! assert_eq!(split(b"echo 'a && b'").unwrap().len(), 1);
//! // And a connector with nothing on one side of it is refused rather than skipped.
//! assert_eq!(split(b"date &&"), Err(Refusal::EmptySegment));
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **There is no grouping.** `a && b || c` is left to right with no precedence between `&&` and
//!   `||`, which is bash's rule, and there is no `{ }` or `( )` to override it. Subshells are
//!   milestone 52's and grouping should arrive with them.
//! - **`time a && b` times only `a`.** That is the binding above and it matches bash, but a person
//!   who wanted the chain timed has no spelling for it until grouping exists.
//! - **A single `&` is an ordinary byte**, so `date &` runs `date` with a word `&` on the line
//!   rather than backgrounding it. Job control is milestone 48's; this module deliberately reads
//!   only the doubled form, so that milestone can give `&` its meaning without taking one away.
//! - **A skipped segment leaves `$?` alone**, which is bash's rule (`false && echo hi` leaves `$?`
//!   at the `false`'s status). A reader who expected "skipped" to be its own status will not find
//!   one, because nothing ran.
