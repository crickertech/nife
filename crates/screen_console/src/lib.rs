//! **Text on a screen, for a machine with no serial port** (milestone 243).
//!
//! Every word nife had ever said, it said down a UART: the boot tour on all three machines, the
//! console server, the kernel's fault reports, and every automated gate that reads any of them.
//! **A commodity machine does not have one.** The six machines in calef's house that milestone 87's
//! USB stick could already boot (two desktops, a laptop, an Intel `MacBook`, cordoba) have between
//! them no serial port at all, and until this crate existed a nife stick booted on one of them
//! would have printed the loader's four lines through the firmware's own console and then gone
//! permanently silent at `ExitBootServices`.
//!
//! This is the smallest thing that fixes that: given a linear framebuffer the previous boot stage
//! found ([`machine_discovery::framebuffer`]) and the tree's existing 7x8 font ([`bitmap_font`]),
//! put bytes on the screen.
//!
//! # Why this is not `video_terminal`
//!
//! `video_terminal::Vt` is the real terminal: a cell grid, a full escape-sequence parser, 300
//! rows of scrollback, damage rectangles. It is the right engine for the interactive terminal
//! (milestone 177 wires it) and it is deliberately **not** used here, for three reasons that all
//! point the same way.
//!
//! - **It is a value of several hundred kilobytes.** Its own documentation says so and warns the
//!   reader off putting one on a stack. In a kernel it would be a static of that size, in `.bss`,
//!   present on every architecture, for a diagnostic path.
//! - **It would put an escape-sequence parser in the TCB.** A state machine over untrusted-ish
//!   bytes is exactly the kind of thing this project keeps *out* of the kernel, and the kernel's
//!   own `println!` emits no escape sequences to parse.
//! - **The thing being reported is often the reason the machine is broken.** That is the block's
//!   own constraint on this milestone, and it argues for the console with the least state that
//!   could work. This one holds a cursor and a geometry: five `u32`s and no buffer.
//!
//! What is deliberately shared is the **font**, so the letters on an early boot screen and the
//! letters in the graphical terminal are the same letters.
//!
//! # What it does not do, and that is a design rather than a gap
//!
//! No colour changes, no escape sequences, no cursor, no scrollback, no reflow. A newline moves
//! down, a carriage return moves to column zero, everything else is a glyph, and running off the
//! bottom scrolls the picture up by one row of cells. **A console that cannot be put into a
//! surprising state is worth more here than a capable one**, because its whole job is to be
//! working at the moment something else is not.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A whole console, painted into ordinary memory, which is exactly what the host tests below do and
//! what makes this crate provable without a screen:
//!
//! ```
//! use machine_discovery::framebuffer::{Framebuffer, PixelOrder};
//! use screen_console::ScreenConsole;
//!
//! // Two cells wide, one tall: 14x8 pixels at four bytes each.
//! let screen = Framebuffer { base: 0, width: 14, height: 8, stride: 56, order: PixelOrder::Bgrx };
//! let mut pixels = [0u8; 56 * 8];
//! let mut console = ScreenConsole::new(screen).expect("a screen big enough for one cell");
//!
//! assert_eq!(console.size(), (2, 1));
//! console.write(&mut pixels, "F");
//!
//! // The top-left pixel of an `F` is background and the one beside it is ink, which is the
//! // property a mirrored or transposed painter gets wrong. See `bitmap_font`'s own example.
//! let pixel = |x: usize, y: usize| u32::from_le_bytes(
//!     pixels[y * 56 + x * 4..y * 56 + x * 4 + 4].try_into().unwrap(),
//! );
//! assert_eq!(pixel(0, 0), ScreenConsole::BACKGROUND);
//! assert_eq!(pixel(1, 0), ScreenConsole::FOREGROUND);
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Scrolling reads the framebuffer back**, one screenful of bytes per scrolled row, and a
//!   framebuffer aperture is mapped uncacheable by every caller this crate has. That is cheap under
//!   QEMU and is the slowest thing here on real silicon; a write-combining mapping or a shadow copy
//!   in RAM would both fix it and both cost more than this milestone is buying. The boot tour is
//!   shorter than a 1280x800 screen is tall, so nothing scrolls during the boot this was built for.
//! - **Only 32-bit pixels.** [`machine_discovery::framebuffer::PixelOrder`] expresses the two byte
//!   orders UEFI reports and nothing else, so a 24-bit packed or 16-bit mode has no console. Every
//!   machine in the fleet reports one of the two.
//! - **On the one real machine that has run this, the screen shows a regular grid instead of
//!   text**, and it is the painting path rather than scrolling or the halt path. Observed on xenon
//!   on 2026-09-04 and 2026-09-17. The discriminating run was the **tour** image on 2026-09-17
//!   (`bench/xenon-2026-09-17/tour-display-225100.log`, video `IMG_4145`): about 40 lines onto a
//!   135-row screen, so **nothing scrolled**, and it ends at a live shell rather than a panic, so
//!   the machine was **not halted**. The grid appeared anyway, which eliminates both of the
//!   explanations the first sighting allowed for.
//!
//!   **The kernel's own geometry is not wrong**: that boot reported `8294400` bytes of
//!   framebuffer, exactly 1920 x 1080 x 4, so [`Framebuffer::span`] and a 7680-byte stride agree
//!   with each other and with the panel. What the screen shows is single pixels at regular
//!   vertical intervals, in columns at regular horizontal intervals, with the columns **leaning**.
//!   A constant lean down the screen is the signature of a fixed per-row drift between the address
//!   this crate computes for row *n* and the address the display scans out for row *n*, which is
//!   what a pitch disagreement produces. That is a hypothesis read off a photograph and **not a
//!   measurement**; counting columns in a JPEG is not evidence this tree accepts.
//!
//!   **The experiment that turns it into a number needs no bench time to write**: paint one
//!   horizontal run of known length at a known row before printing anything. A correct pitch shows
//!   one line; a mismatched one shows a line that steps or wraps, and the step is the delta.
//!
//!   Recorded here rather than fixed because an earlier session nearly wrote up a framebuffer
//!   defect from a photograph of a halted machine that had been displaying text correctly, and the
//!   lesson taken was to name what a photograph can and cannot settle.
//! - **Nothing here is proved on real silicon.** It is proved on the host and under OVMF. A
//!   framebuffer that works under QEMU's emulated adapter is not a framebuffer that works on
//!   Graeme's laptop, and `notes/serial-less-output.md` carries the bench procedure that would
//!   settle it.
//! - **The right-hand and bottom edges are never painted** when the screen is not a whole number of
//!   cells. 1280 is not a multiple of 7, so a 1280-pixel-wide screen owns 182 columns and leaves
//!   six pixels of whatever the firmware last drew. The same is true of `display_terminal`'s
//!   scanout wiring and for the same reason.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-13 (calef, working the unratified worklist), and ruled as half of a pair:
//! `serial_console` and `screen_console` are two consoles over two wires, named for where the text
//! comes out. Coined by milestone 243's lane. The other half is `crates/board_console`, whose
//! rename to `serial_console` is recorded there and not yet performed.
//!
//! A noun, `snake_case`, naming what the thing is rather than how it works: a console on a screen.
//!
//! Refused `framebuffer_console`, because "framebuffer" already names the thing this writes *into*
//! (`machine_discovery::framebuffer`) and a reader meeting both would have to hold two senses of
//! one word. Refused `pixel_console`, which names the unit rather than the surface. Refused
//! `early_console`, which says when it runs rather than what it is, and is wrong about that too:
//! nothing here is early-only.
//!
//! **Refused `video_terminal`, and this is the explanation behind a standing gate NOTE.** That name
//! is taken by the crate this one deliberately is not: `video_terminal` is the terminal *emulator*,
//! holding escape sequences, a cursor and scrollback, where this is a place to put text. Until
//! 2026-09-13 the distinction sat here as a parenthetical rather than a refusal, so
//! `script/names` reported `video_terminal` as recorded-refused-and-also-live with nothing anywhere
//! saying why both are correct.
//!
//! **The NOTE stays, and should.** It flags a word that is refused in one block and live in
//! another, which is exactly true here and is the co-existence a reader should be told about; it
//! is not a complaint that the reason is missing. Checked rather than assumed: the NOTE is still
//! reported after this paragraph was written.
