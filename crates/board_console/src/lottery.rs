//! **Fifty boots in a log, and what the placement lottery drew each time** (milestone 249).
//!
//! [`progress`](crate::progress) reads *one* boot and answers "how far did it get". This module
//! reads a capture of many and answers the question milestone 249 exists for: **how often does each
//! arrangement come up, and does the top of the curve ever get drawn at all?**
//!
//! Nine hand-cycled boots of radon on 2026-09-03 produced a fifteenfold throughput range, and
//! milestone 240's placement census explained it: the rate tracks the number of cores that hold no
//! grinder and do hold part of an IPC group. Those nine landed on two clean cores six times, one
//! twice and zero once. **Three and four have never been drawn**, and nobody knows whether that is
//! rare or structurally impossible. Fifty unattended boots would say; counting them by hand would
//! not be done twice.
//!
//! # What counts as a clean core, stated once and used everywhere
//!
//! A core is **clean** when it carries at least one responder or caller and no grinder.
//!
//! Both halves are load-bearing and both come from measurement rather than from taste, which is
//! recorded at length in notes/soak.md. A grinder is pure compute that never yields, so a core
//! holding one starves whatever IPC threads share it; a core holding no IPC thread at all is idle
//! as far as the round-trip rate is concerned, whatever else is on it. The three arrangements the
//! board has actually drawn line up with the count this produces: two clean cores gave 342-347k/s,
//! one gave 184-188k/s, and none gave 23k/s.
//!
//! **This is a summary of the census and not a theory of it.** Why placement lands where it does is
//! DECISIONS 138's territory. If a series shows the rate does not follow this count, that is the
//! result, and the count is still the right thing to have measured, which is why the report prints
//! the rate beside every draw instead of only the tally.
//!
//! # Which census a draw is judged on
//!
//! **The last one printed**, not the first. The kernel prints a census at spawn and reprints it
//! whenever `drifted=` says the old one stopped being true, and on radon the spawn arrangement is
//! replaced about twenty-five seconds in by one that then holds for hours. The spawn census is the
//! lottery's *ticket*; the settled one is what the machine ran.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A draw with no census at all is still a draw**, and it reports `clean=?`. A pre-milestone-240
//!   kernel prints no census, and a boot truncated before its first one has none yet. Both are
//!   counted in the series and excluded from the distribution, because dropping them would make a
//!   log of forty good boots and ten wedged ones read as forty boots.
//! - **A boot that never reaches `soak: started` is invisible except as an attempt.** The counts
//!   are printed side by side for exactly that reason: `attempts` above `draws` is the shape of
//!   "three boots and then a wedge at 2am", which is the failure an unattended series is most
//!   likely to suffer and the one nothing else here would report.
//! - **The attempt count is U-Boot SPL's banner**, so it counts boots of the *board* rather than of
//!   this kernel, and it counts zero on a QEMU capture, which has no SPL. A QEMU rehearsal
//!   therefore reports fewer attempts than draws, which is honest and looks odd.
//! - **Nothing here reads the rate as a function of anything.** It prints the pairs. Fitting a
//!   curve to fifty points from one board would be a stronger claim than fifty points support.
