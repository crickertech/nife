//! **Reading a screen the way [`super::watch`] reads a wire** (milestone 243).
//!
//! Milestone 216 gave a gate a way to read a board it cannot see: open the serial port, log the
//! bytes, judge how far the boot got. **Six of the machines in calef's house have no serial port**,
//! and on those nife's console is a framebuffer (`screen_console`). This module is the other half
//! of the same tool: it turns a *picture* of that framebuffer back into the text that was written
//! into it, so that everything in [`super::progress`] applies unchanged.
//!
//! # Why this is possible at all, and is not optical character recognition
//!
//! [`bitmap_font`] is a constant table of monochrome 7x8 glyphs, so the picture a character
//! produces is a pure function of the character. Reading it back is therefore an exact table
//! lookup rather than a guess: **a cell either matches a glyph bit for bit or it matches nothing**,
//! and there is no threshold to tune and no confidence to report. That property is the same one
//! `bitmap_font`'s own documentation claims for the writing direction, used backwards.
//!
//! It also means this is worthless on any screen nife did not draw. A firmware splash decodes to
//! nothing, which is the correct answer.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! Two things, and the second is the one that could not be done before.
//!
//! - Under QEMU, `cargo xtask uefi-boot` asks the emulator for a screendump and reads the tour off
//!   it. That gates the whole framebuffer path on every run: the loader's `LocateProtocol`, the
//!   byte order, the stride, the mapping surviving `mmu::init`, and the glyphs.
//! - On a machine nobody can attach a cable to, a **photograph of the screen** is not this: it is
//!   not pixel-aligned and it is not a screendump. Turning one into text is a different problem
//!   this module does not solve, and `notes/serial-less-output.md` says so where a reader meets it.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use board_console::screen;
//!
//! // A two-by-one grid of 7x8 cells, in the PPM QEMU's `screendump` writes.
//! let mut ppm = b"P6\n14 8\n255\n".to_vec();
//! for y in 0..8 {
//!     for x in 0..14 {
//!         let ink = bitmap_font::ink(if x < 7 { 'h' } else { 'i' }, x % 7, y);
//!         ppm.extend_from_slice(if ink { &[0xc8, 0xc8, 0xc8] } else { &[0, 0, 0] });
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! assert_eq!(screen::read(&ppm).unwrap(), "hi\n");
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Trailing blanks are trimmed and leading ones are not.** A framebuffer console pads every row
//!   to the full width with background, so keeping them would make every line 182 characters long
//!   and every substring search in [`super::progress`] still work but every printed transcript
//!   unreadable. Leading blanks are the indentation the boot tour actually uses.
//! - **A cell that matches no glyph reads as `?`**, not as an error. A screen is a picture and part
//!   of it may be something else entirely (a firmware logo the console did not clear over, half a
//!   character at the right edge); refusing the whole dump for one cell would throw away the
//!   ninety-nine percent that decoded.
//! - **Several characters share a glyph in a 7x8 font.** The lookup returns the first match in
//!   ASCII order, so a font with a duplicate would silently prefer the earlier character. Nothing
//!   currently checks `bitmap_font` for duplicate glyphs.
//! - **Only [`INK`] on [`PAPER`] is recognised.** Any other colour scheme decodes to blanks. The
//!   kernel console has exactly one and this reads it.
