//! **A board's firmware prologue, declared rather than hard-coded** (milestone 324 part 3).
//!
//! calef ruled on 2026-09-19: *one tool with a board profile, and the profile is the firmware
//! prologue only*. A tool per board would fork 3,545 lines whose portable majority is already
//! proven shared, and this module is the other half of that ruling: the part that is **not**
//! shared, written as data instead of as a run of `if line.contains(...)` inside
//! [`crate::progress`].
//!
//! # The split, which was already in the source before it was a design
//!
//! [`crate::progress::Stage`] was two things in one enum. Its lower rungs (`U-Boot SPL`, OpenSBI,
//! U-Boot proper, `Starting kernel ...`) are **the VisionFive 2's firmware chain**, true of radon
//! and of nothing else this project owns. Its upper rungs (banner, machine, self-test, tour,
//! prompt, and the workloads above them) are **the kernel's own ladder**, and milestone 268 made
//! every one of them reachable on all three architectures. Nothing in the file said so. Milestone
//! 324's block said it, and this module is that sentence made mechanical: the prologue is a
//! `&'static Profile`, the ladder is the enum, and adding a board is adding a [`Profile`] rather
//! than editing a recogniser.
//!
//! # What a profile may and may not contain
//!
//! Only what the **firmware** prints, before the kernel has run an instruction. Three kinds:
//!
//! - [`Profile::prologue`], the ordered rungs. Order is the whole of their meaning.
//! - [`Profile::refusals`], the ways that firmware gives up before handing over. These belong here
//!   and not in the shared half because `Bad Linux RISCV Image magic!` and
//!   `### ERROR ### Please RESET the board ###` are U-Boot's words: a board with different
//!   firmware refuses differently, or does not refuse at all.
//! - [`Profile::relocation`], a discriminator that is deliberately not a rung. The triage ladder in
//!   `notes/visionfive2.md` lists `Moving Image from` as the thing to check when
//!   `Starting kernel ...` is followed by silence, which is a different question from how far the
//!   boot got.
//!
//! Everything the kernel prints stays out. A profile that named our banner would be a second copy
//! of `crates/boot_ladder`, which is the mistake that crate exists to have already made once.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Only [`RADON`] has ever been checked against a machine, and [`XENON`]'s emptiness is the
//!   claim rather than an omission.** radon's four rungs and both refusals are asserted against
//!   bytes off the wire on 2026-09-01, in `tests/fixtures/captured/`. xenon's prologue is empty
//!   because `bench/xenon-2026-09-17/first-light-095500.log` shows nothing before our banner that
//!   this tool matches: it boots through PVH straight into `nife on `, so the portable half of the
//!   ladder is its whole boot. An empty prologue is therefore a measurement, but it is a
//!   measurement of **one capture on one day**, and a xenon that fell over inside its firmware
//!   would print something nothing here would name.
//! - **argon has no profile and deliberately gets none.** It has never booted nife and sits behind
//!   milestone 127, which is NOT-STARTED. A profile written for it today would be a Jetson boot
//!   chain read out of vendor documentation and never watched on a wire, which is the
//!   assertion-shaped-as-measurement failure this tree keeps catching. Its prologue stays unwritten
//!   until a board prints something.
//! - **The default is [`RADON`], and a default that names a board is a foot gun.** It is what every
//!   caller watched before profiles existed, so taking it changed nothing; what it does is make a
//!   report from an unconfigured session say it was expecting a VisionFive 2. The three QEMU
//!   callers in `xtask` (`boot-check`, `soak-test`, `job-mix`) name [`XENON`] instead, which is the
//!   honest description of a machine with no firmware prologue, and it changes no behaviour either
//!   way: a marker that never arrives is never matched.
//! - **A [`Rung`] compares by depth alone**, so rung 2 of one profile equals rung 2 of another.
//!   This is an accepted exception to *make the wrong state unrepresentable*, and it is a foot gun:
//!   a session has exactly one profile, chosen once before any byte is read, so two profiles' rungs
//!   never meet. Making them un-comparable would mean ordering [`crate::progress::Stage`] by hand
//!   against a profile it does not carry, which is more machinery in exchange for a state nothing
//!   can reach.
//! - **Nothing gates a profile against the board it claims to describe.** The same gap
//!   `crates/boot_ladder` records against the kernel, one level out, and the same mechanism:
//!   review, plus a capture in `tests/fixtures/captured/` for every rung anybody asserts on.
//!
//! Names provisional, this lane's coinage (2026-09-19, milestone 324 part 3). `Profile` is the word
//! calef's own ruling used (*"a board profile"*), so it is his already; `Rung` is
//! `crates/boot_ladder`'s word for the same shape one level up and is reused rather than reinvented;
//! `Sign` was chosen over `Match` (a verb, and the tree asks for nouns) and over `Pattern` (which
//! promises a regular expression this deliberately is not).
