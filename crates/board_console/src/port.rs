//! **Finding the board's serial port and putting it in the right mode**, with no dependency.
//!
//! # Why `stty` and not a serial crate
//!
//! Configuring a UART is one `tcsetattr` call, and the two ordinary ways to make it from Rust are
//! the `serialport` crate or `libc` plus the `termios` struct by hand. Both are new dependencies in
//! the shipping graph, and §46 (thin primitives or whole subsystems; we write everything in
//! between) makes taking one a decision rather than a convenience; this is a lane, and a lane does
//! not take that decision. `stty(1)` makes the same
//! call, is in every base system, and has been since the 1970s. The price is a process spawn per
//! session and a diagnostic that is a program's stderr rather than an `errno`, which is a fair
//! trade for a tool that runs once a boot.
//!
//! If this ever needs to *write* to the board with flow control, or set a non-standard baud, the
//! trade changes and the dependency is worth proposing. It does not need either today.
//!
//! # The ordering that is not arbitrary, and the thing it cost somebody
//!
//! **Open the device first, then run `stty` on it, then check that the speed took.** Opening a
//! macOS `cu` device resets its termios towards the driver's default, so a configuration made
//! before the read descriptor exists is undone by the open that follows it. Holding the descriptor
//! is also what keeps the setting alive: it reverts when the last user closes.
//!
//! **This is not a theory.** calef's first capture of the VisionFive 2 on 2026-09-01 was pure
//! garbage, because it configured the port with `stty` and then ran `cat`, and `cat`'s open put
//! the device back to the default rate. It looks exactly like a wiring fault or a bad adapter,
//! which is the runbook's second triage row, and it cost a power cycle to diagnose.
//!
//! So the read-back below is a gate rather than a nicety: it asks the device what speed it is
//! actually at and says so loudly when the answer is not 115200. An invisible wrong baud produces
//! plausible-looking bytes and sends the next person chasing hardware; a stated one takes a
//! second to fix.
//!
//! **The residual hazard, stated rather than hidden.** Because the configuration is a separate
//! process rather than a `tcsetattr` on our own descriptor, any *other* process that opens this
//! device mid-session can put it back to the default, and nothing here would notice. That is the
//! honest cost of having no dependency, and it is the case that would justify taking one.
//!
//! # `O_NONBLOCK`
//!
//! Not used, and the reason is that it would be redundant here. Its job would be to stop a silent
//! board hanging the tool in `read`, and `watch` already guarantees that structurally by doing the
//! read on a worker thread while the deadline runs on a channel timeout. That guarantee holds even
//! when the `stty` above fails outright, which `O_NONBLOCK` on its own would not: a non-blocking
//! read returns immediately, but only a deadline decides when to stop asking.
//!
//! # And why `cu.` rather than `tty.`
//!
//! On macOS `/dev/tty.*` is the dial-in side and blocks in `open` until carrier detect asserts,
//! which a three-wire console cable never does. That is the classic way a serial tool hangs before
//! printing anything at all, and it hangs in `open`, where no deadline of ours has started yet.
//! `/dev/cu.*` is the call-out side and opens immediately.
