//! **The loop that cannot hang**, which is the whole difficulty of this milestone.
//!
//! Reading a serial port is one `open` and one `read`. Knowing when to stop reading is the part
//! that has kept every board milestone waiting on a person with eyes, and it has three answers,
//! all of which have to be here at once: the boot got where it was going, the board announced a
//! failure, or nothing more is coming.
//!
//! # Why the read happens on another thread
//!
//! Because the deadline must hold **whatever the reader does**. `port::configure` asks the tty
//! layer for a read timeout (`min 0 time 10`), and when that works a read returns on its own after
//! a tenth of a second. When it does not work, and there are several ordinary ways for it not to
//! (an `stty` that failed and was only warned about, a device that ignores the setting, a file or
//! a pipe standing in for a port), a read blocks forever and a single-threaded loop blocks with it.
//!
//! So the read runs on a worker and this loop waits on a channel with a timeout. The worker may
//! still be parked in `read` when we decide to stop; that is fine, because deciding to stop means
//! returning, and the process exits, and the descriptor goes with it. What must never happen is
//! this loop waiting on the board's goodwill, and it never does. This is `CLAUDE.md`'s
//! `Never leave QEMU running` rule wearing different clothes: an emulator that never exits and a
//! board that never speaks are the same bug from the tool's side.
