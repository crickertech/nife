//! **How far did the boot get?**, decided from the console text alone.
//!
//! Every marker below is quoted from something in this tree rather than remembered: the bench
//! runbook in `notes/visionfive2.md` ("What appears, in order, on a good day" and the
//! failure-triage ladder), and `kernel/src/main.rs` and `kernel/src/panic.rs` for the lines that
//! are ours. Nothing here was invented, which matters more than usual, because a recogniser that
//! matches text no board ever prints fails in the direction that looks like success.
//!
//! **And every one of them has now been checked against the board**, which is a different and
//! better claim than "quoted from documentation" and was not available when this was written.
//! calef captured a full boot and a full failure on 2026-09-01; both are in
//! `tests/fixtures/captured/` and both are asserted on. The documentation was right about the
//! seven markers it named. It was silent about two things the board does, and both are here now:
//! U-Boot refusing outright before the kernel runs, and the line that means our whole boot tour
//! finished rather than merely started.
//!
//! # Two halves, and only one of them is this board's
//!
//! **The firmware prologue is a board profile and lives in [`crate::board`]** (milestone 324 part
//! 3). `U-Boot SPL`, OpenSBI, U-Boot proper and `Starting kernel ...` are radon's firmware chain
//! and nobody else's; they used to be four `if line.contains(...)` arms here and four variants of
//! [`Stage`], which is the hard-coding calef's ruling named. They are now declared as data, and a
//! boot that climbs them reaches [`Stage::Firmware`].
//!
//! **Everything from [`Stage::Banner`] up is the kernel's own ladder**, reachable on all three
//! architectures since milestone 268, and it is shared by every board this tool will ever watch.
//! `crates/boot_ladder` holds its markers; a board profile may not name one.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **A marker is shared; the fields inside the line are not, and that gap is silent.** The sweep's
//! seven heads are `crates/job_mix`'s own constants, so a kernel that renames one cannot disagree
//! with this file. Everything after the head is matched here by a string literal that exists
//! nowhere else: `tasks=`, `ticks_median=`, `rounds=`, `beat=`. A kernel that renames a field, or
//! inserts one, still prints a line this recogniser matches, and the parse reads **nothing** while
//! every test stays green.
//!
//! That is not hypothetical. On **2026-09-19** two sessions did it to each other inside a day. One
//! lane moved the markers into `crates/job_mix`; another changed
//! `kernel/src/job_mix.rs`'s point line from `ticks=<t> jpm=<r>` to a median of 21 repeats with its
//! two ends, so `ticks=` and `jpm=` stopped existing. The head `job-mix: tasks=` never moved.
//! Both branches were green: the parser and the committed fixture had been made from the same old
//! kernel and agreed with each other, and neither agreed with the kernel. It was found by reading,
//! which is rung zero of `AGENTS.md`'s ladder.
//!
//! Two things blunt it and neither closes it. The fixtures are **captures from a real boot** rather
//! than hand-written lines, so re-capturing catches a rename the moment somebody re-captures; and
//! this module's fields are spelled exactly as the wire spells them, so the two can be diffed by
//! eye. Sharing the field names the way the heads are shared is the fix, and it is not built here.
//!
//! **A sweep's longest legitimate silence is a measurement, and it belongs to the machine that
//! measured it.** The quiet timer that `script/job-mix` and `script/board-console` set against
//! [`Stage::Sweep`] is sized against the slowest subrun at the top of `job_mix::TASK_SWEEP`, since
//! a sweep has no wall-clock heartbeat to miss. Under TCG on 2026-09-19 that subrun was
//! 249,234,771 ticks on a 62.5 MHz counter, which is **4.0 seconds**, from the capture in
//! `tests/fixtures/captured/`. The default is sixty seconds, fifteen times it. That margin used to
//! be twenty to one against a 2.6-second subrun, and milestone 168 spent a quarter of it by taking
//! twenty-one repeats of a seven-kind mix instead of three of a five-kind one; a figure quoted from
//! a capture is only as current as the capture. A board outside the margin reads as wedged when it
//! is merely slow, and `--quiet-after 0` is the escape that gives up the detection entirely.
