//! **The entropy contract** (milestone 56; DECISIONS §44, notes/entropy.md).
//!
//! One definition of the request and the reply that carry random bytes out of the entropy service,
//! so the service, its clients, the std PAL and the kernel-side tests cannot drift. The same split
//! `filesystem_proto` makes for the filesystem and `clock_proto` for the wall clock.
//!
//! # The shape, and why it is this small
//!
//! ```text
//!   the virtio-rng device (a Virtio capability, one holder)
//!             │
//!   ┌─────────▼────────┐
//!   │ entropy service  │◄──an endpoint──── a client that may OBTAIN randomness
//!   └──────────────────┘   (CALL, bytes    and may not reach the device
//!                           in the reply)
//! ```
//!
//! A client `CALL`s with a byte count and gets the bytes back **in the reply words**. There is no
//! shared page, which is the one design choice in here worth arguing about, so it is argued about
//! in DECISIONS §44: bulk normally rides in a page (§10), but a page shared with a client is a
//! place the bytes *persist* and a second party can read, and random bytes are the payload whose
//! whole value is that nobody else has seen them. Registers and the client's own stack are a
//! smaller footprint than a page both parties map. The cost is one round trip per
//! [`MAX_BYTES`] bytes, which is what the `entropy_rtt` benchmark prices.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The one thing a client of this contract must get right is that **a reply is eight bytes, so
//! filling anything larger is a loop**. That is the cost DECISIONS §44 accepted in exchange for
//! never putting random bytes in a page a second party maps, so it is what an example should show:
//! a twenty-byte key takes three round trips, and the last one is short.
//!
//! ```
//! use entropy_proto::{GET, MAX_BYTES, delivered, op, req, take, want};
//!
//! // Stands in for the `CALL`: the real service reads the same two accessors off the request word
//! // and answers with a count and a word of bytes.
//! fn service(w0: u64) -> (u64, u64) {
//!     assert_eq!(op(w0), GET);
//!     (want(w0), 0x0807_0605_0403_0201)
//! }
//!
//! let mut key = [0u8; 20];
//! let mut filled = 0;
//! let mut round_trips = 0;
//! while filled < key.len() {
//!     let (r0, r1) = service(req(GET, (key.len() - filled) as u64));
//!     round_trips += 1;
//!     // `None` would mean the word is a kernel error rather than a count. See below.
//!     let n = delivered(r0).expect("the service answered");
//!     assert_ne!(n, 0, "a zero count is NO_ENTROPY: fail, do not retry");
//!     filled += take(n, r1, &mut key[filled..]);
//! }
//! assert_eq!(round_trips, 3); // 8 + 8 + 4, because MAX_BYTES is 8
//! assert_eq!(MAX_BYTES, 8);
//! assert_eq!(&key[16..], &[0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04]);
//! ```
//!
//! The other property worth stating as code is the one [`delivered`] exists for, because it is a
//! claim about two number spaces *not* overlapping. A program holding no entropy capability at all
//! gets a kernel error in the register a count would have arrived in, and it does not have to probe
//! to find out which it is holding:
//!
//! ```
//! use entropy_proto::{MAX_BYTES, NO_ENTROPY, delivered};
//!
//! // Every count the service can send.
//! for n in 0..=MAX_BYTES {
//!     assert_eq!(delivered(n), Some(n as usize));
//! }
//! // `abi::Error` is -1 to -8; as a u64 each is enormous, so none can be read as a count.
//! assert_eq!(delivered(-4i64 as u64), None); // an empty slot: no entropy capability
//!
//! // And "the service has none to give" is a third answer, distinct from both.
//! assert_eq!(delivered(NO_ENTROPY), Some(0));
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **A true all-zero first draw would be misread as a dead device, and this is the one place the
//! contract knowingly gets an answer wrong.** [`readiness`] refuses a first bufferful of zeros, so
//! a source that legitimately produced one at bring-up is condemned for the boot: 2^-64 for the
//! instruction backend's eight bytes, 2^-256 for the JH7110's thirty-two, 2^-2048 for the
//! virtio backend's bufferful. The trade is deliberate and is the right way round. **A false
//! "the device is dead" costs one boot's entropy; a false "the device is alive" costs every secret
//! derived from it**, and the second failure has no symptom, which is the whole reason
//! [`NO_ENTROPY`] exists two paragraphs down from [`READY`].
//!
//! **The check is bring-up only, and so are its guarantees.** A source that answers correctly once
//! and degrades afterwards, or one whose register file latches and repeats the same nonzero answer
//! forever, passes [`readiness`] and is not caught anywhere in this crate. That is continuous
//! health testing, it is a decision rather than an omission, and it is
//! `design/decisions/137-trng-health-tests.md`'s to make: 137 has to answer what a *running*
//! service does when a test fails, which is a denial-of-service question this readiness handshake
//! does not have (nothing depends on the service yet at the moment it reports). Nothing here
//! pre-empts that decision, and the only client-side check that exists today is the riscv64 boot
//! tour's own two-draw comparison, which is a client looking rather than the service checking.
//!
//! # Nothing here transforms a byte
//!
//! The service passes the device's bytes through. It does not hash, mix, whiten, or stretch them,
//! and this crate has no arithmetic in it at all for exactly that reason: with no cryptographic
//! primitive in the tree (that is the other half of milestone 56), any "whitening" would be a
//! reversible permutation that changes the bytes without adding an unpredictability an attacker
//! could not undo. The security property is therefore statable in one sentence: **these are the
//! device's bytes**, and the device is named in the notes.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review, confirming
//! milestone 46's own reasoning). The wire contract was spelled four ways (`filesystem_proto`,
//! `graphics_proto`, `netproto`, `line_editor::proto`) for one concept; `*_proto` won on
//! 2026-07-30 under DECISIONS §39, and `script/lint` has checked it since.
//! The stem is the service's own word (`entropy`, DECISIONS §44), which is itself unrecorded.
