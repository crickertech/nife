#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]
//! **The C seam's shared half** (milestone 36, DECISIONS §31).
//!
//! Two Rust programs sit either side of the foreign component: `c_shim` is the shell that links the
//! C and calls it, and `c_confiner` is the process that builds `c_shim`, supervises it, and holds
//! the witness pages that prove what the C could not reach. This is what they agree on: the
//! address-space layout, the report protocol, and the constants that are also written down in
//! `user/c/c_seam.c`.
//!
//! A crate rather than a `#[path]` module since 2026-08-01 (CLAUDE.md rule 7): what two binaries
//! must agree on is a crate, so that the agreement is reachable by host tests and by Kani. The test
//! at the bottom of this file is what that bought.
//!
//! # The layout, and why these numbers
//!
//! ```text
//!   c_shim (the C component's process)          c_confiner (the checker)
//!   ------------------------------------       -----------------------------------------
//!   0x0040_0000  text / rodata / data          0x0040_0000  text / rodata / data
//!   0x0050_0000  stack                         0x0050_0000  stack
//!   0x4000_0000  heap (malloc/free)            0x2000_0000  the initrd, read-only
//!   0x5000_0000  GRANT       1 page, RW  <---> 0x5000_0000  the same frame, RW
//!   0x5000_1000  WITNESS_RO  1 page, RO  <---> 0x5000_1000  the same frame, RW
//!   0x5000_2000  NOTHING (unmapped)            0x5000_2000  a different frame, RW
//! ```
//!
//! The two witness pages answer two different questions, which is why there are two:
//!
//! - **`WITNESS_RO` is the same physical page, present in the C component's own page tables.** So
//!   when the off-by-one store does not change it, that is not "the write went somewhere else"; the
//!   page was right there, reachable, and the write did not happen. This is the stronger witness.
//! - **`WITNESS_FAR` is a different physical page at the same virtual address.** The C component has
//!   no mapping at `0x5000_2000` at all, and the checker does. So when a wild store to that address
//!   does not change the checker's page, that is the statement "a virtual address means nothing
//!   outside the address space that owns it," which is the MMU claim, made concrete.
//!
//! Both patterns are position-derived, the discipline milestone 29 used for the framebuffer: a
//! partial overwrite is detected, and a `memset` of any single value could not pass.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Everything in here that is arithmetic rather than a layout number is host-testable, which is the
//! whole reason rule 7 made this a crate instead of a `#[path]` module. The checksum is the piece
//! that matters: it is a Rust recomputation of what the C returns, so it is **two implementations of
//! one definition** rather than an echo of whatever the C happened to produce.
//!
//! ```
//! use c_seam::{INPUT, expected_checksum};
//!
//! let sum = expected_checksum(INPUT);
//!
//! // The uppercasing is folded into the hash, matching `c_seam_transform`, so the input's case
//! // cannot change the answer. A C side that skipped the transform would not land on this number.
//! assert_eq!(expected_checksum(b"nife"), expected_checksum(b"NIFE"));
//! assert_ne!(expected_checksum(b"nife"), sum);
//!
//! // FNV-1a over the input the checker writes before every attempt, including its NUL. This is the
//! // number `c_seam_transform` has to put in the grant's output area for the honest attempt to pass.
//! assert_eq!(sum, 0x61a0_7dae);
//! ```
//!
//! The witness patterns are position-derived, and the two properties that buys are worth asserting
//! because both are about what *cannot* pass:
//!
//! ```
//! use c_seam::{MARK, pattern_far, pattern_ro};
//!
//! // No two adjacent bytes agree, so a `memset` of any single value fails, and so does a partial
//! // overwrite. This is milestone 29's framebuffer discipline applied to one page.
//! for i in 0..64 {
//!     assert_ne!(pattern_ro(i), pattern_ro(i + 1));
//!     assert_ne!(pattern_far(i), pattern_far(i + 1));
//! }
//!
//! // Two different generators, so a checker bug that read the wrong page would not accidentally
//! // agree with the page it should have read.
//! assert!((0..64).any(|i| pattern_ro(i) != pattern_far(i)));
//!
//! // And the byte the misbehaving C stores differs from both at offset 0, which is the only offset
//! // either of them targets. So "the witness is unchanged" cannot hold by accident.
//! assert_ne!(MARK, pattern_ro(0));
//! assert_ne!(MARK, pattern_far(0));
//! ```
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 61), when the C symbols became `c_seam_*` and the
//! file left `user/src/` under rule 7. Refused `cseam` (run together, and it sat among 48 programs
//! while being none of them, which is one of the cases that produced the rule). The `c_` prefix
//! means "written in C" (DECISIONS §31).
