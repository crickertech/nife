//! **`top`: the same domain `ps` lists, ordered by what it is costing** (milestone 282 (a thread's CPU time, and the `top` it makes possible),
//! DECISIONS §150 (how does a thread's CPU time reach userspace?), notes/process-view.md).
//!
//! This is the program's logic, lifted out so it runs on the host in milliseconds;
//! `components/src/top.rs` is the syscalls and the two output streams and nothing else. The crate
//! and the program share a name because they are one thing split at the IO boundary, the same pair
//! `ps`, `coremark` and `line_editor` already are.
//!
//! # The name had to be earned, and this is what earned it
//!
//! `top` means *the top N by resource consumption*: it is defined by ranking, and until there was
//! something to rank by the name would have overclaimed. `ps`'s table was `TID` and `STATE`, two
//! columns with no order to put them in, which is why milestone 126 (who else is running, and who is allowed to ask) shipped `ps` and
//! deliberately did not ship this. `abi::survey::record::CPU_TIME` is what changed, and it is a
//! **measurement** rather than an estimate: §150 refused wall-clock age (a thread that slept five
//! minutes and one that ran five minutes read identically) and refused userspace sampling (a thread
//! that runs between two samples is invisible), on the ground that a name like this one must not be
//! attached to a number that does not mean what the name says.
//!
//! # What this holds that `crates/ps` does not
//!
//! Almost nothing, and that is the honest answer rather than a modest one. The walk is
//! [`ps::collect`], the second walk that fills the CPU column is
//! [`ps::Survey::join_cpu_time`], the ordering is [`ps::Survey::rank_by_cpu_time`] and the table is
//! [`ps::Survey::write_report`]. What lives here is the **summary line**, which is the one thing a
//! ranked view needs and a listing does not: how many threads there are in total, what they are
//! doing, and how long the machine has been counting. Unix's `top` opens with the same three facts
//! for the same reason, which is that a ranked table shows you the head of a distribution and tells
//! you nothing about its size.
//!
//! **Whether this should be a program at all is calef's**, and the argument is live rather than
//! settled. Milestone 281 (`watch` holds exactly what `ps` holds) deleted `watch` on the finding that *two programs are two programs when
//! they hold different authority*, and `top` holds exactly `ps`'s three slots. What is different
//! here is the question asked rather than the authority held: `ps` answers *what exists*, in the
//! kernel's own order, and `top` answers *what is consuming*, in order of consumption. Folding it
//! back into `ps` as a flag is a day's work and stays available; see this crate's `BUGS`.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//! $ top
//! up 00:01:12, 4 threads: 1 running, 1 ready, 1 blocked, 1 dead
//!          TID  STATE     TIME(ms)
//!            9  running        310
//! 4294967302  dead             150
//!            5  blocked         20
//!            7  ready            0
//! ```
//!
//! And the refusal, which reads exactly as `ps`'s does, because it is `ps`'s:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ top        top: this process holds no process-domain capability
//! ```
//!
//! The summary line is the host-testable part, and it needs no kernel:
//!
//! ```
//! use ps::Row;
//!
//! let rows = [
//!     Row { tid: 5, state: abi::survey::RUNNING, cpu_millis: Some(310) },
//!     Row { tid: 9, state: abi::survey::DEAD, cpu_millis: Some(10) },
//! ];
//! let mut text = Vec::new();
//! top::write_summary(&rows, 72_000_000_000, &mut |b| text.extend_from_slice(b));
//! let line = String::from_utf8(text).unwrap();
//! assert!(line.starts_with("up 00:01:12, 2 threads: "), "{line}");
//! assert!(line.contains("1 running"), "{line}");
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **There is no live refresh, and that is a decision rather than a gap.** The obvious `top`
//!   redraws on an interval, and this kernel has **no timed wait**: the interval `watch` used was a
//!   yield-spin over the ambient monotonic counter, which burns a whole core for the length of the
//!   wait. That was merely wasteful in a program showing two columns of text. It is *corrupting*
//!   here, because the spin would be charged to this program's own thread by the very counter the
//!   table ranks on, and `top` would truthfully report itself as the busiest thread on the machine.
//!   A refresh arrives when a timed wait does (milestone 106 (a wait that ends on either the interrupt or the deadline)'s fork), not before.
//! - **No `%CPU` column**, for the same root cause. A percentage is a ratio of CPU time to elapsed
//!   time over an *interval*, so it needs two samples, and one invocation of this program is one
//!   sample. What is printed instead is the cumulative figure, which is Unix `top`'s own `TIME+`
//!   column and is the honest thing a single sample supports. A cumulative percentage against
//!   uptime was considered and refused: a thread born a second ago and one born at boot would be
//!   divided by the same denominator, which is the wall-clock-age error §150 refused, moved into the
//!   printer.
//! - **`top` cannot be asked for the top *N*.** `ArgSpec` (`crates/grant_plan`) is `Required` or
//!   `Forbidden` with nothing between, so a program with an optional integer cannot be declared, and
//!   a `top` that *required* one could not be typed bare. Every row is printed, ranked. This is the
//!   same boundary limitation `crates/pgrep`'s `BUGS` records for its missing pattern.
//! - **The summary counts what the survey returned, not what the machine holds.** A domain is the
//!   supervision subtree the caller was endowed, so "4 threads" means four in *this* domain; the
//!   idle threads, the kernel's own threads and every other domain are not in it and must not be.
//!   That is the difference from Unix's `top`, whose header counts the machine because `/proc` is
//!   ambient.
//! - **Ties are broken by tid, so an idle machine ranks in slot order.** With every figure at zero
//!   the "ranking" is no ranking at all, which is truthful and can read as a bug to somebody who
//!   typed `top` on a quiet system.
//!
//! Name: provisional. `top` is the name every reader already knows from outside this project, which
//! the naming tenet calls the best name available for a standard term, and it is the name DECISIONS
//! §150 (how does a thread's CPU time reach userspace?) and milestone 281 (`watch` holds exactly what `ps` holds) both anticipated for this program by name. It is
//! provisional because calef has not ruled on it and because the prior question is whether this is a
//! program or a flag on `ps`; see the module docs above.
