//! **Asking the emulator for a screen** (milestone 243): QEMU's `fw_cfg` interface, wire side.
//!
//! Milestone 243 put the kernel's boot tour on a screen on `x86_64`, where UEFI's
//! `EFI_GRAPHICS_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL` hands the loader a linear framebuffer that is already lit.
//! `aarch64` and `riscv64` had no such stage: QEMU's `virt` boards are entered straight from
//! `-kernel` with no firmware that has configured a display, so
//! [`machine_discovery::framebuffer`]'s sentence had nobody to say it and `screen_console` had
//! nothing to paint.
//!
//! What those boards do have is **`ramfb`**, a QEMU device whose whole contract is that *the guest*
//! supplies the memory and then tells the emulator where it is. The telling goes through `fw_cfg`,
//! which is the same channel firmware already uses to read the E820 map, the kernel command line
//! and the ACPI tables. This crate is that conversation's wire format, and nothing else: no MMIO,
//! no pointers, no device. The four structures below are what the bytes mean, so that the kernel
//! driver is a `write_volatile` and a poll and the arithmetic is proved on the host.
//!
//! **QEMU spells this interface `fw_cfg`**, and so do Linux (`drivers/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg.c`),
//! EDK2 and U-Boot. This tree spells crate names out, so it is `firmware_configuration` here; the
//! `Cargo.toml` above records the refusals. A reader arriving from QEMU's `docs/specs/fw_cfg.rst`
//! is in the right place.
//!
//! # Why the DMA interface and not the port pair
//!
//! `fw_cfg` has two access methods. The old one selects a key by a 16-bit write and then reads the
//! data register a byte at a time; the DMA one hands the device a descriptor naming a buffer and a
//! length. **Only the DMA interface can write**, and `ramfb` is a write-only file, so there is no
//! choice to make. That it is also one transaction instead of `n` byte reads is a bonus rather than
//! the reason.
//!
//! # Everything here is big-endian
//!
//! `fw_cfg` is a firmware interface that predates any of its guests agreeing on an endianness, so
//! the device fixed one: **every multi-byte field in every structure below is big-endian**,
//! including on the little-endian machines that are the only ones this tree runs on. That is the
//! single mistake this whole crate exists to make impossible, which is why every encoder here takes
//! a native value and returns bytes rather than a struct anybody could `transmute`.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Point a `ramfb` at a framebuffer the guest owns. The configuration is 28 bytes and the command
//! that delivers them is 16, and both are what the device reads:
//!
//! ```
//! use firmware_configuration::{DmaCommand, RamFramebuffer};
//! use machine_discovery::framebuffer::{Framebuffer, PixelOrder};
//!
//! let screen = Framebuffer {
//!     base: 0x4020_0000,
//!     width: 800,
//!     height: 600,
//!     stride: 3200,
//!     order: PixelOrder::Bgrx,
//! };
//!
//! let config = RamFramebuffer(screen).encode();
//! // The address leads, big-endian, and the format is DRM's `XR24` spelled as four ASCII bytes.
//! assert_eq!(&config[..8], &0x4020_0000u64.to_be_bytes());
//! assert_eq!(&config[8..12], b"\x34\x32\x52\x58");
//!
//! // Selecting the file and writing those 28 bytes is one command.
//! let command = DmaCommand::write(0x0021, config.len() as u32, 0x4000_1000).encode();
//! assert_eq!(&command[..4], &0x0021_0018u32.to_be_bytes());
//! ```
//!
//! Finding the key to select means walking the file directory the device publishes at a fixed key:
//!
//! ```
//! use firmware_configuration::{DirectoryEntry, ENTRY_LEN, RAMFB};
//!
//! let mut entry = [0u8; ENTRY_LEN];
//! entry[..4].copy_from_slice(&28u32.to_be_bytes());
//! entry[4..6].copy_from_slice(&0x0021u16.to_be_bytes());
//! entry[8..8 + RAMFB.len()].copy_from_slice(RAMFB);
//!
//! let parsed = DirectoryEntry::parse(&entry).expect("a well-formed entry");
//! assert_eq!(parsed.size, 28);
//! assert_eq!(parsed.select, 0x0021);
//! assert!(parsed.is(RAMFB));
//! ```
//!
//! Name: provisional, coined by milestone 243's lane on 2026-09-19, unrecorded (calef has not ruled
//! on it). QEMU, Linux, EDK2 and U-Boot all spell this interface `fw_cfg`; this tree spells crate
//! names out (`address_space_identifier`, `inter_process_communication`), and an acronym only its
//! author can expand is the failure `design/naming.md` names. The refusals: `fw_cfg` is the outside
//! world's name and is the abbreviation the convention refuses; `qemu_firmware_config` puts a vendor
//! in the name of an interface other emulators also implement, and abbreviates anyway;
//! `firmware_config` splits the difference and still abbreviates.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Nothing here checks that the device is real.** A machine with no `fw_cfg` node in its device
//!   tree never gets this far, and a machine whose node points somewhere else would have these
//!   structures written into whatever is there. The trust boundary is the device tree, which is the
//!   same boundary the UART and the interrupt controller already sit on.
//! - **The directory is walked, not indexed.** `ramfb`'s key is not architecturally fixed (QEMU
//!   assigns file keys in the order the files are added, so it moves when another device is
//!   attached), so the only correct way to find it is the walk, and the walk is `O(files)` reads
//!   over a DMA interface. It happens once per boot.
//! - **`ramfb` is QEMU's**, not a standard. Real silicon has no such device, which is why the
//!   milestone that added this says plainly that the boards' answer is milestone 157's U-Boot
//!   `simple-framebuffer` handoff and this is what the emulator can do in the meantime.
