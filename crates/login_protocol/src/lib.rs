#![no_std]
//! **The wire contract between a client and the login service** (milestone 49's login half).
//!
//! Unix login authenticates and then mutates a global identity field. This contract is the other
//! shape: a client presents an identity and a secret, and on success the service delegates a fresh
//! **capability set** back over the same channel rather than changing anything ambient. See
//! `components/src/login.rs` for the service and notes/login.md for the design.
//!
//! # The exchange
//!
//! Not a `CALL`: a one-shot reply capability carries two words and nothing else (`abi::reply`), and
//! a successful login has to hand back capabilities, which only `abi::rendezvous::SEND_CAP` can do.
//! So this is two persistent endpoints and a fixed message order, the same shape
//! `grant_plan::spawnproto` already uses for exactly this reason (a shell's spawn request that may
//! carry a delegated budget).
//!
//! **Two phases, not one, since milestone 49's channel-per-client update.** `REQUEST`/`RESULT` (the
//! endpoints every client is handed at spawn) are a **front door**, shared by every client this
//! service will ever see, for the width of exactly one message each: a bare [`CONNECT`], answered
//! with a fresh, private [`CONNECTED`] channel. The identity and secret an actual login needs never
//! touch the front door at all, which is what removes the hazard the front door used to carry (see
//! this service's BUGS, "One client at a time", for what that hazard was and why a shared front door
//! carrying only [`CONNECT`] does not reintroduce it):
//!
//! ```text
//!   client --send(REQUEST, connect_word(), 0, 0)------------------------> login
//!   client <----------------- recv(RESULT) -> CONNECTED ---------------- login
//!   client <---- RECV_CAP(RESULT) x 3: priv_request, priv_result, page - login
//!
//!   client --place(), send(priv_request, w0, 0, 0)-----------------------> login
//!   client <----------------- recv(priv_result) -> OK, DENIED or -------- login
//!                                                   NO_TERMINAL
//!   client <---- RECV_CAP(priv_result) x 5, only after OK ---------------  login
//!
//!   client --send(REQUEST, logout_word(), 0, 0)---------------------------> login
//!   client <----------------- recv(RESULT) -> LOGGED_OUT ----------------- login
//! ```
//!
//! [`CONNECT`] carries no page: there is nothing in it a client did not already know, so the front
//! door never maps or reads a shared staging page at all, and two clients racing to connect can only
//! ever contend for two harmless, empty, freshly-minted objects, never for each other's identity or
//! secret. Login answers [`CONNECT`]s one at a time (this process has one thread and no wait-any
//! primitive), but that is service order, not shared state: each answer is a private key handed to
//! exactly one holder before login goes on to serve the actual login it just enabled.
//!
//! **[`LOGOUT`] travels on the front door itself, not on a private channel** (milestone 49's
//! terminal update): unlike [`CONNECT`], it carries no secret and needs no private staging, so
//! there is nothing a shared front door would expose by handling it directly. See
//! [`logout_word`] and this contract's own BUGS for what it does and does not authenticate.
//!
//! On [`OK`], login sends five capabilities over `priv_result`, or six when the reply's second word
//! carries [`RUN_UNVOUCHED_FOLLOWS`], in this order:
//!
//! 1. the **directory** capability: a freshly built `fs_subtree_caretaker`'s endpoint, `WRITE`;
//! 2. the **filesystem's shared page**, a `PageFrame`, `READ | WRITE`: the client maps it itself
//!    (`user_mode_runtime::map_page_frame`) at whatever address it chooses, and uses it for both the request it
//!    stages to the directory endpoint and the caretaker's own hop to the file service, which is
//!    sound for the reason `crates/system_initializer` gives (`fs_subtree_caretaker` and its client
//!    share one frame because every request on both hops is a blocking `CALL`);
//! 3. the **budget**: a `MemoryRegion`, `WRITE | GRANT`, freshly split so the client's memory is
//!    genuinely its own and it may in turn split, spend, or hand pieces of it on. `WRITE` is also
//!    what `MemoryRegion::DESTROY` needs, so this capability doubles as its own reclaim: a client that
//!    calls `DESTROY` on it, alongside the fourth capability below, gives back everything a session
//!    spent rather than only the caretaker's half;
//! 4. the **logout ticket**: a `MemoryRegion`, `WRITE` only, the exact region the directory capability's
//!    caretaker was built from (`components/src/login.rs`'s `mint`, see that program's module docs,
//!    "Reclaiming a session"). It has nothing left to `SPLIT` or `RETYPE` (its whole budget went
//!    into building the caretaker), so its only remaining use is `invoke(cap, abi::memory_region::DESTROY,
//!    0, 0, 0)`, which reclaims the caretaker's TCB, address space and endpoint and returns the
//!    pages to `login`'s own construction budget. **A client should retry `DESTROY` a bounded few
//!    times on refusal rather than treat one attempt as final**: the caretaker can be transiently
//!    mid-request to the file service when a logout arrives, which refuses the very first `DESTROY`
//!    (the same shape `crates/system_initializer::reclaim` already retries for a directory grant's
//!    own caretaker); it never refuses permanently, because the caretaker's own client-facing
//!    endpoint is retyped from this same region, so its steady state (parked in `recv` between
//!    requests) is always reclaimable, never the permanently-blocked case
//!    `notes/hung-component.md` documents as unfixable. Logging out is optional: a client that never
//!    calls `DESTROY` costs `login` exactly what it always cost (see that program's BUGS on
//!    `CONSTRUCTION_UT` exhaustion), this ticket just makes not costing it possible.
//! 5. **the terminal** (milestone 49's terminal update, DECISIONS-recommended "deny cleanly" shape,
//!    `design/roadmap/49-users-and-attribution.md`'s own BUGS): a `Rendezvous`, `WRITE` only, the
//!    same right the interactive boot's shell already holds on it. **Only ever present because it
//!    could be**: `login`'s own `serve_login` refuses with [`NO_TERMINAL`] before authentication is
//!    even attempted while another session already holds it, so every `OK` this contract answers
//!    carries this fifth capability too. There is exactly one physical terminal and exactly one
//!    holder at a time; see this contract's own BUGS and `components/src/login.rs`'s module docs for the
//!    single-session design this is deliberately not more than.
//! 6. **the run-unvouched capability**, only when [`OK`]'s second word says so (DECISIONS §219 (how the shell names an installed program to the spawner)
//!    gate D2, milestone 198 (a package manager) rung 3a): a `Rendezvous`, `WRITE` only, the one the progenitor
//!    receives on. A session that holds it may run bytes nobody vouched for, with only what it
//!    delegates and the clock and configuration pages; a session that was not given it cannot, and
//!    that is how a machine can have users who may not run new native code (calef's consequence in
//!    §219). No `GRANT`, so the session cannot hand it on, and for the same reason it cannot ride a
//!    `SEND_CAP` anywhere: it is used by sending on it (`grant_plan::spawnproto::
//!    RUN_UNVOUCHED_BIT`). `login` gives it only to an identity on the owner's list,
//!    [`RUN_UNVOUCHED_LIST`] (DECISIONS §221 (the boot prompt is the owner's console)), and only
//!    when it holds one itself.
//!
//! **A full logout destroys capability 3 before capability 4, and the order is load-bearing.**
//! `mint()` splits the fourth capability's region from `login`'s own `CONSTRUCTION_UT` first and the
//! third capability's budget second, so the budget sits above the region in `CONSTRUCTION_UT`'s
//! watermark. `crates/regions`' own reclaim only returns a freed child's pages to a reusable state
//! when it is the *top* of its parent's watermark (LIFO, the same rule §16's object revocation and
//! `job_undertaker`'s pool already live under, and DECISIONS §92 already named for a caretaker's own
//! region); destroying the region first, while the budget above it is still alive, still reclaims the
//! caretaker's TCB, address space and endpoint (`DESTROY` still returns success), but leaves its
//! pages a stranded hole that does not come back to `login`'s reusable capacity until
//! `CONSTRUCTION_UT` itself is destroyed. Destroy the budget first, then the region, and both spans
//! return cleanly. **This is a property of this specific pair, not a general promise**: it holds
//! regardless of what any other client does, because nothing else is ever split from
//! `CONSTRUCTION_UT` *between* one login's own two capabilities (`mint()` builds both, back to back,
//! before either is delegated); it does not extend to reclaiming *two different logins'* memory out
//! of the order they were minted in, which needs the same LIFO discipline this tree already accepts
//! elsewhere.
//!
//! On [`DENIED`], [`MALFORMED`] or [`NO_TERMINAL`], nothing follows: the client holds exactly what
//! it held before it asked.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **Which identities get the run-unvouched capability is a file the owner writes**
//! ([`RUN_UNVOUCHED_LIST`], DECISIONS §221 (the boot prompt is the owner's console), ruling 2).
//! It is read on every login, so an owner's edit holds from the next login on, and it shares the
//! file service's one page with every session: sound only while the terminal rule keeps one
//! session live at a time, which is the assumption every client of that page already makes. No
//! session `login` builds can spawn anything today (none holds a spawn endpoint), so a listed
//! session's capability is delivered and not yet usable; the boot prompt is the only session that
//! presents it. Taking a name off the list holds from that identity's next login; a session
//! already built keeps its copy, because nothing revokes a delegated capability here.
//!
//! **[`LOGOUT`] authenticates nothing.** It is a bare word on the shared front door, deliberately:
//! unlike a login it carries no secret to protect and needs no private channel, but the flip side is
//! that any process holding the front-door request endpoint (every client this service will ever
//! see, by construction)
//! can free the terminal out from under whoever is using it. That is a real, unauthenticated
//! interruption a hostile co-tenant could perform, not merely a discourtesy; it is accepted here
//! because today's actual deployment is one interactive boot with one physical terminal and no
//! untrusted co-tenant reaching this endpoint at all, which is exactly the scope
//! `design/roadmap/49-users-and-attribution.md`'s own terminal BUGS entry names as this slice's
//! bound. A deployment that must defend against a hostile holder of `REQUEST` needs `LOGOUT` to
//! carry proof (the identity that is logging out, or better, a capability only that session holds),
//! which is real work this slice does not build.
//!
//! **A stale terminal handoff has no automatic recovery.** If the process holding the terminal
//! capability exits, crashes, or simply never calls [`logout_word`], `login`'s own `terminal_held`
//! flag stays set forever and every later login is refused `NO_TERMINAL`, indistinguishably from a
//! session that is genuinely still in use. There is no liveness check on the holder (this tree's
//! usual "no wait-any primitive" bound: `login` cannot watch its client and also keep serving new
//! connections), so recovering from an abandoned session today means restarting `login` itself. See
//! `components/src/login.rs`'s own BUGS for the same limitation stated at the component a reader meets
//! first.
//!
//! # The request page
//!
//! Identical in shape to [`credential_protocol`]'s: an identity and a secret, because this service's whole
//! first act is relaying the presented pair to the credential service's own `VERIFY` unchanged. Its
//! `place`/`read`/`req`/`op` do not encode anything specific to that service's own semantics (`op`
//! is a caller-supplied word), so this contract reuses them rather than defining a second copy of
//! the same layout and risking the two drifting the way `credentialer.rs`'s own compile-time
//! assertions exist to catch for `cred`/`credential_protocol`.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review). Minted 2026-08-22
//! for milestone 49, following the tree's existing `<subject>_proto` pattern (`credential_proto`,
//! `clock_proto`, `entropy_proto`), which is what those three were called that day.
//!
//! **The suffix became `_protocol` at milestone 265** (calef, 2026-09-05). The stem was left open
//! then, because calef had parked the whole `login` family on 2026-09-14, and 265 accepted that it
//! might cost this crate a second rename. **It will not: calef ruled on 2026-09-15 that the stem stays
//! for the whole family**, so this name is final on both halves. The argument is in
//! `design/naming/vocabulary-rulings.md`, "The `login` stem stays".
