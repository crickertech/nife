//! An ELF64 loader's front half: parse, validate, and hand back the segments to map.
//!
//! **Pure logic, so it compiles for the host and its tests run in milliseconds** with no
//! emulator (DECISIONS.md §7). Nothing in here knows what a page table is. It answers one
//! question: *what does this file want me to put where, and with what permissions?*
//!
//! Deliberately narrow. We parse **static, little-endian, aarch64, `ET_EXEC`** binaries and
//! nothing else. No dynamic linking, no relocations, no interpreter, no PIE. Every one of those
//! is a real feature and every one of them is also a way for a file to ask us to do something
//! surprising, and we would rather say "no" in eleven lines than "maybe" in a thousand.
//!
//! See notes/elf.md.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Forging an ELF64 image by hand is twenty lines, and **that is the argument for this crate being a
//! host crate rather than kernel code.** Writing a malicious binary costs nothing here; producing one
//! from a real toolchain, getting it into an initrd, and booting QEMU to watch it be refused would be
//! a day's work and a slower test.
