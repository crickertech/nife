#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]
//! **The `StarFive` JH7110 TRNG, as pure logic** (milestone 159; roadmap
//! `design/roadmap/159-jh7110-trng-driver.md`, notes/entropy.md).
//!
//! The register layout, the DTB query that finds the device, and the decision of whether a
//! generation attempt succeeded, failed, or is still running, with nothing an actual driver
//! touches. The controller's register file is the future driver's (`kernel/src/user/`-side or
//! `components/src/`-side, not yet written; see the roadmap doc's "What was deliberately not
//! built"),
//! the same split `pci` and `non_volatile_memory_express` already use (AGENTS.md rule 7): this crate is host-testable
//! and Kani-reachable precisely because it never dereferences a pointer.
//!
//! # This has not run against real silicon
//!
//! **Nothing in this crate has been verified against the JH7110's TRNG on real hardware.** Every
//! fact below is sourced from documentation, not measurement; the roadmap doc's gate is HARDWARE
//! for exactly this reason, and this file does not change that. What is proven is proven on the
//! host, against values this crate makes up or a hand-written device-tree fixture, never against a
//! live register.
//!
//! # Sources
//!
//! - **[binding]** Linux, `Documentation/devicetree/bindings/rng/starfive,jh7110-trng.yaml`,
//!   mainline as of 2026-08-24 (fetched via
//!   `raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/master/...`). Gives the compatible string, the
//!   `reg` window, the two clock inputs (`hclk`, `ahb`), one reset line, one interrupt, and the
//!   worked example this crate's DTB fixture is modeled on:
//!   `rng@1600C000 { reg = <0x1600C000 0x4000>; interrupts = <30>; }`.
//! - **[driver]** Linux, `drivers/char/hw_random/jh7110-trng.c`, mainline as of 2026-08-24,
//!   fetched the same way. The register offsets and bit positions below are transcribed from it;
//!   see each constant's doc for what the driver does with it. This is "the strongest grounding
//!   available without hardware" the milestone's brief asked for: a real, shipped, working Linux
//!   driver's register sequence, not a guess from the block diagram.
//! - **[ds]** `StarFive`, *JH7110 Datasheet*, v1.67 (2025-02-14),
//!   `doc-en.rvspace.org/JH7110/PDF/JH7110_DS.pdf`, §2.8.2 "TRNG", fetched and extracted with
//!   `pdftotext -layout` on 2026-08-24 (the `RVspace` TLS certificate had expired by then; a mirror
//!   at `elecrow.com/download/product/DTN63002G/JH7110_Datasheet.pdf` served the same PDF). Quoted
//!   in full because it is short and it is the compliance claim (or its absence) this crate's
//!   health-test story rests on:
//!
//!   > The TRNG module of JH7110 provides the following features.
//!   > - Ring-oscillator based entropy source
//!   > - Support LFSR based digital post process
//!   > - Support self re-seeding
//!   > - 256-bit random number generation
//!
//!   That is the entire section. **No NIST SP 800-90B, FIPS 140, or AIS-31 claim appears anywhere
//!   in the datasheet the search above could reach.** See "Health testing" below.
//!
//! - **[trm]** `StarFive`, *JH7110 Technical Reference Manual*, Preliminary V2 (2023-04-24, Doc ID
//!   `JH7110-TRMEN-001`), "TRNG > Control Registers",
//!   `doc-en.rvspace.org/JH7110/TRM/JH7110_TRM/control_registers_trng.html`, fetched 2026-09-04.
//!   **This is the register documentation the first two lanes did not have**, and it is what
//!   settles three things they had to record as unknown: `ISTAT` is `R/W1C`, `AUTO_RQSTS` and
//!   `AUTO_AGE` are disabled by writing zero, and `MODE.R256` decides whether the answer is four
//!   words or eight. It also names two `ISTAT` bits no Linux driver defines (`AGE_ALARM`,
//!   `RQST_ALARM`) and one `STAT` field worth knowing about, `LAST_RESEED`, whose value `0x7`
//!   means "Unseeded (zeroized state)". The register map it gives is `CTRL` 0x00, `STAT` 0x04,
//!   `MODE` 0x08, `SMODE` 0x0C, `IE` 0x10, `ISTAT` 0x14, `FEATURES` 0x1C, `RAND0..7` 0x20..0x3C,
//!   `SEED0..7` 0x40..0x5C, `AUTO_RQSTS` 0x60, `AUTO_AGE` 0x64, `BUILD_CONFIG` 0x68, which agrees
//!   with [driver] everywhere the two overlap. **Caveat, stated because it changes what can be
//!   claimed**: the bit *positions* live in the page's figures, which are images, so the numbering
//!   in this file comes from [driver] and [netbsd] and the TRM supplies the names and meanings.
//! - **[netbsd]** `NetBSD`, `sys/arch/riscv/starfive/jh7110_trng.c`, `$NetBSD: jh7110_trng.c,v 1.2
//!   2025/02/09 09:09:49 skrll Exp $`, fetched 2026-09-04 from
//!   `raw.githubusercontent.com/NetBSD/src/trunk/sys/arch/riscv/starfive/jh7110_trng.c`. A third,
//!   independent driver for the same block, and the most useful one here because **it is the only
//!   one that polls**. It supplies the bit positions mainline omits
//!   (`IENABLE`/`ISTATUS`: `RAND_RDY` 0, `SEED_DONE` 1, `AGE_ALARM` 2, `RQST_LOCKUP` 3,
//!   `LFSR_LOCKUP` 4, `GLOBAL` 31) and it is the source of the `SEEDED` gate this crate now
//!   applies: its poll path reads `STAT` and only trusts `ISTAT.RAND_RDY` when `STAT.SEEDED` is
//!   set, issuing a random reseed when it is not.
//!
//! # The register file [driver]
//!
//! Eight registers wide, `CTRL` through `ISTAT`, then eight 32-bit output words. All offsets and
//! bit positions are [regs] and the `*_` constants below, transcribed from `jh7110-trng.c`'s own
//! `#define`s and cross-checked against [trm]'s register map and [netbsd]'s.
//!
//! # The bring-up order, and what each step is for
//!
//! **All three drivers agree on this sequence**, which is worth saying because the agreement is
//! the evidence: [driver]'s `starfive_trng_init`, the vendor driver's function of the same name,
//! and [netbsd]'s `jh7110_trng_init` were written by three sets of people against one IP block.
//! A driver that skips a step is not being minimal, it is relying on a reset value nobody
//! documented.
//!
//! 1. **Disable the reseed alarms**: write 0 to `AUTO_AGE` and `AUTO_RQSTS` ([regs]). [driver]
//!    does this first, from module parameters that default to 0. Skipping it leaves whatever the
//!    block reset to, and a nonzero counter raises [`ISTAT_AGE_ALARM`] or [`ISTAT_RQST_ALARM`]
//!    later, in a register a driver may not be decoding.
//! 2. **Clear `ISTAT`**, write-1-to-clear, [`ISTAT_ALL`]. This is the step whose absence is
//!    invisible until the second generation: `RAND_RDY` is latched, so a driver that never
//!    acknowledges it sees "ready" instantly on every request after the first, and reads the
//!    `RAND` words without waiting for the device to refill them.
//! 3. **Select the output width**: write [`MODE_R256`] into `MODE`. [netbsd] writes it
//!    unconditionally; [driver] writes it and otherwise clamps its read to four words. A driver
//!    that assembles eight words without having set this is claiming 32 bytes from a block that
//!    may only have answered with 16.
//! 4. **Interrupts, or deliberately not.** [driver] and [netbsd] enable the `IE` contributions
//!    because they are interrupt-driven. A polling driver leaves `IE` at zero; see
//!    [`IE_GLBL_EN`] for the measurement that says `ISTAT` latches anyway.
//! 5. **Seed the core**: write [`CTRL_EXEC_RANDRESEED`] and wait for [`ISTAT_SEED_DONE`], then
//!    acknowledge it. Until this completes, `STAT.SEEDED` is clear and [`interpret`] answers
//!    [`Outcome::Unseeded`] to every poll.
//!
//! Then, per generation: acknowledge any stale [`ISTAT_RAND_RDY`], write [`CTRL_GENE_RANDNUM`],
//! poll `(STAT, ISTAT)` through [`interpret`], and acknowledge `RAND_RDY` once the words are read.
//!
//! # Health testing: what the hardware gives you cheaply, and what it does not give you at all
//!
//! The brief for this milestone asked to check whether the JH7110 documents a hardware health-test
//! status register before writing any software statistical tests, because a hardware bit that is
//! merely read is nearly free and a software NIST SP 800-90B suite (repetition-count,
//! adaptive-proportion) is real design and verification work this project should not build on
//! spec.
//!
//! The answer is a partial one. **[driver] documents exactly one hardware fault signal**:
//! `ISTAT.LFSR_LOCKUP` (bit 4), which the Linux driver's interrupt handler treats as "SEU
//! [single-event upset] occurred, reseeding required" and answers by re-issuing
//! `CTRL.EXEC_RANDRESEED`. That is cheap (a status bit, already read every poll) and this crate
//! surfaces it: [`interpret`] returns [`Outcome::Lockup`] rather than folding it into "not ready
//! yet", so a caller can count it, retry it, or refuse to serve bytes past it, the same shape
//! `entropy.rs`'s `NO_ENTROPY` already gives a dry virtio-rng device.
//!
//! **What the hardware does *not* give you** is any statistical claim about the bits it is not
//! actively refusing. `LFSR_LOCKUP` catches a specific failure mode (the digital post-processing
//! stage getting stuck), not a degraded-but-still-running ring oscillator, and neither [ds] nor
//! [driver] document a built-in SP 800-90B-class test. Whether *this project* needs one before
//! trusting these bytes for anything security-shaped is a real design question the datasheet does
//! not resolve, and it is exactly the "open-ended judgment about cryptographic soundness" this
//! milestone's brief said to write up rather than guess at. **It is not decided here.** See the
//! roadmap doc and the final report for milestone 159's lane; the honest state of the question
//! belongs in `design/decisions/` as a PROPOSED entry, which is an architect's call to write, not this
//! lane's (AGENTS.md: a developer never edits `design/`).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use jh7110_entropy::{Outcome, interpret, ISTAT_RAND_RDY, ISTAT_LFSR_LOCKUP, STAT_SEEDED};
//!
//! // Not ready: seeded, but the generation has not finished.
//! assert_eq!(interpret(STAT_SEEDED, 0, [0; 8]), Outcome::NotReady);
//!
//! // Ready: the eight output words assemble little-endian, word 0 first.
//! let rand = [0x0403_0201, 0x0807_0605, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
//! match interpret(STAT_SEEDED, ISTAT_RAND_RDY, rand) {
//!     Outcome::Ready(bytes) => assert_eq!(&bytes[..8], &[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]),
//!     other => panic!("expected Ready, got {other:?}"),
//! }
//!
//! // A latched RAND_RDY on a core that says it was never seeded is not an answer.
//! assert_eq!(interpret(0, ISTAT_RAND_RDY, rand), Outcome::Unseeded);
//!
//! // A hardware fault beats a stale RAND_RDY from the same snapshot: the driver must not read a
//! // register file mid-reseed as if it were a fresh answer.
//! assert_eq!(
//!     interpret(STAT_SEEDED, ISTAT_RAND_RDY | ISTAT_LFSR_LOCKUP, [0; 8]),
//!     Outcome::Lockup
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! # What was deliberately not built
//!
//! No unsafe register access, no capability-holding driver program, and no wiring into
//! `entropy_service`. Rule 2's "gets what it needs passed in" is honored structurally: nothing
//! here knows a physical address at all, `discover` returns one instead of assuming it, and the
//! program that will eventually hold a `DeviceFrame` capability for that address is future work.
//! See the roadmap doc for exactly what is and is not ready for a customer to pick up.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-13 (calef, working the unratified worklist), replacing
//! `jh7110_entropy_source`, which he ratified earlier the same day and superseded on a second
//! pass through the same worklist. The stem was settled then and is not reopened here: TRNG
//! expands to true random number generator, the expansion teaches, and that is the 2026-09-05
//! acronym rule which retired `jh7110_trng`. What moved is the tail. `_source` appears **nowhere
//! else in this tree**, so the crate and its program were the suffix's only two instances, and the
//! chip prefix was already doing the work it was doing: saying which of the two backends for one
//! contract this is. The peer backend, the virtio-rng one, is simply `entropy`, on milestone 63's
//! resource-name pattern of naming a service for the resource it hands you; 63 cites that pattern
//! as the one it departed from for `credentialer`, on the ground that a credential service never
//! hands you a credential, and this one does hand you entropy, so the pattern holds. The chip
//! prefix is settled precedent in the other direction too: `jh7110_clock_and_reset` was ruled in
//! the same pass, and `jh7110` stays in both, because a part number is a proper noun no expansion
//! test reaches. Refused `jh7110_entropy_driver` (it breaks the crate-and-program pair: this crate
//! is not a driver, it is the register decode, the device-tree query and the byte pool,
//! host-tested and Kani-reachable, and AGENTS.md says that shared name is worth seeing rather than
//! splitting). That one was close, because it would have joined the ratified driver family in
//! `components/`, whose own ratification wanted a reader scanning that directory to meet programs
//! that say what they drive; what disqualifies it is the half of the pair that is not a program.
//! Refused
//! `jh7110_true_random_number_generator` (35 characters, and the spec's full name buys nothing,
//! the reasoning that also gave `executable_format` its name rather than ELF's) and bare
//! `entropy_source` (this tree will have a second system on a chip, and the chip qualifier keeps
//! two drivers apart). **The argument that lost**, when the stem was decided, was the
//! external-standard exemption, that `trng` follows `nvme` and `pci` as a spec-named device; the
//! 2026-09-13 amendment to decision 113 ends that exemption for acronym crates. (`nvme` is kept
//! here because it is the spelling the argument was made in; DECISIONS §154 later deratified it
//! and the crate is `non_volatile_memory_express` now, which is that amendment arriving.) The name joins
//! `entropy` and `entropy_protocol` rather than colliding with them: the service, the wire contract,
//! and this, the hardware behind them.
