//! **The framebuffer contract** (milestone 29, the display ladder's first rung).
//!
//! Written down as code in one place so the three parties cannot drift: the display driver
//! (`user/src/display.rs`, which owns the virtio-gpu device), the client that draws
//! (`user/src/painter.rs`, which owns no device at all), and the kernel-side test that checks the
//! result. The prose contract is notes/framebuffer-contract.md; this crate is its machine-readable
//! half, the same split `fs_proto` makes for the filesystem and `line_editor::proto` for the terminal.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! ```text
//!   virtio-gpu ──virtio──►┌────────────────┐◄──display IPC──┐ client
//!    (PCIe, behind        │ display driver │                │ (holds a surface + an endpoint,
//!     the IOMMU)          └────────────────┘                │  no device, no DMA authority)
//!                              ▲     ▲
//!                              │     └── the surface: N frames of pixels, mapped in BOTH
//!                              └──────── the rings + request buffers, mapped in the DRIVER ONLY
//! ```
//!
//! **Control by message, pixels by shared frame** (DECISIONS §10), the same division the block and
//! file contracts make. A client CALLs the driver with an opcode and a rectangle; the pixels
//! themselves never ride in a message. They live in a run of frames the kernel maps into both
//! address spaces at spawn, and which the client may write at any time without asking.
//!
//! # Who can do what, and why the split is the point
//!
//! The driver holds the `Virtio` capability, the device's interrupt, and a mapping of the whole DMA
//! region. The client holds an endpoint and the surface frames, and that is all: it cannot program a
//! queue, cannot ring the device, cannot see the descriptor rings (they are in a page it is not
//! mapped), and cannot name a physical address. So the worst a hostile client can do is draw
//! nonsense, which is exactly the authority a thing that draws should have. That separation is what
//! rung two (the compositor, milestone 33) is built on, which is why it is drawn this early: the
//! compositor takes the client's place and multiplexes many surfaces into one, and it should not
//! have to invent a contract to do it.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The test pattern is the part of this contract worth demonstrating, because its whole value is
//! **negative**: it is built so that the ways a framebuffer actually fails are all visible, and a
//! solid fill would catch none of them. A buffer shifted by a single pixel is the case that a
//! checksum over a fill, or a "is it all blue?" check, cannot see at all:
//!
//! ```
//! use graphics_proto::{PIXELS, checksum, expected_checksum, first_mismatch, pixel_at};
//!
//! // A client that painted the surface correctly.
//! let good: [u32; PIXELS] = core::array::from_fn(pixel_at);
//! assert_eq!(checksum(|i| good[i]), expected_checksum());
//! assert_eq!(first_mismatch(|i| good[i]), None);
//!
//! // The same pixels, off by one: a stride bug, or a driver that transferred from the wrong offset.
//! let shifted: [u32; PIXELS] = core::array::from_fn(|i| pixel_at(i + 1));
//! assert_ne!(checksum(|i| shifted[i]), expected_checksum());
//! assert_eq!(first_mismatch(|i| shifted[i]), Some(0)); // and it names where
//!
//! // A device that ignored the transfer entirely.
//! assert_ne!(checksum(|_| 0), expected_checksum());
//! ```
//!
//! A damage rectangle is one word, so a flush is one message with no shared-memory preamble, and a
//! rectangle that leaves the surface is **refused rather than clamped**: a clamp would silently
//! absorb a client's coordinate bug.
//!
//! ```
//! use graphics_proto::{HEIGHT, WIDTH, rect, rect_in_surface, unrect};
//!
//! let w = rect(4, 8, 16, 32);
//! assert_eq!(unrect(w), (4, 8, 16, 32));
//! assert!(rect_in_surface(4, 8, 16, 32));
//!
//! assert!(!rect_in_surface(0, 0, WIDTH + 1, HEIGHT)); // one pixel too wide
//! assert!(!rect_in_surface(0, 0, WIDTH, 0)); // empty is not a flush
//! ```
//!
//! # What deliberately is NOT here
//!
//! No fonts, no glyph cache, no VT state, no input. Rung one puts pixels in a scanout and proves
//! they got there; the terminal on top is a later increment and slots in as another client of this
//! same contract (see notes/framebuffer-contract.md, "The seams left open").
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review). Renamed from
//! `gfx_proto`: spell out the `gfx` abbreviation fully, matching the pattern from
//! `cred_proto` -> `credential_proto` and `env_proto` -> `environment_proto` in a parallel lane.
//! `gfx_proto` was one of two `*_proto` crates whose name was unrecorded (introduced 2026-07-29
//! with virtio-gpu enumeration); `gfx` was an abbreviation, which is the first of the three
//! failure modes the naming tenet lists for crate names, and `graphics` is the word its seven
//! siblings' rule was already missing a decision on.
