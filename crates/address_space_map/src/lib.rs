//! **The user address-space map**: which band of a process's low half holds what.
//!
//! Name: provisional. Introduced 2026-09-26 by milestone 206 (a program image has under 896 KiB),
//! which built DECISIONS §171 (where a program image starts) option D as calef ruled it that day.
//! `address_space_map` says what the crate is, a map of one address space, and the `_map` suffix is
//! the noun a reader reaches for when asking "where does this page go". `user_layout` was
//! considered and set aside because `layout` already means struct layout in this tree (every
//! `*_protocol` crate has one). `address_space` alone would read as the kernel object of that name.
//! The bands, the functions and the error below are named inside the same provisional scope.
//!
//! # The map
//!
//! Every address here is a user virtual address, the same on all three architectures.
//!
//! ```text
//!   band              start         end           size       what goes in it
//!   NULL_GUARD        0x0000_0000   0x0020_0000     2 MiB    nothing, ever
//!   PAIR_PAGES        0x0020_0000   0x1000_0000   254 MiB    pages one builder agrees with the one program it builds
//!   RUNTIME_WINDOWS   0x1000_0000   0x4000_0000   768 MiB    windows a loader or runtime places for a program
//!   HEAP              0x4000_0000   0x5000_0000   256 MiB    the heap, and nothing else
//!   SERVICE_WINDOWS   0x5000_0000   0x6000_0000   256 MiB    large shared windows a service contract names
//!   IMAGE             0x6000_0000   0x7F00_0000   496 MiB    the program's own ELF segments
//!   STACK             0x7F00_0000   0x7FFF_0000   ~16 MiB    the stack, growing down from STACK_TOP
//!   PROCESS_PAGES     0x7FFF_0000   0x8000_0000    64 KiB    per-process pages the kernel maps (current CPU)
//! ```
//!
//! The bands tile `[0, 2 GiB)` with no gap, and a host test below holds them to that. Above 2 GiB
//! is unassigned except for one page: the timebase page (`counter_frequency_protocol::PAGE_VA`),
//! which predates this map and sits at seven-eighths of each architecture's low half. It pins
//! itself against [`CODE_MODEL_CEILING`] in its own tests.
//!
//! # Which band a new page belongs in
//!
//! Ask these in order and stop at the first yes.
//!
//! 1. **Is it the program's code or data?** [`IMAGE`]. For a loaded program the linker script put
//!    it there; a child built from parts by hand (a benchmark's stub, a supervision test's) puts its
//!    code page at [`IMAGE_BASE`] too, so its page tables have the shape a real program's do.
//!    Nothing else may map in that band.
//! 2. **Is it the stack?** [`STACK`], mapped down from [`STACK_TOP_PAGE`], by a loader or by hand.
//! 3. **Does the kernel map it into every process, unasked?** [`PROCESS_PAGES`], beside the stack,
//!    so it shares the stack's page tables and costs one leaf rather than three tables. The current
//!    CPU page is here.
//! 4. **Is it the heap?** [`HEAP`].
//! 5. **Is it mapped by a loader or a runtime into programs that did not choose the address**: a
//!    page std's loader hands every std program, the initrd window, a builder's own scratch cursor,
//!    std's per-socket frames? [`RUNTIME_WINDOWS`], sited with a written argument in the protocol
//!    crate that owns it, the way `std_runtime_protocol` sites its three pages.
//! 6. **Is it a large window a service contract names**, shared by several programs that speak one
//!    protocol (the block channel at `0x5000_0000`, a screen aperture)? [`SERVICE_WINDOWS`].
//! 7. **Otherwise it is a pair page**: one builder and the one program it builds agree on it, both
//!    written knowing each other (a harness and its fixture, the progenitor and a native child's
//!    clock page). [`PAIR_PAGES`]. A program's own private windows, which nobody else knows about,
//!    go here too. **Pairs reuse addresses freely**,
//!    because two pairs never share an address space; the only thing a pair page must avoid is the
//!    other bands, and that is what [`pair_page`] checks at compile time.
//!
//! The collision that motivated this list is recorded in `counter_frequency_protocol`: a page the
//! kernel mapped into every process was first placed at `0x60_0000`, which is a pair page for
//! `fixtures/src/window.rs`. Under this map that page answers yes at question 3 and could never have
//! been placed among pair pages.
//!
//! # Why these numbers
//!
//! - **The image band ends at 2 GiB because `x86_64` needs it to.** `targets/x86_64-unknown-nife.json`
//!   builds with `code-model: small` and `relocation-model: static`, which promises LLVM that every
//!   symbol's address fits in a sign-extended 32-bit immediate, so a static image must end at or
//!   below `0x8000_0000`. `riscv64`'s `medium` model and `aarch64`'s `small` are PC-relative and
//!   would accept more, but a layout that differs per architecture is one more thing to be wrong
//!   about, and parity is a gate here. [`CODE_MODEL_CEILING`] names the constraint.
//! - **The image band starts at `0x6000_0000` because that is the first address past everything the
//!   tree already sited.** The heap has been at `0x4000_0000` with a 256 MiB cap since milestone
//!   27, and the block channel at `0x5000_0000` since milestone 138 (close the read gap). Moving either would change a
//!   number std's PAL carries, for no gain.
//! - **The stack sits directly above the image**, so the one limit on an image's size is the
//!   stack's base, and a loader refusing an image can say exactly that. The lowest page of
//!   [`STACK`] is never mapped (see [`MAX_STACK_PAGES`]), so a stack grown to its limit faults
//!   before it touches the top of a maximal image.
//! - **The stack band is 16 MiB less the process pages.** The deepest stack in the tree today is
//!   std's 32 pages (128 KiB); Linux gives a main thread 8 MiB by default. 16 MiB holds that twice
//!   and costs nothing, because an unmapped page of address space is free.
//! - **The process pages share the stack's 2 MiB table.** `notes/benchmarks/spawn-el0.md`
//!   measured the current-CPU page at 1,245 ticks per spawn when it needed three fresh tables and
//!   741 when it needed one. With the image and the stack in the second gigabyte, the first
//!   gigabyte's tables are no longer paid for by every process, so the page moves to where they are.
//!
//! # The ceiling, before and after
//!
//! Before: a program image had **896 KiB** (`0x40_0000` up to the std stack pages below
//! `0x50_0000`). After: **496 MiB**, [`IMAGE`]'s whole width. `ripgrep`'s image spans 2.61 MiB
//! (`notes/ripgrep-on-nife.md`, measured by milestone 121 (ripgrep on nife)), so it fits 190 times over.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use address_space_map::{check_image, pair_page, ImagePlacement, IMAGE, STACK};
//!
//! // A fixture's shared page is a pair page, checked at compile time.
//! const CTL_VA: u64 = pair_page(0x60_0000);
//! assert_eq!(CTL_VA, 0x60_0000);
//!
//! // An image that fits is placed; one that runs into the stack is told so, in those words.
//! assert!(check_image(IMAGE.start, IMAGE.start + 0x29_c000).is_ok());
//! let e = check_image(IMAGE.start, IMAGE.end + 0x1000).unwrap_err();
//! assert_eq!(e, ImagePlacement::TooLarge { image_end: IMAGE.end + 0x1000, stack_base: STACK.start });
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The pair band is checked for membership, not for collisions within one process.** Two pair
//!   pages a single program maps may still land on each other; [`pair_page`] cannot see the other
//!   one. The existing fixtures that map several windows carry their own disjointness asserts
//!   (`components/src/swish.rs` is the model). A per-program list is the next rung if this bites.
//! - **`std_runtime_protocol` and `counter_frequency_protocol` restate their numbers rather than
//!   deriving them from here.** Both are generated verbatim into std's PAL by `cargo xtask std-src`,
//!   where there is no crate to name, so each pins itself to this map with a dev-dependency test
//!   instead, the precedent `byte_sink_protocol` set for `abi`. That is rung two, not rung one.
//! - **The builder's scratch cursor in [`RUNTIME_WINDOWS`] is unbounded.** `supervision_protocol`
//!   advances one page per page it builds and never unmaps, so a long-lived builder walks upward
//!   through the band. The progenitor's cursor starts at `0x1000_0000` and its initrd window is at
//!   `0x2000_0000`, so after 256 MiB of built pages the cursor reaches it and every later build
//!   fails as already mapped. A program the size of `ripgrep` costs 2.6 MiB a spawn. Bounding the
//!   cursor needs an unmap the builder does not have.
//! - **The kernel-built harness processes do not call [`check_image`] with a sentence to print**:
//!   the userspace loader (`supervision_protocol`) returns `Err(())` for every refusal, so a
//!   too-large image built by a userspace builder is still reported as "could not spawn".
