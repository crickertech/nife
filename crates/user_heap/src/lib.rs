//! **`user_heap`**: the userspace heap algorithm, as pure logic (milestone 27).
//!
//! A first-fit, address-sorted free list with coalescing, the same shape the kernel's original
//! milestone-4 heap had (notes/heap.md) and for the same reason: zero overhead on allocated
//! memory. `GlobalAlloc::dealloc` receives the `Layout` back, so no per-allocation header is
//! needed; the free-list node lives *inside* free memory, and allocated bytes are all payload.
//!
//! This crate is deliberately just the algorithm: it manages address ranges someone else hands it
//! (`add_region`) and never maps a page or makes a syscall. The syscall half (growing the heap out
//! of the process's own untyped via `memory_region::MAP`) lives in `user_rt::heap`, which wraps this in
//! a lock and a grow-on-demand policy. The split is the project's standing rule: pure logic
//! compiles for the host, so these invariants are proven in milliseconds by `cargo test -p user_heap`,
//! not in QEMU.
//!
//! # The one invariant that makes it headerless
//!
//! Every block the heap ever hands out or holds free is **16-aligned with a size that is a
//! multiple of 16** (`MIN_ALIGN`, which is also `size_of::<FreeBlock>()`). `effective_size`
//! rounds every request up to that grid, and `alloc`/`dealloc` both compute it from the same
//! `Layout`, so the pair always agrees on how many bytes a pointer owns without storing it
//! anywhere. Front padding for over-aligned requests lands on the same grid, so every remainder
//! is itself a legal free block and no sliver is ever silently leaked.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The heap manages ranges someone else donates; it never maps a page. That split is what lets an
//! example run on the host at all:
//!
//! ```
//! use core::alloc::Layout;
//! use user_heap::{Heap, MIN_ALIGN, effective_size};
//!
//! // A 16-aligned arena. On a real process this would be pages mapped out of the untyped budget.
//! #[repr(align(4096))]
//! struct Arena([u8; 4096]);
//! let mut arena = Box::new(Arena([0; 4096]));
//!
//! let mut h = Heap::new();
//! // SAFETY: the arena is exclusively ours and outlives `h`.
//! unsafe { h.add_region(arena.0.as_mut_ptr(), arena.0.len()) };
//! assert_eq!(h.free_bytes(), 4096);
//! assert_eq!(h.block_count(), 1);
//!
//! let p = h.alloc(Layout::from_size_align(100, 8).unwrap()).unwrap();
//! assert!(p.as_ptr().addr().is_multiple_of(MIN_ALIGN));
//!
//! // SAFETY: `p` came from this heap with this layout, and is freed once.
//! unsafe { h.dealloc(p, Layout::from_size_align(100, 8).unwrap()) };
//!
//! // Everything freed coalesces back to one block. That is the invariant, not a nicety:
//! // without it a long-lived process fragments to death.
//! assert_eq!(h.block_count(), 1);
//! assert_eq!(h.free_bytes(), 4096);
//! ```
//!
//! Sizes round up to the 16-byte grid, which is what makes the allocator headerless: `alloc` and
//! `dealloc` both recompute the same number from the `Layout`, so nothing has to be stored.
//!
//! ```
//! use core::alloc::Layout;
//! use user_heap::{MIN_ALIGN, effective_size};
//!
//! assert_eq!(effective_size(Layout::from_size_align(1, 1).unwrap()), MIN_ALIGN);
//! assert_eq!(effective_size(Layout::from_size_align(16, 1).unwrap()), 16);
//! assert_eq!(effective_size(Layout::from_size_align(17, 1).unwrap()), 32);
//! ```
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `uheap`. Refused `uheap` (the `u` was
//! "userspace" and had to be decoded, while `user_rt` already establishes `user_` as this tree's
//! prefix for it).
