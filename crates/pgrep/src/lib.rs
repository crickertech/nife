//! **`pgrep`: a domain names its members, and that is all naming buys you** (milestone 126,
//! notes/process-view.md).
//!
//! This is the filter, lifted out of the program so it runs on the host in milliseconds;
//! `user/src/pgrep.rs` is the syscall and the two output streams. The crate and the program share a
//! name for the reason the naming tenet gives: they are one thing split at the IO boundary, as
//! `ps`, `coremark`, `line_editor` and `compositor` all are.
//!
//! # It filters; it does not walk
//!
//! The domain is walked by [`ps::collect`], which is the loop `user/src/ps.rs` runs, and this crate
//! takes the finished [`ps::Survey`]. That is deliberate rather than tidy: a second cursor walk
//! would be a second implementation of `abi::endpoint::SURVEY`'s resume protocol, and the one thing
//! worse than one walk that can be wrong is two that can disagree.
//!
//! # The demonstration is asymmetric on purpose, and the missing half is the claim
//!
//! On Unix, `pgrep` and `pkill` do the same lookup and differ only in what they do with the answer.
//! The split between them is convention: `kill(pid)` turns a **name** into an **action**, so
//! anything that can find a process can end it.
//!
//! **A domain names its members and does not act on them** (calef, 2026-08-17). So this system has
//! `pgrep` and **cannot have `pkill`**, and the reason is in the ABI rather than in a policy: a
//! survey returns a tid, a tid is a name, [`abi::tcb`] has no `DESTROY`, and killing a live child is
//! `abi::untyped::DESTROY` on the region it was built from, held by whoever spawned it (DECISIONS
//! §24's forcible `^C`). There is no path from the output of this program to authority over anything
//! it printed.
//!
//! What that costs, said plainly rather than dropped: `caps pgrep` prints a scope and **there is no
//! `caps pkill` to print beside it**, so the side-by-side comparison the milestone originally
//! promised does not exist. A reader who expects `kill` to be a program in this port will not find
//! one. The claim is stronger and the demonstration is thinner, and both halves of that are true.
//!
//! # Four answers, and telling them apart is the deliverable
//!
//! `ps` has three (a listing, an empty domain, a refusal) and this adds one: a selector that
//! **matched nothing** in a domain that really has members. On Unix these two collapse, because
//! `pgrep` prints nothing and exits 1 whether the pattern missed or the caller could not look, and
//! a monitor cannot tell "no cron running" from "you may not ask".
//!
//! | what happened | output stream | diagnostics |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | members matched | their tids, one per line | silent |
//! | the domain has members, none matched | nothing | `pgrep: none of the 3 ...` |
//! | the domain is empty | nothing | `pgrep: this domain holds no processes` |
//! | the walk was refused | nothing | `pgrep: this endpoint may be sent to, but not looked at ...` |
//!
//! The refusal wording is [`ps::Survey::complaint`]'s, reused rather than restated, so the two
//! programs cannot drift into describing the same refusal differently.
//!
//! # What the pattern is, and where it is resolved
//!
//! **Upstream `pgrep`'s pattern matches a process name, and this system has none** (`ps`'s `BUGS`:
//! there is `arg0` in `Spawn` and no display name at all). So the pattern here matches the one
//! other thing a domain honestly knows about a member, which is its **run state**:
//! `pgrep dead` names this domain's corpses, `pgrep 'r*'` names the ready and the running, `pgrep
//! '*'` names everything.
//!
//! The pattern never crosses a process boundary. [`Selector::from_pattern`] resolves it into a
//! [`Selector`], which is a small bitmask, and the mask is what a spawner hands the program. That
//! is the same move `rm -r` makes: the recursion flag is resolved at the prompt into the *rights*
//! the granted capability carries, so the program is handed authority rather than text. It also
//! happens to be the only option available, and that is worth saying rather than dressing up as
//! taste: see this module's `BUGS`.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! At the prompt. With no selector the answer is every member, one tid per line, which is `ps`
//! without the columns and is what pipes:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ pgrep
//! 5
//! 9
//! $ pgrep | wc          the domain, counted
//! ```
//!
//! And the answer with no Unix equivalent, because on Unix "nothing matched" and "you may not look"
//! are one output:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ pgrep               pgrep: none of the 2 processes in this domain are dead
//! $ pgrep               pgrep: this process holds no process-domain capability
//! ```
//!
//! From a host test, with no kernel and no emulator:
//!
//! ```
//! use ps::{MAX_ROWS, Row};
//!
//! // A domain of one blocked thread and one corpse.
//! let mut reader = |cursor: u64| match cursor {
//!     0 => (1, 7, abi::survey::BLOCKED),
//!     1 => (2, 9, abi::survey::DEAD),
//!     _ => (abi::survey::DONE as i64, 0, 0),
//! };
//! let mut rows = [Row::default(); MAX_ROWS];
//! let survey = ps::collect(&mut rows, &mut reader);
//!
//! let corpses = pgrep::Selector::from_pattern(b"dead");
//! let found = pgrep::select(&survey, corpses);
//! assert_eq!(found.matched(), 1);
//!
//! let mut text = Vec::new();
//! found.write_report(&mut |b| text.extend_from_slice(b));
//! assert_eq!(String::from_utf8(text).unwrap(), "9\n");
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The selector cannot be typed at the prompt, and the reason is a property of this system
//!   rather than a gap in this program.** Nothing here delivers *bytes* from a command line to a
//!   program: `grant_plan::Endowment::arg` is one `u64`, `grant_plan::spawnproto` carries three
//!   words, and every string-shaped designation on a line (a file, a directory) arrives as a
//!   **capability** instead of as text, which is what `rm logs/old` and `doc notes/glob.md` both
//!   are. So the shipped `pgrep` is `pgrep '*'`: it names every member. This is `date`'s deliberate
//!   under-declaration verbatim (`grant_plan::Prog::Date` reads three registers the shell cannot
//!   set and takes the defaults), and it lifts when `ArgSpec` grows the positional arity milestone
//!   47 deferred.
//! - **It is glob, and upstream is an extended regular expression.** `crates/glob` is proven, has a
//!   `cost_bound` nothing can blow past, and matches the shape of what is being matched here (four
//!   short names); a regex engine does not exist in this tree and importing one to match one of four
//!   words would be the dependency DECISIONS §46 declines. `pgrep 'r.*'` therefore does not mean
//!   what a `procps` user expects, and `pgrep 'r*'` does.
//! - **A pattern is matched with `glob::Dot::Ordinary`**, not the leading-dot rule `glob::matches`
//!   defaults to. A state name never begins with a dot, and the rule exists for user-facing filename
//!   listings; applying it here would be borrowing a filesystem convention for something that is
//!   not a filesystem.
//! - **There is no exit status to report with**, so "nothing matched" is a sentence on diagnostics
//!   rather than upstream's exit 1. A caller that wanted to branch on the answer would have to count
//!   the lines. `user_rt::exit` takes no code and giving it one is a syscall-surface change.
//! - **The count in "none of the N processes" is the domain as this walk saw it**, which is a
//!   sequence of snapshots (notes/process-view.md). A member born mid-walk is not in it.
//! - **The cursor is not exposed here and must not become so.** `ps`'s rows carry tids and states
//!   and nothing else, and `SURVEY`'s cursor leaks the machine's thread-table density to anyone who
//!   can subtract two of them (notes/process-view.md's `BUGS`, and a proposed milestone). This
//!   filter reads `ps::Survey`, which never held a cursor, so there is nothing here to widen.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review, confirming milestone
//! 126's own reasoning). `pgrep` is upstream's, in the group of standard terms the tenet says are
//! already right and must not be respelled; sharing it with `user/src/pgrep.rs` is the
//! crate-and-program pair the same tenet describes, as `ps` and `crates/ps` already are.
//! `Selector` is a type inside a crate rather than a
//! crate, a program or a shared module, so it is outside the tenet's scope; it is **provisional** all
//! the same, and a lane that finds a better word for it should take it.
