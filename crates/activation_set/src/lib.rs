//! **`activation_set`**: what is installed, as a table that is never edited, only succeeded.
//!
//! DECISIONS §208 (installing a package is granting it, and the activation set is versioned) ruled
//! that installing *records that a package exists*, and that **the table of entries is versioned**
//! so a set can be selected and rolled back as a whole. This crate is that table's logic, pure and
//! host-tested, for whichever process DECISIONS §219 (how the shell names an installed program to
//! the spawner) ends up giving it to. §219 gave it to the progenitor: since milestone 198 rung 3a's
//! image lane (2026-09-26) the progenitor reads the live generation on every image spawn and looks
//! the executable's digest up in it ([`lookup_digest`]).
//!
//! # Where it lives
//!
//! A directory [`DIRECTORY`] at the root of the file service, holding [`CURRENT`] and one file per
//! generation named by its decimal number ([`generation_name`]). Both the progenitor, which reads it,
//! and the host tool that seeds it for `script/swish-check` read the names from here, which is rule
//! 7: what two programs agree on is a crate. Provisional, like the crate's name: nothing on a target
//! writes a generation yet, and the installer that will is what decides who may.
//!
//! # The shape, and why it is this one
//!
//! **A generation is a text file of entries and is never rewritten.** Installing, upgrading and
//! removing each produce the *next* generation from the current one ([`with_entry`],
//! [`without_entry`]); a one-line `current` file names which generation is live
//! ([`parse_current`], [`format_current`]). So a rollback is rewriting one line to name an older
//! generation, and every older set is still on disk, whole, to be named. That is the Nix profile's
//! arrangement (a generation is immutable, the profile is a pointer), recorded as recalled rather
//! than re-read.
//!
//! **An entry is `measured_boot`'s manifest line with one column added**: `<program> <package>
//! <digest>`, where `<package>` is the package's `name-version-architecture` stem. The progenitor
//! already parses the two-column form to decide what may run, so this adds a column to a parser it
//! trusts rather than a second format on its path. §219 records this as a recommendation, not a
//! ruling.
//!
//! **Strict, because this table decides what may be spawned.** A malformed line makes the whole
//! table unreadable ([`Error::Malformed`]) rather than skipped, for `measured_boot`'s reason: a
//! table that half-parses vouches for whatever survived.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```
//! use activation_set::{Entry, lookup, with_entry, without_entry};
//!
//! let digest = [7u8; 32];
//! let uptime = Entry { program: "uptime", package: "uptime-0.1.0-aarch64", digest };
//! let mut first = [0u8; 256];
//! let n = with_entry("", &uptime, &mut first).unwrap();
//! let generation_1 = core::str::from_utf8(&first[..n]).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(lookup(generation_1, "uptime").unwrap().unwrap().package, "uptime-0.1.0-aarch64");
//!
//! let mut second = [0u8; 256];
//! let n = without_entry(generation_1, "uptime", &mut second).unwrap();
//! let generation_2 = core::str::from_utf8(&second[..n]).unwrap();
//! assert!(lookup(generation_2, "uptime").unwrap().is_none());
//! // Generation 1 is untouched, so rolling back is naming it again.
//! assert!(lookup(generation_1, "uptime").unwrap().is_some());
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Nothing collects old generations.** Every install leaves one file behind, which is what
//!   makes rollback free and is also unbounded. A retention rule (keep N, keep the last boot's) is
//!   owed before a system installs often.
//! - **A table is read whole into memory**, and its size is whatever the caller's buffer is. Forty
//!   entries fit a page.
//! - **One program per package entry.** A package with two programs is two entries naming the same
//!   package, which works and is not tested beyond that.
//! - **The `current` file is the one mutable thing**, so its write is the commit point, and nothing
//!   here makes that write atomic. On RedoxFS it is a one-line overwrite; whether a torn write of it
//!   is possible was not checked.
//!
//! Name: provisional 2026-09-24 (milestone 198 (a package manager)'s rung 3a consumer lane). §208's own phrase is
//! "activation set", which is why; `design/naming.md` is the rule and calef's the call.
