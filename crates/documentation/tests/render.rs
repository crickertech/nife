/// invented ones. Subsequence rather than equality because the renderer legitimately *adds*
/// characters (an image's `image:` marker) and legitimately *joins* what markup split
/// (`**L**inkable` is two runs in the source and one word on screen).
///
/// It runs at a terminal four thousand columns wide, because a real one truncates table cells to
/// their column width, and that is a formatting choice the BUGS section records rather than a
/// parsing failure. The number was found rather than picked: at 1000 columns this repository's
/// widest table still shrinks, which is what a documentation service's honest caveat looks like
/// from the inside.
/// **Not run under Miri, and the reason is that Miri has nothing to say about it** (milestone 238).
/// This test's subject is a corpus on disk: it opens 547 markdown files, 7.2 MB, and renders every
/// one. Under the interpreter that needs two concessions, and neither is cheap. It reads
/// `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` at run time, which Miri does not forward, so it wants
/// `-Zmiri-env-forward=CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`; and then it calls `read_dir`, which Miri's isolation
/// refuses, so it wants `-Zmiri-disable-isolation` as well, for the whole workspace run rather than
/// for this one test. The measurement that settled it: **0.74 seconds natively, and still running
/// after 12 minutes under Miri when it was killed** (2026-09-03).
///
/// What that would buy is nothing. `crates/documentation` has **no dependencies and no `unsafe`**, so the
/// rules Miri enforces (aliasing, provenance, uninitialized reads) cannot be broken by any line in
/// its call graph. The nineteen tests above it in this file exercise the same renderer on in-memory
/// input, cover every construct it parses, and do run under Miri; what this one adds is corpus
/// breadth, which is a documentation claim rather than a soundness one.
///
/// So this is the `cfg(miri)` sampling convention the other suites use (`gpt`'s corruption sweeps,
/// `glob`'s strides, `ntp_proto`'s 10^9-value sweep), taken to its limit: the sampled paths here are
