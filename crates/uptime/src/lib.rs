//! **`uptime`: how long the machine has been counting** (milestone 126,
//! design/roadmap/126-who-else-is-running.md).
//!
//! This is the program's whole logic, lifted out so it runs on the host in milliseconds;
//! `user/src/uptime.rs` is the syscall and nothing else. The crate and the program share a name,
//! the same split `ps`, `line_editor` and `compositor` already are.
//!
//! Name: provisional. `uptime` is upstream `procps`'s own name for the program this replaces
//! (`dpkg -L procps` lists `/usr/bin/uptime`), which the naming tenet calls the best name
//! available for a standard term a reader already knows. Flagged provisional anyway because this
//! program prints only elapsed time, none of upstream's load average or logged-in-user count (see
//! `BUGS`), and calef may want that difference visible in the name.
//!
//! # Where the number comes from, and why it needed no new capability
//!
//! `user/src/uptime.rs` reads `user_rt::monotonic_nanos`, the same ambient counter `date` reads
//! to compute the wall clock and `os_primitives_benchmarker` reads to time itself. It is granted to
//! **every** EL0 program, unconditionally, by `kernel/src/arch/*/timer.rs`'s `init` (`CNTKCTL_EL1`'s
//! `EL0VCTEN` bit on aarch64, the RISC-V and `x86_64` equivalents), which documents the grant as **a
//! deliberate, eyes-open exception to DECISIONS §10's no-ambient-authority rule**: a monotonic
//! counter grants no authority to *affect* anything, only to observe the passage of time, and every
//! OS that offers userspace self-timing accepts the same side channel. Since that exception already
//! exists and already covers every process, `uptime` needed no manifest field, no new capability,
//! and no wiring beyond what `worker` already has: the program that answers with nothing but a
//! number turned out to need nothing but the counter.
//!
//! This is the one member of milestone 126's "machine-wide statistics" row (`free`, `uptime`,
//! `vmstat`) that turned out to be pure wiring rather than a design fork. `free` and `vmstat` read
//! physical memory accounting the kernel keeps for itself and has no path to userspace yet
//! (`kernel/src/memory.rs`'s `stats()`); see design/roadmap/126-who-else-is-running.md's fork
//! write-up for why that is a different body of work.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```
//! use uptime::format;
//!
//! assert_eq!(format(0).as_bytes(), b"up 00:00:00\n");
//! assert_eq!(format(90 * 1_000_000_000).as_bytes(), b"up 00:01:30\n");
//! assert_eq!(format(90_000 * 1_000_000_000).as_bytes(), b"up 1 day, 01:00:00\n");
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **No load average, no logged-in-user count.** Upstream `uptime` prints both; neither concept
//!   exists here. There is no scheduler-load figure this kernel maintains (`sched.rs` tracks
//!   preemptions and per-core run queues, not a decaying load average), and "logged in" presumes a
//!   login registry this system does not keep (every shell is a program somebody spawned, not a
//!   session in a table). Printing "up" alone rather than inventing placeholders for either is
//!   DECISIONS §42's no-silent-degradation rule applied to features rather than to values: a zero
//!   would read as a real answer.
//! - **The counter's zero predates the kernel's own init by an unmeasured amount.** `CNTVCT_EL0`
//!   (and its RISC-V/`x86_64` equivalents) is a free-running hardware counter set by firmware or the
//!   VMM at reset, not by this kernel; `date`'s own module docs call it "ambient and untouched" for
//!   the same reason. So "up" here means "since the counter started counting," which is at or
//!   before kernel entry, never after. Under QEMU the gap is small and unmeasured; on real hardware
//!   it is whatever the boot ROM and firmware took. Every OS that reports uptime from a free-running
//!   counter carries the same caveat; Linux's is `CLOCK_BOOTTIME`, deliberately not the raw TSC, and
//!   this program has no equivalent kernel-boot epoch to read.
//! - **One-second resolution**, `date`'s own limitation, for the same reason: `monotonic_nanos`
//!   is exact, but there is no sub-second field in the printed format to spend it on.
