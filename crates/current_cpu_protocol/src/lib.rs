//! **A thread's own CPU, as a page rather than a crossing.**
//!
//! calef ruled on 2026-09-21 that two different questions get two different mechanisms: observing
//! *another* thread is a selector on the rendezvous surface, and a thread observing *itself* is a
//! per-thread page on the shape Linux's `rseq(2)` uses. That ruling's `design/decisions/` section
//! is on another branch and is not on `main` yet, so it is named here rather than cited; the
//! citation lands when it does. This crate is the self half: one definition of the page the kernel
//! writes the running core's id into, so the kernel (the one writer) and
//! `user_mode_runtime::current_cpu` (every reader) cannot drift on the layout or the fixed virtual
//! address (AGENTS.md rule 7).
//!
//! # Why a page and not a syscall
//!
//! The consumer that decides this is a memory allocator keeping a per-CPU cache: it asks which CPU
//! it is on **once per allocation**, which is millions of times a second. An IPC round trip in this
//! tree measures ~705 ns and a bare syscall is cheaper than that, but neither is in the same
//! decade as a load. `rseq` exists for exactly this reason, and Linux's own numbers for the move
//! from the vDSO path to a memory read were 20x on x86 and 35x on ARM.
//!
//! # Why a page and not a register, which is the question a reader asks next
//!
//! Checked against the three architectures this tree targets rather than taken from Linux's
//! experience:
//!
//! - **`aarch64`.** `MPIDR_EL1` is EL1 and above, so EL0 cannot read the core's identity at all.
//!   There is one register a kernel could abuse for this, `TPIDRRO_EL0`, which is EL1-writable and
//!   EL0-readable, and this tree does not use it for anything today. It was refused rather than
//!   overlooked: see the refusals below.
//! - **`riscv64`.** `mhartid` is M-mode. S-mode has `sscratch` and U-mode has nothing, so there is no
//!   register path at all, not even an abusable one. This is the architecture that decides it.
//! - **`x86_64`.** `RDPID`, and the older `LSL` against a GDT limit, do give ring 3 a core id, which
//!   is why the Linux vDSO's `getcpu` is an x86 story and arm64 ships no `__vdso_getcpu`.
//!
//! So a register path exists on one of three targets and half exists on a second. Architectural
//! parity is a gate here, §19 (architectural parity is a tenet),
//! and a mechanism that is a register on `x86_64` and a page on `riscv64` is two mechanisms to learn,
//! two to test and two to document, for a saving that is one load either way. The page is also the
//! shape that survives the next fact: the deciding argument in the 2026-09-21 ruling was that calef
//! expects a third and a fourth per-thread fact, and a page has room for them where a register does
//! not.
//!
//! # One writer, and it is the reader's own core
//!
//! This page's word changes while the process runs, which is the one way it differs from
//! `counter_frequency_protocol`'s page (written once at boot, then never again). The discipline that
//! makes it safe is stronger than a seqlock and needs no ordering argument beyond naming it:
//!
//! - A thread runs on exactly one core at a time, and **the core that writes this word is the core
//!   that is about to execute the thread**: the kernel writes it in `schedule()`, on the way in,
//!   on the destination core itself (and in `sched::adopt_address_space`, for a thread that gains
//!   a space while already running, which is that same write arriving late). Writer and reader are
//!   the same hardware thread, so program order does the work and there is nothing to fence.
//! - The handoff between two *successive* writers (this thread moving from one core to another) is
//!   ordered by the scheduler's own release/acquire pair on the run queue, the same pair that
//!   publishes the thread's saved context. This word rides that; it does not need its own.
//! - The store and the load are therefore **`Relaxed`**, and the counterpart is that existing
//!   release/acquire handoff rather than a fence of this crate's own. An aligned 64-bit access is
//!   single-copy-atomic on all three targets, so nothing tears.
//!
//! **A reader can be stale, inherently, and no ordering fixes that**: the thread may be migrated
//! the instruction after it reads. `rseq`'s restartable sequences are Linux's answer to that and
//! are deliberately not attempted here; a per-CPU cache built on this page must be correct (not
//! merely fast) when the answer turns out to be last core's.
//!
//! # The unset case is representable, because a wrong number is worse than no number
//!
//! calef ruled that the same day, about the counter frequency. Two states read as [`None`] rather
//! than as a plausible zero:
//!
//! - A frame nobody prepared reads as zeroes, and zero is a **valid CPU id**. So the page carries
//!   [`MAGIC`] and an unrecognized page has no answer at all.
//! - A prepared page whose thread has never been switched in carries [`UNSCHEDULED`], written at
//!   page-build time, not zero. In practice no code *inside* the thread can observe it, because a
//!   thread cannot execute an instruction without having been switched in first, which is the same
//!   argument by which the value is never stale-in-a-harmful-way on its first read.
//!
//! # A CPU id is not an index, and this is the trap the tree has already paid for
//!
//! The word is a **cpu id**, the kernel's own numbering, and the online set is not `0..count`. On
//! the VisionFive 2 it is `{1, 2, 3}`: slot 0 is an M-mode monitor core with no MMU, and treating
//! the count as a bound put `init` into a parked core's inbox and cost three boots on first
//! silicon (`crates/cpu_set` is the crate that exists because of it). A userspace consumer sizing a
//! per-CPU array must size it by [`CPU_ID_BOUND`] and never by however many cores it has seen.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! A built page reads back the core the kernel last published:
//!
//! ```
//! use current_cpu_protocol::{CurrentCpuPage, build_page, publish};
//!
//! let mut bytes = build_page();
//! let va = bytes.as_mut_ptr() as u64;
//! // SAFETY: `bytes` is a live, 8-aligned buffer of exactly `PAGE_BYTES` for this block, built
//! // by `build_page`, and this thread is its only writer.
//! unsafe { publish(va, 3) };
//! // SAFETY: as above.
//! let page = unsafe { CurrentCpuPage::new(va) };
//! assert_eq!(page.cpu(), Some(3));
//! ```
//!
//! Sizing a per-CPU array, which is the consumer this page exists for:
//!
//! ```
//! # use current_cpu_protocol::{CurrentCpuPage, build_page, publish, CPU_ID_BOUND};
//! let mut caches = [0u64; CPU_ID_BOUND]; // never `[0; cores_i_have_seen]`
//! # let mut bytes = build_page();
//! # let va = bytes.as_mut_ptr() as u64;
//! # // SAFETY: as the example above.
//! # unsafe { publish(va, 3) };
//! # // SAFETY: as the example above.
//! # let page = unsafe { CurrentCpuPage::new(va) };
//! if let Some(cpu) = page.cpu() {
//!     caches[cpu] += 1;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Neither a zeroed frame nor a thread that has never run fabricates an answer:
//!
//! ```
//! use current_cpu_protocol::{CurrentCpuPage, PAGE_BYTES, build_page};
//!
//! let zeroed = [0u8; PAGE_BYTES];
//! // SAFETY: a live, aligned buffer of exactly `PAGE_BYTES` for this block.
//! assert_eq!(unsafe { CurrentCpuPage::new(zeroed.as_ptr() as u64) }.cpu(), None);
//!
//! let fresh = build_page();
//! // SAFETY: as above.
//! assert_eq!(unsafe { CurrentCpuPage::new(fresh.as_ptr() as u64) }.cpu(), None);
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A thread that shares an address space with another thread would share this page, and both
//!   would read one of the two answers.** That cannot happen today: `Tcb::CONFIGURE` consumes the
//!   address-space capability, so no two TCBs name one space: §105 (`std::thread::spawn` stays
//!   declined). This page is per address space,
//!   which is per thread only because of that. **Whoever lifts §105 must make this per thread by
//!   something other than the address space**, and a shared page indexed by a slot the thread
//!   learns at startup is the obvious shape, with the false-sharing cost of packed slots to weigh.
//!   Named here because the constraint is invisible from this crate's own code.
//! - **A process whose address space was built by userspace and never bound to a TCB has no page
//!   here**, and a call to `user_mode_runtime::current_cpu` from it faults on an unmapped read
//!   rather than returning [`None`]. The kernel maps this page when it takes the space
//!   (`AddressSpace::new` for the spaces it builds, `sched::configure_thread_control_block` for the
//!   ones userspace hands it), and those two cover every space that ever runs a thread. The uncovered
//!   shape is a bare address-space object that is used for something other than running a thread,
//!   which by construction has no thread to ask. Deliberately **not** mapped in
//!   `user::user_address_space_create`: doing that for the timebase page cost two regressions on a
//!   hand-sized demo region, and that comment is still beside that function.
//! - **The value can be stale by the time it is used**, for the reason the ordering section gives.
//!   This crate will not fix that, and a consumer that cannot tolerate it wants `rseq`'s
//!   restartable sequences, which are a milestone of their own and not proposed here.
//! - **[`CPU_ID_BOUND`] is a compile-time constant, not this machine's online set.** It is the
//!   kernel's `MAX_CPUS`, single-sourced here so the two cannot drift, and it is deliberately not
//!   the live count: a bound that grew when a secondary came online would be a number userspace
//!   had already sized an array against. Correct for sizing, useless for iterating, and a consumer
//!   that wants to iterate the online set is asking the other question, which the selector answers.
//!
//! Name: provisional (this lane, 2026-09-21). calef names the crates. `current_cpu` is the
//! vocabulary the field already uses for exactly this quantity (Linux's `sched_getcpu`,
//! `smp_processor_id`, `rseq`'s own `cpu_id` field), which puts it in the protected class a reader
//! already knows; `_protocol` is calef's 2026-09-05 ruling on the suffix, the one
//! `counter_frequency_protocol` carries. Refused `self_cpu_protocol`, which reads as a property of
//! a thing called "self" rather than as the current core, and which borrows the branch name rather
//! than the concept. Refused `cpu_id_protocol` as naming the field rather than the page's question.
//! Refused `rseq_protocol`: it is the right prior art and the wrong name, because this carries none
//! of `rseq`'s restartable-sequence machinery and a reader who knew the term would expect it.
//! Refused a register-shaped name (`tpidrro_protocol` and friends) for the reason the register
//! section gives, which is that the register does not exist on two of three targets.
