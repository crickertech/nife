#![no_std]
//! **Enough of FAT32 to create an EFI system partition holding one boot file**, as pure
//! computation (milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install that makes a second
//! customer possible), rung 2a).
//!
//! Name: provisional, minted 2026-09-21 by the rung 2a lane. It follows the tree's
//! expand-the-acronym rule, the one
//! `crates/globally_unique_identifier_partition_table` and `crates/non_volatile_memory_express`
//! already keep: FAT is the File Allocation Table, and a reader who greps `fat` and finds nothing
//! is looking for the expansion. calef names crates; expect this to change.
//!
//! # Why this exists, and what it deliberately is not
//!
//! An installer has to put `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` somewhere the firmware will look, and the UEFI
//! specification says that somewhere is a FAT volume. Nothing in this tree could write one:
//! milestone 515 (a stick that puts itself on the machine's disk)
//! records the hole, and every existing path around it is a host tool (QEMU's `vvfat`, macOS's
//! `diskutil`, Linux's `mkfs.vfat`) that the target cannot reach.
//!
//! **This is a `mkfs` and not a filesystem.** It creates one volume, in one shape, containing one
//! file at one path, and then it is finished. It cannot open, read, extend, delete or rename
//! anything, and it never will: milestone 140 (mount a drive this system did not create)
//! is the read half and is a different piece of work. The shape below is chosen to be the most
//! boring FAT32 volume a firmware could be handed, because the reader is somebody else's driver.
//!
//! **No I/O of any kind**, the same rule `globally_unique_identifier_partition_table` keeps. This
//! crate says what each sector must contain and the caller writes it, so the whole of it compiles
//! for the host and its tests run in milliseconds.
//!
//! # The shape of the volume
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | Sector size | 512 ([`SECTOR`]); FAT32 permits others and nothing here has met one |
//! | Sectors per cluster | 8, so a 4096-byte cluster, which is also `filesystem_protocol::blk`'s transfer unit |
//! | Reserved sectors | 32, the usual FAT32 figure: boot sector, `FSInfo`, and the backup pair at 6 and 7 |
//! | FATs | 2, because every tool writes two and a firmware that reads the second finds it |
//! | Cluster 2 | the root directory: a volume label and `EFI` |
//! | Cluster 3 | `EFI`: the dot entries and `BOOT` |
//! | Cluster 4 | `BOOT`: the dot entries and the boot file |
//! | Cluster 5 onward | the boot file's data, contiguous |
//!
//! **The cluster count is the load-bearing number.** Microsoft's own specification defines the FAT
//! type by how many data clusters the volume has, and every driver in the field follows it: fewer
//! than 65525 and the volume *is* FAT16 whatever the boot sector claims. A volume built here is
//! refused below [`MIN_CLUSTERS`] rather than handed to firmware as a lie about itself.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! Lay out a 512 MiB EFI system partition starting at LBA 2048, holding a 9 MiB boot file, and
//! write it through anything that can put 512 bytes at an LBA:
//!
//! ```
//! use file_allocation_table::{SECTOR, Volume};
//!
//! let volume = Volume::new(1024 * 1024, 2048, 9_000_000, 0x1234_5678, "BOOTX64.EFI")
//!     .expect("512 MiB is a FAT32 volume");
//!
//! let mut sector = [0u8; SECTOR];
//! for index in 0..volume.metadata_sectors() {
//!     assert!(volume.sector(index, &mut sector));
//!     // write `sector` at partition-relative LBA `index`
//! }
//! // then the file's own bytes, contiguous, at this LBA:
//! assert_eq!(volume.file_first_sector(), volume.metadata_sectors());
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The file name must be 8.3 and upper case**, because nothing here writes a long-file-name
//!   entry. `BOOTX64.EFI` and `BOOTAA64.EFI` fit; **`BOOTRISCV64.EFI` does not**, so the riscv64
//!   removable-media path cannot be written by this crate as it stands. That is a real gap for
//!   [milestone 515 (the installer)](../../../design/roadmap/515-the-installer-a-stick-runs-to-put-itself-on-the-disk.md)
//!   on riscv64 and it is recorded rather than worked around: a long-name entry is a checksum and a
//!   run of UTF-16 entries ahead of the short one. It has a milestone of its own,
//!   `design/roadmap/560-a-long-file-name-or-riscv64-cannot-be-installed.md`, which prices it
//!   and says what it does and does not unblock.
//! - **Every timestamp is zero.** A `mkfs` with no clock capability writes 1970 rather than
//!   inventing a plausible date, the same choice `redoxfs_server`'s `mkfs` made and for the same
//!   reason.
//! - **The `FSInfo` free-cluster count is written once and never maintained**, which is what the
//!   specification says a driver must tolerate (the field is a hint). Nothing here ever opens the
//!   volume again, so it cannot go stale from this side.
//! - **Nothing reads back what this writes.** A writer tested against its own reader proves almost
//!   nothing, and this crate has no reader at all. What proves it is **somebody else's FAT driver**,
//!   and two of them do: OVMF, in `cargo xtask install-boot`, whose pass condition is that the
//!   firmware finds and starts the file; and the host's own, in
//!   `tests/a_third_party_driver_reads_it.rs`, which macOS's `msdos` driver mounted and read
//!   byte-exact on 2026-09-21. The unit tests below check the bytes against the specification's own
//!   field offsets, which is a different claim and a weaker one.
//! - **The volume is not crash-atomic and has no journal**, which is FAT. A power cut partway
//!   through writing one leaves a volume no firmware will read.
