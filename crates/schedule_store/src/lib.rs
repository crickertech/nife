//! **The durable schedule store's shared names, and the one document `timetable` does not already
//! own** (milestone 152, DECISIONS §122 and §125).
//!
//! §122 decided the schedule itself: one file per identity, inside that identity's own subtree
//! (DECISIONS §117), in `timetable::parse`'s own document format, unchanged. That answers what one
//! identity's schedule looks like. It does not answer what tells boot-time re-derivation *which*
//! identities have one at all, and neither §122 nor §123 fully specified it: §123 assumes "the store
//! names" a set of sessions to re-derive, without saying how that set is discovered without falling
//! into milestone 126's refusal (enumeration is itself authority). This crate is that answer, worked
//! out as §125 and recorded there: a **manifest**, a second small document at a fixed, well-known
//! location, listing exactly which identities currently have a durable session with pending
//! scheduled work, one name per line.
//!
//! # Why a manifest rather than a directory listing
//!
//! The obvious-looking alternative is to `READDIR` the principal tree's root and treat every
//! subtree found there as "an identity with pending work". That is refused on this tree's own
//! terms: DECISIONS §123 says boot-time re-derivation must not be granted "anything that would let
//! it enumerate users rather than iterate a hard-wired set it was constructed to read", citing
//! milestone 126's enumeration-is-authority rule, and every identity provisioned
//! (`identity_provisioner`, milestone 155) gets a subtree whether or not it ever registers a
//! schedule, so a directory listing would answer a different question than the one boot-time
//! re-derivation needs to ask.
//!
//! A manifest answers the right question instead, and reading it is not enumeration in the sense
//! §123 refuses: `OPEN`ing one file at a name the reader already knows at compile time
//! ([`MANIFEST_FILE_NAME`]) is a targeted lookup, the same shape 152's own reattachment design uses
//! for the credentialer ("given a proven identity, return the one record for it, never a list").
//! What the manifest's *contents* name is data this crate interprets, not a directory the reader
//! walked to find out what exists.
//!
//! # What this crate is not
//!
//! It performs no IO and makes no syscalls (CLAUDE.md rule 7: two programs that must agree on a
//! format share a crate, not a wire convention re-derived twice). The write side
//! (`fixtures/src/fs_test_client.rs`'s `ROLE_SCHEDULE_SEED`, this lane's own demonstration writer) and
//! the read side (`components/src/session_reviver.rs`, the boot-time re-deriver) both depend on it for
//! exactly the same reason `timetable` is shared by the process that writes the shipped
//! `timetable.conf` file and the process that reads it: the parser and the render logic must be one
//! function, not two that could drift.
//!
//! It does not touch `timetable::Schedule` or `timetable::parse` at all, and depends on nothing:
//! the schedule document itself is out of scope here (§122's own subject), and the manifest is
//! small enough that pulling in a whole other crate to write eight lines of text would be the
//! "more machinery" AGENTS.md's elegance tenet warns against.
//!
//! Name: provisional, and ruled: calef ruled **`timetable_store`** on 2026-09-13, immediately after
//! ratifying `timetable`. The block stays `provisional` because the ratified name is not this
//! crate's until the rename is performed.
//!
//! **The question that decided it is the one a reader scanning `crates/` asks**, and calef asked it
//! verbatim: *"What kind of schedule? Is this the thread scheduler?"* It is not. This crate is
//! scheduled *execution*, one document per identity in `timetable::parse`'s format plus the
//! manifest saying which identities have pending work. The thread scheduler is
//! `kernel/src/sched.rs`, which uses the word 128 times and has nothing to do with this.
//!
//! **The tree had already ruled against this collision once and a later lane walked into it.**
//! `crates/timetable` exists under that name precisely because it *"avoids `scheduler`, which in
//! this tree already means `kernel/src/sched.rs` and would make two unrelated things share a
//! word."* `schedule` and `scheduler` are not two words to someone reading a crate list, so
//! stepping around one and taking the other buys nothing.
//!
//! **The provenance that looked strongest was the argument that lost.** `schedule_store` is the
//! plain noun both §122 and §123 already use ("the on-disk, per-user schedule store"), and a name
//! the architect wrote first in a decision, adopted rather than coined by a lane, is better
//! provenance than anything else on that day's worklist. It still loses: those sections say it in
//! running prose, where the surrounding sentences supply the sense. **A crate name has no
//! surrounding sentences.**
//!
//! Refused `schedule_proto`, wrong by the line `crates/soak_page` draws: this is names and a file
//! format, not a request/reply vocabulary. Refused `schedule_file`, which names one of the two
//! documents when the manifest is the other. The maintainer also refused `timetable_store` an hour
//! before calef ruled it, on the ground that the format belongs to `timetable` and the location to
//! the principal tree; that was too clever, since a store of timetables is what the word is for and
//! "store" claims no more authorship than a bookshelf does.
