//! **Windows: drives from the Win32 volume functions; erasing is described, not performed.**
//!
//! Windows names volumes by drive letter, and `GetDriveTypeW` answers `DRIVE_REMOVABLE` from the
//! same removable-media bit the other two hosts read. A USB hard disk answers `DRIVE_FIXED`, so it is
//! refused by the one rule in `disk.rs` without anything Windows-specific. The four functions used
//! are in `kernel32`, which every Windows process already links, so they are declared here by hand
//! rather than through a bindings crate (DECISIONS §46).
//!
//! This file is the pure half, [`disk_from`], tested on every host; `host/windows.rs` is the half
//! that calls Windows.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **None of this has run on Windows.** It cross-compiles for `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, and the
//!   pure half is tested on the development Mac; the four calls into `kernel32` have not executed.
//! - **Erasing is not automated on Windows, deliberately.** A stick that is not FAT gets the
//!   `diskpart` steps printed, with the disk to select left for the person to confirm by size in
//!   `list disk`. Automating it needs the drive-letter-to-disk-number mapping
//!   (`IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER`), and destructive code that has never run once on the host it
//!   targets is the one thing this program should not ship. Promote it when a Windows machine can
//!   run it against a VHD (`diskpart`'s `create vdisk`), which is that host's file-backed disk.
//! - **FAT32 through `format` stops at 32 GB**, which is Windows' own limit and not FAT32's. The
//!   printed steps therefore create a 1 GB partition, which the boot files fit in many times over.
//! - **A drive letter is a volume, not a disk**, so a stick with two partitions appears twice.
