//! **Which disks this program may touch, and what it would do to each.**
//!
//! Every host describes its disks differently (`diskutil` on macOS, sysfs on Linux, drive letters
//! on Windows), and each host module turns its description into a [`Disk`]. Everything after that
//! is here and host-independent, which is the point: the rule that decides whether a disk may be
//! written is one function, [`refusal`], tested once, rather than three rules that can drift.
//!
//! # The rule, and why it is the removable-media bit
//!
//! **A disk is offered only when its media is removable**: the SCSI removable-media bit (RMB) a USB
//! flash stick or an SD card reader sets, which macOS reports as `RemovableMedia`, Linux as
//! `/sys/block/<dev>/removable` (or an `SD` card type on the MMC bus), and Windows as
//! `DRIVE_REMOVABLE`. It is the same bit read three ways.
//!
//! "External" or "USB" is not enough, and the development Mac this was written on is the proof: it
//! has two USB hard disks attached, a 2 TB Seagate Portable and a 3 TB WD My Book, one holding
//! backups. Both report `Internal = false` and `BusProtocol = USB`, and both report
//! `RemovableMedia = false` (`tests/fixtures/macos/usb-*-info.plist`). A rule keyed on the bus would
//! have offered a backup disk for erasing; this one never lists it.
//!
//! **The cost is stated rather than hidden**: a few flash sticks sold as "fixed disks" (some models
//! built for Windows To Go) clear the bit and are not offered. See the crate's BUGS.
