//! **The boot files this program carries, and the note it leaves beside them.**
//!
//! The payload is a set of UEFI applications at the removable-media paths the UEFI specification
//! fixes per architecture (UEFI 2.10, 3.5.1.1): `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` for `x86_64`,
//! `BOOTAA64.EFI` for aarch64, `BOOTRISCV64.EFI` for riscv64. Each firmware looks for its own name
//! and ignores the others, so one stick carrying all three boots on all three, and nobody picks a
//! target. That is the universal stick (U1 in the roadmap block).
//!
//! # Why the kernel and its archive cannot arrive here mismatched
//!
//! Each file is **one** UEFI application that already contains its kernel and the userspace
//! archive that kernel measures (`uefi_loader/build.rs`), and the loader's own build refuses a
//! pair whose archive the kernel does not vouch for. So there is nothing in this program that
//! could pair a kernel with the wrong archive: the only unit it handles is the sealed file. radon
//! and xenon have both halted at `MEASURED BOOT REFUSED` on a mismatched pair that a person
//! copied; this program has no way to express that copy.
