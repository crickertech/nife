//! Machine-checked proofs for the firing arithmetic (milestone 129).
//!
//! **Why this function and not the parser.** A parser is a total function on bytes and the host
//! tests sample it well; a wrong answer there is a document that does not load, which is loud. The
//! arithmetic is the opposite: every wrong answer is quiet. An off-by-one at a period boundary
//! fires an entry twice in one pass and nothing complains; a lost phase drifts an entry a few
//! nanoseconds per hour and shows up as a schedule nobody can explain a month later; a `+ period`
//! that overflows wraps a deadline into the past and turns a scheduler into a spin. None of those
//! is reachable by sampling, because the interesting inputs are the ones nobody thinks to type.
//!
//! Kani quantifies over them instead. The bounds below are stated where they are needed and are
//! generous rather than convenient: `1 << 50` nanoseconds is thirteen days, which is longer than
//! anything this system has stayed up.
//!
//! # The one property that is not here, and why
//!
//! **Phase preservation is host-tested and not machine-checked**, and it is the most interesting of
//! the four laws `next_after` obeys, so the absence is worth a paragraph rather than a shrug.
//!
//! The claim is that the answer is congruent to `prev` modulo `period`. Every way of writing that
//! needs a modulo of a *computed* value on top of the one already inside `next_after`, and a second
//! 64-bit modulo is where CBMC stops finishing: the direct spelling
//! (`next % period == prev % period`) did not return after ten minutes, the cheaper one
//! (`(next - prev) % period == 0`) did not either, and neither did the cheaper one bounded to
//! `1 << 32`. Shipping a harness bounded far enough down to finish would have been worse than
//! shipping none: it would read as proved and cover a range no schedule lives in.
//!
//! What covers it instead: `next_after_is_strictly_in_the_future_and_keeps_its_phase` in the crate's
//! host tests asserts the congruence at values up to `u64::MAX / 4`, across four periods including
//! `1` and a large prime. That is sampling and it is honest about being sampling.
//!
//! **It is also the least likely of the four to be got wrong silently**, which is the reason this is
//! a recorded gap rather than a blocker: the implementation reaches its answer by snapping `now`
//! back onto the beat (`now - (now - prev) % period`), so the phase is not computed and then
//! preserved, it is the only thing the expression can produce. A change that broke it would have to
//! rewrite the line, not slip past a boundary in it.
