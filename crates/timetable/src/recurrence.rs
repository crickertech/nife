//! **Calendar entries: G5's grammar, each line exactly one RFC 5545 RRULE** (milestone 129
//! (scheduled execution); calef ruled "G5 full" on 2026-09-26, recorded in
//! notes/scheduled-execution/calendar-grammar-g5.md).
//!
//! A calendar line says a time of day in UTC: `every day at 02:00`, `every month on last fri at
//! 17:00`, `every 2 weeks on mon starting 2026-10-05 at 08:00`. It is parsed here into a [`Rule`],
//! and [`next`] answers the first occurrence strictly after a minute. Every field RFC 5545 would
//! derive from DTSTART is written in the line, so a rule's occurrences do not depend on when it was
//! registered (the note's rule 4).
//!
//! # Time, here
//!
//! A **minute** is a count of whole UTC minutes since 1970-01-01T00:00Z, as an `i64`. A **day** is
//! that divided by 1440. Seconds do not exist in this grammar (BYSECOND=0), and neither do zones: a
//! line with no zone clause means UTC, forever (the note's rule 5). The conversion to year, month
//! and day is `crates/calendar`'s, which Kani already proves inverse over its whole range.
//!
//! # What the grammar refuses, and why a refusal beats a quiet answer
//!
//! Each refusal in the note's table is an [`Refusal`] variant whose message names the alternative:
//! days 29 to 31 (they skip short months silently; `last day` says month-end), a `5th` weekday,
//! times that do not share a minute (BYHOUR times BYMINUTE is a product), a range that does not end
//! on its last step, a count limited with `in`, a count with no `starting`, a `starting` the rule
//! would not fire on, and `every 15 minutes` spelled out (one space from `every 15m`, which runs on
//! the other clock).
//!
//! Name: provisional, minted 2026-09-26 (UTC) by milestone 129's lane, for this module and every
//! public item in it. Naming is calef's.
