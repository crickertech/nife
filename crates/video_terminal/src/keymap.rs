//! **From a keyboard's scancodes to the bytes a terminal receives** (milestone 29's input).
//!
//! A virtio-input device does not send characters. It sends `virtio_input_event` records carrying
//! **Linux evdev codes**: a physical key going down or coming up, in a numbering that has nothing to
//! do with what is printed on the keycap. Turning those into the wire bytes a terminal understands is
//! a table plus one bit of state, which makes it exactly the kind of thing that belongs on the host
//! (DECISIONS §7) rather than in a driver where a wrong row costs a QEMU boot to find.
//!
//! It lives in this crate rather than in `line_editor` because it is the *display* terminal's input
//! half, and because the driver that uses it (`user/src/keyboard_driver.rs`) already depends on nothing else
//! here. The bytes it produces are the terminal contract's driver half either way
//! (notes/terminal-contract.md, `OP_BYTES`), so a keystroke from this device and a keystroke from the
//! UART are the same thing by the time anything downstream sees it.
//!
//! # What it covers, and the limits that are real
//!
//! A **US layout's main block**: the alphanumerics, the symbol keys, space, enter, tab, backspace,
//! and escape, shifted and unshifted. That is what a terminal needs to be usable and it is where the
//! honest line is: no keypad, no function keys, no arrow keys (a terminal sends escape sequences for
//! those, and this device's codes for them are the *other* half of a mapping `line_editor` already has
//! on the receiving side), no compose, no dead keys, no other layout, and no key repeat beyond what
//! the device itself sends. Recorded in notes/glyphs.md rather than half-built.
