//! **What the milestone-29 tests put on the screen**, in one place so every party agrees.
//!
//! Text on a screen can only be *proved* if the picture is a value more than one independent
//! witness can compute. These constants are that value's input. The kernel-side test sends these
//! bytes to the terminal and then predicts the framebuffer by running the engine itself; the
//! host-side scanout check runs the same engine over the same bytes and grades what QEMU is
//! actually displaying. Neither reads the other's answer, and the terminal component that draws
//! holds none of this: it renders whatever arrives.
//!
//! This is the same move `graphics_proto::pixel` makes for rung one's test pattern and `compositor::SCENE`
//! for rung two's scene: the test's content lives in the contract crate, not in the test.

/// The columns of a terminal that owns the whole scanout: `graphics_proto::WIDTH / bitmap_font::GLYPH_W`.
///
/// Spelled as a literal here rather than computed, because this crate deliberately does not depend
/// on the framebuffer contract (a VT engine that knew about a scanout would be the wrong shape).
/// `user/src/display_terminal.rs` and the kernel wiring both assert the two agree at **compile time**, so a
/// screen that changed size is a build error rather than a terminal quietly missing its last column.
///
/// **132, no remainder**: 924 / 7 is exactly 132, unlike 1280 / 7's six leftover pixels (and 128 /
/// 7's two).
///
/// **Grown from 18 to 182 at milestone 142's increment 1, then retargeted to 132 on 2026-08-27**
/// (`graphics_proto::WIDTH`'s doc comment has the full story: 182 was arithmetic against a *future*
/// 14-pixel cell that never shipped in this increment, applied by mistake to the 7x8 cell that did,
/// producing a grid nearly double any terminal anyone runs). 132 columns is the classic VT100/VT220
/// "wide mode" size at today's 7x8 bitmap font (`bitmap_font::GLYPH_W`/`GLYPH_H`, unchanged by this
/// retarget), and still clears the 80-column floor with real room. When the atlas lands and the
/// cell widens, this constant shrinks with it.

///   ignored SGR would draw every glyph correctly and still fail;
/// - **a `\r\n` pair**, which is what `line_editor::expand_output` puts on the wire for a Unix `\n`, so
///   this is the byte stream a real program's output actually becomes;
/// - **descenders and an underscore** (`y`, `_`), which are the glyph rows a font table truncated to
///   seven rows would lose.
