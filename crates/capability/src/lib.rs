//! Capability tables. **A file descriptor table that can point at anything.**
//!
//! See notes/capabilities.md and DECISIONS.md §10. The one sentence:
//!
//! > A capability is a file descriptor that can point at *anything*, not just files.
//!
//! Same mechanism, generalized. **The unforgeability is boring, and that is the point**: this
//! table lives in kernel memory and userspace never sees a byte of it. Userspace sees an
//! integer. You cannot fabricate slot 7 for exactly the same reason you cannot fabricate `fd 7`.
//! There is no cryptography here and there is no magic. There is an array and a bounds check.
//!
//! Pure logic, so it compiles for the host and its tests run in milliseconds (DECISIONS §7).
//! Nothing in here knows what a console is; the kernel supplies the object type.
//!
//! Allocation-free since milestone 14 phase B.1: the table is a const-generic array, so a
//! capability table's size is part of its type and creating one cannot touch a heap. The kernel picks the
//! size once (16, in kernel/src/cap.rs); the tests and proofs pick small ones.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Rights are a lattice, and the only operation that ever runs on the transfer path is
//! **intersection**: a capability you pass on can never carry more than you held. That is the
//! monotonicity the whole model rests on, so it is what an example should show.
//!
//! ```
//! use capability::Rights;
//!
//! let held = Rights::READ.union(Rights::WRITE);
//! assert!(held.allows(Rights::READ));
//! assert!(!held.allows(Rights::GRANT));
//!
//! // Handing it on with a mask can only ever narrow it.
//! let passed_on = held.intersect(Rights::READ.union(Rights::GRANT));
//! assert_eq!(passed_on, Rights::READ);
//! assert!(passed_on.is_subset_of(held));
//! ```
//!
//! There is no operation that widens, which is worth stating as code because it is a claim about
//! what is *absent*:
//!
//! ```
//! use capability::Rights;
//!
//! let read_only = Rights::READ;
//! // The best you can do with ALL on the other side is get back what you already had.
//! assert_eq!(read_only.intersect(Rights::ALL), read_only);
//! assert!(!read_only.intersect(Rights::ALL).allows(Rights::WRITE));
//! ```
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `caps`. Refused `caps` (a container's
//! name for what is the capability model: it exports `Cap`, `Rights`, `Object`, `Reap` and
//! `CapabilityTable`) and `cap_space` (names one of five exports, and stutters as `cap_space::CapabilityTable`).
//! The exported type was originally kept as `CSpace`, seL4's own spelling; DECISIONS §113's
//! amendment (calef, 2026-08-25) renamed it to `CapabilityTable`, the plain term this crate's own
//! prose already reached for ("A thread's capability table," above).
