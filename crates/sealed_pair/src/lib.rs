//! **Does this kernel vouch for this archive?** The host-side half of measured boot, built for
//! milestone 223 (read a card and say whether its kernel and archive match).
//!
//! A kernel image and the userspace archive beside it are **one sealed set**. The build hashes the
//! archive entries the kernel may enter and compiles those digests into the kernel's own `.rodata`
//! as its trust root (`kernel/build.rs`), and the kernel refuses to enter userspace when the bytes
//! it is handed do not hash to what it carries (`kernel::trust::require`, milestone 22 (trusted init)). Put a kernel from one build beside an archive from another and nothing fails until the
//! board is powered: it boots, prints `MEASURED BOOT REFUSED`, and halts.
//!
//! That halt has reached a bench three times, all of them after a walk to the board, a card swap and
//! a power cycle: radon on 2026-08-15, xenon on 2026-09-17, and a lane's test wiring on 2026-09-19.
//! This crate is the same question asked on the host, where the answer costs nothing.
//!
//! # What it compares, and why that is the thing that decides a refusal
//!
//! The kernel's decision is `measured_boot::verify_digest(TRUST_ROOT, name, sha256(bytes))` for each
//! entry it is about to hand over: the boot programs ([`BOOT_PROGRAMS`]) and, since milestone 104 (the
//! measurement continues past init), the measurement table the progenitor loads everything else
//! against. So the deciding fact is **whether the SHA-256 of each such archive entry appears in
//! the kernel image's trust root**, and nothing else about either file matters.
//!
//! [`inspect`] asks exactly that, by hashing each entry out of the archive with the tree's one
//! SHA-256 and looking for the digest's **32 raw bytes** inside the kernel image. That is what the
//! trust root compiles to, a chance 256-bit match elsewhere in the image is not a case worth a
//! sentence, and it needs no knowledge of where in the image the array landed, which is what lets
//! one function read a flat `booti` image, an ELF, and a UEFI boot file with the pair embedded.
//!
//! The asymmetry is worth stating plainly, because it bounds what this can say: finding a digest
//! proves the kernel vouches for those bytes, while *not* finding one proves only that it does not.
//! It cannot report what the kernel expected instead, because a digest it does not hold is not a
//! digest we can find. See `BUGS`.
//!
//! # The second refusal, one level up
//!
//! A kernel that vouches for the archive still hands the progenitor a table it measures its own
//! loads against, and the progenitor treats a program the table cannot vouch for as one that is not
//! there (`system_initializer`). An archive whose table disagrees with its own contents therefore
//! boots past the kernel and then loses its console. [`inspect`] checks that too, and reports it
//! separately, because it is a different program's refusal.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! A pair built together is sealed, and the verdict is one line:
//!
//! ```
//! # use sealed_pair::{inspect, Seal};
//! # let (kernel, archive) = sealed_pair::test_support::matched_pair();
//! let seal = inspect(&kernel, &archive).expect("the archive parses and carries a progenitor");
//! assert!(seal.is_sealed());
//! ```
//!
//! A kernel from one build beside an archive from another is refused, and the refusal names the
//! entry, which is what makes it actionable:
//!
//! ```
//! # use sealed_pair::inspect;
//! # let (kernel, _) = sealed_pair::test_support::matched_pair();
//! # let (_, archive) = sealed_pair::test_support::other_pair();
//! let seal = inspect(&kernel, &archive).expect("the archive parses and carries a progenitor");
//! assert!(!seal.is_sealed());
//! assert!(seal.explain("nife-vf2.img", "nife-initrd.img").contains("progenitor"));
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **It duplicates a check the kernel already does, deliberately.** The kernel's is the authority
//!   and this is an early warning. If the two ever disagree the kernel is right and this crate is
//!   wrong, and [`Seal::explain`] says so where a person reads it.
//! - **It cannot say what the kernel expected.** A trust root is an array of `(name: &str, digest)`
//!   in the image's `.rodata`, and locating it without the digest as a needle would mean depending
//!   on the struct's layout and on the image's load address. So a refusal names the entry and the
//!   digest the archive *has*, never the one the kernel wanted. `cargo xtask card-check` recovers
//!   the missing half a different way, by comparing both files against the tree's own build.
//! - **It says nothing about the boot script or an `extlinux.conf`**, which are the other two ways a
//!   card can be wrong ; milestone 218 (every boot of the VisionFive 2 needs a
//!   human typing four commands into U-Boot) has just changed which of those a card should carry.
//! - **Nothing forces anyone to run it**, on a card written by hand. Where the pair is built rather
//!   than copied, `uefi_loader/build.rs` makes it a build failure instead, which is the rung above.
//! - **It asks whether the digest is present, not whether the kernel checks it.** The two agree
//!   on every build in the tree today, and a build that carried the digest without reaching the
//!   check would read as **sealed** while verifying nothing. Until milestone 563 (a seal check that
//!   reads bytes cannot see a check that was dropped) that was not hypothetical in its mirror form:
//!   `soak_test`, `job_mix` and `bench` replaced the hand-over, never called the refusal, and the
//!   linker dropped the trust root, so every such card and stick read `NOT SEALED` (measured
//!   2026-09-21 on riscv64 and 2026-09-25 on `x86_64`). Those builds now measure what they enter
//!   through `kernel::trust::require_program`, and the digests are there because the check is. The
//!   scan still cannot tell the difference; option C in
//!   `design/roadmap/563-a-seal-check-that-reads-bytes-cannot-see-a-check-that-was-dropped.md`
//!   prices a build that says so about itself.
//!
//! Name: provisional. Minted 2026-09-19 by the lane that built it. A kernel and the archive it
//! vouches for are one sealed set, and this crate is the one place that says whether two given
//! bytes-on-disk are that set; named for the thing rather than for the act, the way `measured_boot`
//! was named over `measure`. Refused `card_check`, because the pair is checked in three places that
//! are not a card (the UEFI loader's build, a staged directory, a stick's single file) and a name
//! saying "card" would be wrong in two of them; refused `seal`, a verb, and generic enough to name
//! almost anything. calef has not ratified it.
