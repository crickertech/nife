//! **`ps`: what a process listing is when there is no `/proc`** (milestone 126,
//! notes/process-view.md).
//!
//! This is the program's logic, lifted out so it runs on the host in milliseconds; `components/src/ps.rs`
//! is the syscall and the two output streams and nothing else. The crate and the program share a
//! name because they are one thing split at the IO boundary, which is the convention `coremark`,
//! `line_editor` and `compositor` already follow.
//!
//! # What it does not do, which is the whole point
//!
//! `ps aux` on Linux reads `/proc`, which is **ambient**: any process gets it with no grant from
//! anyone, so the listing is every process on the machine, including the command lines with
//! secrets in `argv`. Nobody defends that; `hidepid` exists because enough people stopped wanting
//! it.
//!
//! Here the listing is a **capability**. What this crate is handed is a function that reads one
//! entry of a domain, and that function is backed by `abi::rendezvous::SURVEY` on a supervision
//! endpoint the program was endowed. It cannot widen the domain, cannot ask about a tid it was not
//! shown, and cannot discover that any other domain exists. There is no path here that reaches a
//! process this program's caller did not already have authority over, because the only input is the
//! reader itself.
//!
//! # Three answers, and telling them apart is the deliverable
//!
//! A monitor that reports nothing because it **could not look** is the worst failure this tool has
//! available: it reads exactly like a quiet machine. So the three cases are kept distinct all the
//! way to the terminal:
//!
//! - **A domain with processes in it.** A table on the output stream.
//! - **A domain that is empty.** No rows, and a line on the *diagnostics* stream saying the domain
//!   is empty. Not an error: the caller's authority was never in question.
//! - **A refusal.** No rows at all, and a line on diagnostics naming the reason. `filesystem_protocol` chose
//!   `EPERM` over an empty listing for this exact reason, and so does this.
//!
//! # Collect first, complain second, print third
//!
//! DECISIONS §67 gives a program a second output stream and one rule with it: everything it has to
//! complain about is said, and that stream closed, **before** it writes a byte of output. Its reader
//! is single-threaded and drains diagnostics to end-of-stream first, so a program that interleaved
//! the two would block in a rendezvous nobody is listening for.
//!
//! A survey cannot know its complaints up front: an endpoint can be destroyed halfway through a
//! walk. So [`collect`] takes the whole domain into a buffer first, and the caller then emits
//! [`Survey::write_diagnostics`] and [`Survey::write_report`] in that order.
//!
//! **The buffer is the caller's**, which is not ceremony. It was a `[Row; MAX_ROWS]` local until
//! `script/stack-frame-check` failed the build: two kilobytes of rows made `collect`'s frame 4,336
//! bytes, larger than the 4,096-byte guard page under every kernel thread stack, so one call could
//! move `sp` past the guard in a single step and write into a neighbouring thread's stack without
//! ever faulting. A caller-provided slice is the fix that gate recommends, and it is better anyway:
//! a program that sizes its own listing knows where the memory came from.
//!
//! Sizing it at [`MAX_ROWS`] makes truncation unreachable, because that is the kernel's whole thread
//! table. `ps` does exactly that. A shorter buffer is allowed and is **not silent**: the survey says
//! it was truncated, on diagnostics, for the same reason a refusal is not an empty list.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! At the prompt, in a domain holding two jobs and `ps` itself:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ ps
//!          TID  STATE     TIME(ms)
//!            5  blocked         20
//!            9  running        310
//! 4294967302  dead             150
//! ```
//!
//! The empty and the refused cases, which differ in a way `ps` on Linux has no way to express:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ ps                 ps: this domain holds no processes
//! $ ps                 ps: this endpoint does not carry the right to look
//! ```
//!
//! Driving it from a host test is the whole contract, and it needs no kernel:
//!
//! ```
//! use ps::{MAX_ROWS, Row, collect};
//!
//! // A domain of one running thread: cursor 0 yields it, cursor 1 says done.
//! let mut reader = |cursor: u64| match cursor {
//!     0 => (1, 7, abi::survey::RUNNING),
//!     _ => (abi::survey::DONE as i64, 0, 0),
//! };
//! let mut rows = [Row::default(); MAX_ROWS];
//! let survey = collect(&mut rows, &mut reader);
//! assert_eq!(survey.rows().len(), 1);
//! assert_eq!(survey.rows()[0].tid, 7);
//!
//! let mut text = Vec::new();
//! survey.write_report(&mut |b| text.extend_from_slice(b));
//! assert!(String::from_utf8(text).unwrap().contains("running"));
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A process has no name here, so there is no `CMD` column.** This system has `arg0` in `Spawn`
//!   and no display name at all, so the columns are the tid and the run state and that is
//!   everything. A name is information rather than authority, but a confined viewer may still not
//!   be entitled to it and there is no design for that today; a `CMD` column that appeared without
//!   one would be a leak wearing a familiar heading.
//! - **The tid is a generational name, so it is a large and ugly number** after any slot reuse
//!   (`(generation << 32) | slot`, `crates/slots`). It is printed as the one integer
//!   `abi::rendezvous::REAP` would accept, because splitting it into `gen:slot` would publish the
//!   shape of the kernel's thread table to every program that can run `ps`.
//! - **`ps` itself does not sort.** Rows come out in the kernel's slot order, which is neither
//!   creation order nor tid order once a slot has been reused. There is now something to sort by
//!   (milestone 282 (a thread's CPU time, and the `top` it makes possible)) and
//!   [`Survey::rank_by_cpu_time`] does it, but `ps` does not call it: ranking is what makes a
//!   listing a `top`, and `components/src/top.rs` is the program that does. `ps` has no flag for it
//!   because `ArgSpec` carries one integer and this program spends none, the same limit
//!   `crates/pgrep`'s `BUGS` names for its missing pattern.
//! - **The `TIME` column is two walks, not one.** `abi::rendezvous::SURVEY` answers one record per
//!   call, so a listing with both the state and the CPU time asks the kernel for each thread twice
//!   and joins on the tid ([`Survey::join_cpu_time`]). A thread that dies between the two walks has
//!   a row with no figure in it, printed as `-` rather than as a zero. DECISIONS §204 (how userspace asks where a thread runs) priced the
//!   extra syscall at about 45 microseconds per second for sixty-four threads.
//! - **The state is a snapshot per row, not per table.** See the `BUGS` section of
//!   notes/process-view.md: a row read early in the walk may be stale by the time the table prints.
//! - **No automated run spawns `ps` or `pgrep`.** This crate's own logic has host tests
//!   and `kernel::user::survey_tests` covers the syscall underneath, but both shipped
//!   programs are reachable only from an interactive prompt (`script/shell`): neither
//!   `script/test` nor `script/swish-check` types them. (It said "three" and named `watch` until
//!   milestone 281 deleted that program.) Found 2026-08-27 while raising
//!   [`MAX_ROWS`] with the kernel's thread ceiling, which left a static measurement
//!   (`-Z emit-stack-sizes` against `system_initializer::CHILD_STACK_PAGES`; the numbers are on
//!   [`MAX_ROWS`]) as the only check that the bigger stack-resident buffer still fits. That is a
//!   real check and it is not a run, so anything that only shows up when the program executes has
//!   nothing standing in its way.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review). `ps` is the name
//! every reader already knows from outside this project, which the naming tenet calls the best
//! name available and not one to spend a rename on. Sharing it with `components/src/ps.rs` is the
//! crate-and-program pair the same tenet describes: splitting them would hide the relationship, so
//! `coremark`, `line_editor` and `compositor` all keep one name across the two.
