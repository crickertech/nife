#![no_std]
//! **What this machine advertises, as a document a person edits** (milestone 55's responder).
//!
//! `mdns_proto` takes the whole advertisement as data and hard-codes none of it, deliberately: the
//! disk names are a family's, the flag values are whatever a Mac was measured to accept, and the
//! model string is a knob the reference implementation sets independently of its Samba config. That
//! decision has a consequence somebody has to carry, which is that the values have to come from
//! *somewhere*, and a `const DISKS` inside the responder would put them back where the crate
//! refused to keep them. This is the somewhere: one text document, one parser, host-tested.
//!
//! The format is deliberately dull, because a configuration format is a thing a person edits at
//! two in the morning when their backups have stopped:
//!
//! ```text
//! # comments run to the end of the line
//! host      = GL-BE9300
//! smb-port  = 445
//! model     = MacSamba
//! sys-flags = 0x100
//! disk      = corinne 0x82
//! disk      = chris   0x82
//! ```
//!
//! Every key is required except `disk`, which repeats: one line per Time Machine share, in the
//! order they become `dk0=`, `dk1=` and so on inside the single `_adisk._tcp` TXT record. **One
//! advertisement carries every disk**; a file with two `disk` lines describes one server offering
//! two backup targets, which is what the reference router does, and never two servers.
//!
//! **The IP address is not in the document**, and that omission is the design rather than an
//! oversight. Which address this machine holds is a fact the DHCP lease establishes at run time,
//! so [`Config::advertisement`] takes it as an argument and whoever knows it supplies it. A
//! configuration file that named an address would be a file that goes stale the first time the
//! network changes.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! The reference document (the measured values from calef's router, 2026-08-15) parsed into the
//! advertisement a responder puts on the wire:
//!
//! ```
//! # let doc = "host = GL-BE9300\nsmb-port = 445\nmodel = MacSamba\nsys-flags = 0x100\ndisk = corinne 0x82\ndisk = chris 0x82\n";
//! let config = mdns_config::Config::parse(doc).expect("the document parses");
//! let adv = config.advertisement(Some([192, 168, 8, 1]));
//! assert_eq!(adv.host, "GL-BE9300");
//! assert_eq!(adv.smb_port, 445);
//! assert_eq!(adv.disks.len(), 2);
//! assert_eq!(adv.disks[0].volume, "corinne");
//! assert_eq!(adv.disks[1].flags, "0x82");
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The document is compiled into the responder rather than read from disk.** The program
//!   `include_str!`s it, because a program that read its configuration from a file would need a
//!   file capability, and wiring one into the QEMU gate needs a fixture the FS-side crates do not
//!   yet carry. So editing the advertisement today means a rebuild. The format, the parser and
//!   every error in it are unaffected by that: moving the document onto the filesystem is a change
//!   of delivery, not of shape, and the responder's `BUGS` section names it as the next step.
//! - **Values are checked for length and emptiness, not for meaning.** A `disk` line whose volume
//!   contains a comma or an `=` will produce a TXT entry a client parses differently than intended
//!   (DNS-SD's `key=value` convention gives both characters a job), and nothing here refuses it.
//!   The reference values contain neither. Refusing them would need a rule about what a share may
//!   be called, which is a question for whoever names shares.
//! - **`sys-flags` and a disk's flags are opaque strings**, copied to the wire as written. Their
//!   bits are not decoded anywhere in this tree (notes/mdns.md), so a typo in one is a typo a Mac
//!   sees.
//! - **No IPv6.** [`Config::advertisement`] takes an optional IPv4 address because
//!   `mdns_proto::Advertisement` carries one; the reference emits AAAA as well.
//!
//! Name: provisional. Minted by milestone 55's responder lane on 2026-08-16. `mdns_advertisement`
//! was the alternative and reads better beside `mdns_proto::Advertisement`; `mdns_config` was
//! taken because what the crate holds is the whole of the responder's configuration and the type
//! it produces is only part of it. The stem inherits `mdns_proto`'s acronym question and does not
//! add to it. calef has not ratified it.
