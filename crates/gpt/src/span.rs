//! **Where to read**: a byte range of a disk, restated in the transfer unit a block device
//! actually moves.
//!
//! This is still no I/O (nothing here touches a device); it is the arithmetic between two block
//! sizes, and it exists because on nife those two sizes are never the same number.
//!
//! A GPT is written in *logical* blocks, almost always 512 bytes: the primary header is at LBA 1,
//! the entry array at LBA 2, the backup header at the last LBA. The block service a program holds
//! moves one **filesystem block** per request, 4096 bytes (`filesystem_proto::blk::BLOCK_SIZE`), because
//! that is what RedoxFS reads and what makes a mount's device round trips affordable. So "read LBA
//! 1" is really "read transfer block 0 and take bytes 512..1024 of it", and "read the 33 blocks of
//! the backup table" straddles a boundary that depends on the disk's size.
//!
//! Getting that wrong is an off-by-one that reads a plausible-looking buffer full of the wrong
//! bytes, and the CRC then says the table is broken when the table is fine. So it is one function
//! with its own tests rather than three open-coded divisions in a driver.
//!
//! ```
//! # use gpt::span::Span;
//! // The primary header: LBA 1 of a 512-byte-block disk, fetched 4096 bytes at a time.
//! let s = Span::covering(512, 512, 4096).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!((s.first_block, s.blocks, s.offset), (0, 1, 512));
//!
//! // The whole 16 KiB entry array, starting at LBA 2: five transfer blocks, and the bytes we
//! // want begin 1024 into the first of them.
//! let s = Span::covering(2 * 512, 16384, 4096).unwrap();
