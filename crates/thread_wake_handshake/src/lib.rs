//! **The scheduler's block/wake handshake**: the per-thread state machine that decides when a
//! blocked thread may become runnable, lifted out of `kernel/src/sched.rs` so loom can explore
//! every interleaving of it on the host (milestone 80's method, second retrofit after
//! `work_steal_slot`).
//!
//! # What this is, and what it is not
//!
//! Every field here is written **under `IPC_TABLES`**. That is worth saying in the
//! first breath, because it is the opposite of what "extract the atomic protocol" usually means:
//! there are no hand-rolled atomics in this protocol and no orderings to tune. The concurrency is
//! in the *gaps between critical sections*. A thread that marks itself `Blocked` releases `IPC_TABLES`
//! and keeps running until its core's `switch_to` saves its context; a waker on another core can
//! take `IPC_TABLES` inside that window. Three real races have come out of that window, and each one is
//! a rule in this type:
//!
//! - **Wake-before-switch-out** (found by a 2-in-10 flake; notes/intrusive-queues.md). A waker that
//!   queues a thread still standing on its CPU lets another core switch into a stale context: two
//!   cores in one thread. Rule: [`try_wake`](Handshake::try_wake) finding
//!   [`on_cpu`](Handshake::on_cpu) set parks the wake in
//!   [`wake_pending`](Handshake::wake_pending) instead,
//!   and the thread's own core completes it in [`finish_switch`](Handshake::finish_switch) once the
//!   context is provably saved.
//! - **The undelivered wake.** A wake that delivers nothing would complete a parked `RECV` off a
//!   stale mailbox, with the TCB still linked on its endpoint's wait queue. Rule: the
//!   undelivered-wake gate. `try_wake` refuses to make a waiting thread `Ready` unless the waker's
//!   own critical section delivered something ([`ipc_served`](Handshake::ipc_served)) or aborted
//!   the wait ([`ipc_aborted`](Handshake::ipc_aborted)).
//!
//!   **This one is hardening rather than a fix for an observed failure, and the correction belongs
//!   here because this bullet is what a reader trusts.** It was built against the VisionFive 2's
//!   boot 8 (2026-08-14), read at the time as a boot thread taking a `wake:0x0` on a boot where no
//!   sender to its endpoint existed. The boot-8 lane's **fifth** bench stop (2026-08-15) re-read
//!   those dumps and overturned that: the wake was the worker's real send, and the state read as a
//!   stranded receiver was the terminal state of a completed tour. **The gate has never fired on a
//!   field failure, and `refuse:` has never appeared on a board ring.** It stays because the
//!   transition it forbids is genuinely unsafe and the loom harness below proves that, which is a
//!   property rather than an anecdote. The fifth stop's own write-up is still in flight in that
//!   lane, so no section is cited for it yet.
//! - **A steal racing a switch-out.** A preempted thread sits `Ready` in its core's run queue with
//!   `on_cpu` still set until that core's `finish_switch` runs; a work steal
//!   (`sched::serve_steal_request`) hands queued threads to other cores. The single-owner run-queue
//!   discipline (only the owning core pops, at scheduler entries that come after `finish_switch`)
//!   is the whole reason the thief never receives a thread whose context is still being saved.
//!   Rule: [`switch_in`](Handshake::switch_in) asserts `on_cpu` is clear, so the discipline has a
//!   tripwire at the one place every path to a CPU passes through. (The phrase "steal-then-STOP"
//!   has been used for this family; the nearest recorded artifacts are this edge and
//!   `work_steal_slot`'s BUGS entry about a claimed slot a stopped victim never serves, which is a
//!   liveness question outside both crates' models.)
//!
//! # The division of labor with the kernel
//!
//! The kernel **calls** these transitions; it does not mirror them. The memory_regions-crate precedent
//! (DECISIONS §16's extraction rule): a proof over a copy proves the copy. `Thread` embeds a
//! [`Handshake`] and `sched.rs` goes through these methods at every block, wake, switch and
//! finish-switch site. What stays kernel-side, on purpose:
//!
//! - **The queues.** Run queues, migration inboxes and endpoint wait queues are intrusive pointer
//!   structures under their own synchronization (notes/intrusive-queues.md). The verdict enums
//!   ([`WakeVerdict`], [`SwitchOutVerdict`]) tell the kernel when to push; the push itself, the
//!   trace ring, the SGI and the placement policy are the caller's.
//! - **The out-of-protocol state writes.** Spawn making a thread `Ready`, `depart` marking
//!   `Finished`/`Dead`, `START` promoting an `Embryo`, the killed-thread conversion, and
//!   `schedule()`'s keep-current heal all write [`state`](Handshake::state) directly. They are
//!   `IPC_TABLES`-held single-thread transitions with no cross-core window, and folding them in here
//!   would grow the model without growing the checked surface.
//! - **The self-switch refusal and the reply-role check** (boot 8's companions). Both read queue or
//!   capability state this type cannot see (`schedule()`'s popped tid, `ipc_reply`'s
//!   `WaitRole::Reply` match on [`wait_on`](Handshake::wait_on)'s payload).
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! One rendezvous, as the kernel spells it, with the waker racing the receiver's switch-out:
//!
//! ```
//! use thread_wake_handshake::{Handshake, RunState, SwitchOutVerdict, WakeVerdict};
//!
//! // The receiver, running, parks itself in ipc_recv (under IPC_TABLES):
//! let mut hs: Handshake<(u64, char)> = Handshake::on_cpu_now();
//! hs.park((0, 'r')); // Blocked, waiting on endpoint 0 as a receiver, nothing delivered yet
//!
//! // A spurious wake, nothing delivered: refused, the receiver stays parked (boot 8's gate).
//! assert_eq!(hs.try_wake(), WakeVerdict::Refused);
//! assert_eq!(hs.state, RunState::Blocked);
//!
//! // A sender stages the mailbox and wakes, but the receiver's core has not switched away yet
//! // (on_cpu is still set): the wake is deferred, not queued.
//! hs.serve();
//! assert_eq!(hs.try_wake(), WakeVerdict::Deferred);
//!
//! // The receiver's core finishes the switch: the context is saved, the deferred wake completes,
//! // and the caller queues the thread.
//! assert_eq!(hs.finish_switch(), SwitchOutVerdict::WakeCompleted);
//! assert_eq!(hs.state, RunState::Ready);
//!
//! // Some core pops it and switches in; the recv tail's tripwire holds.
//! hs.switch_in();
//! assert!(hs.delivered());
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Nothing makes a new block path use [`park`](Handshake::park).** The fields are public,
//!   because the kernel has legitimate out-of-protocol writers (listed above), so a future block
//!   site that writes `state = Blocked` by hand opts out of the gate silently. This is the same
//!   limitation notes/scheduler.md records for `wait_on`, one level down. The lint-shaped fix
//!   (private fields plus named methods for every out-of-protocol writer) was considered and not
//!   taken: it would add a dozen passthroughs whose names would imply protocol membership they do
//!   not have.
//! - **A stale [`ipc_aborted`](Handshake::ipc_aborted) weakens the gate for the next park.**
//!   [`park`](Handshake::park) clears `ipc_served` (matching the kernel's block sites) but not
//!   `ipc_aborted`, because the kernel's syscall layer owns that flag through `take_ipc_aborted`
//!   and clearing it here would eat the error. A kernel thread that blocks again without collecting
//!   an abort therefore parks with the gate already half-open. Every current kernel-side caller
//!   either collects the flag or never has it set; nothing enforces that for the next one.
//! - **The loom model checks this protocol under the kernel's locking discipline, not the
//!   discipline itself.** `IPC_TABLES` is modelled as a mutex and the run queue as a slot under it; that
//!   the kernel really does take `IPC_TABLES` at every one of these sites, really does keep run queues
//!   single-owner, and really does run `finish_switch` before the next scheduler entry is
//!   established by reading `sched.rs`, not by the model. See notes/interleaving.md for what the
//!   model covers and what it cannot reach.
//! - **Liveness is out of scope**, here as in `work_steal_slot`: a refused or deferred wake depends
//!   on a later scheduler entry that loom cannot see (the reschedule SGI, the timer tick).
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review). Renamed from
//! `wake_handshake`: more explicit about the subject being woken (a blocked thread, coordinated
//! between a waker on one core and that thread's own core mid-context-switch). Minted 2026-08-14
//! (the block/wake loom extraction, the retrofit the fourth bench stop's audit asked for). Refused
//! along the way: `block_wake` (two verbs; the tenet says nouns), `wake_gate` (names only the
//! boot-8 rule, one of three), `sched_state` and `run_state` (generic words that could name almost
//! anything in a scheduler), `parking` (a verb, and std's `park` vocabulary means something
//! narrower).

    //! Run with `script/interleaving-check`. What the model is and is not: `IPC_TABLES` is a
    //! `loom::sync::Mutex`, the run queue and the migration inbox are booleans under it, the
    //! thread's saved context is a `loom::cell::UnsafeCell` written **outside** the lock (exactly
    //! where `switch_to` writes the real one), and each loom thread is a core executing its
    //! critical sections in the kernel's program order. Loom then explores every interleaving of
    //! those sections, and the `UnsafeCell` turns "the resumer sees a saved context" from an
    //! argument into a checked ordering fact. What it cannot check is that the kernel keeps the
    //! discipline the model encodes (every site under `IPC_TABLES`, queues single-owner); that is
    //! established by reading `sched.rs`. See notes/interleaving.md.
    //!
    //! **Bounds, honestly.** Every harness here is run to exhaustion: no
    //! `LOOM_MAX_PREEMPTIONS`, no `max_branches` trimming. That is affordable because the models
    //! are three or four threads with two or three critical sections each, which is not modesty
    //! but the protocol's real shape: one waker, one victim core, one thief is the whole cast of
    //! every recorded race. The historical-semantics twins are `#[should_panic]`, so each race
    //! reconstruction is required to fail, not assumed to.
