//! **The NTPv4 wire format** (RFC 5905), as pure computation.
//!
//! Milestone 51 gives the machine a wall clock. This crate is the third lane of it: the bytes on
//! the wire and the arithmetic over them, with no socket, no clock, no service and no policy. The
//! clock service owns the offset and the authority to set it; a later phase carries these 48 bytes
//! over `net_stack`. Keeping the protocol here means the parser, the fixed-point conversion and the
//! response checks are host-tested in milliseconds and machine-checked by Kani, rather than being
//! debugged inside a QEMU boot against a live server (DECISIONS §14's rule about what compiles for
//! the host, and the same split `filesystem_proto` and `gfx_proto` make for their contracts).
//!
//! # Scope: unauthenticated NTPv4, deliberately and only
//!
//! **This crate implements plain, unauthenticated NTPv4. It does not implement NTS (RFC 8915), and
//! it does not implement the RFC 5905 symmetric-key MAC.** That is a scope decision, not an
//! oversight, so here is exactly what it does and does not buy.
//!
//! What it buys: correct time from a server you can reach, on a path where nobody is injecting
//! packets. That is the ordinary case, and it is why plain NTP is still what most machines run.
//!
//! What it does not buy: any defence against an attacker who can see your request and beat the real
//! server's reply back to you. Everything standing between this crate and that attacker is in
//! [`Query::accept`]: the mode must be right, the origin timestamp must match the nonce we sent, the
//! stratum must be sane, the timestamps must be self-consistent. An off-path attacker who cannot see
//! the request has to guess the 64-bit nonce; an on-path attacker reads it and wins. **Plain NTP has
//! no answer to an on-path attacker and this crate does not pretend otherwise.** Treat a time
//! obtained through it as untrusted input to a service that applies bounds, which is precisely how
//! milestone 51 arranges the authority: the NTP client can *propose* a time and cannot set one.
//!
//! NTS is the real answer and it is a **separate decision**, because it is not a small addition:
//! NTS-KE is TLS 1.3, TLS needs certificate validation, and certificate validation needs a roughly
//! correct clock, which is the thing we are trying to obtain. The standard escape (a build-time "not
//! before" timestamp plus the RTC's rough value) is a design fork with real consequences, and the
//! roadmap records it as one. Half-implementing NTS here, an extension-field parser with no
//! cryptography behind it, would be worse than not having it: it would put "NTS" in the tree while
//! authenticating nothing.
//!
//! # The three things that are easy to get wrong
//!
//! 1. **An NTP timestamp is not a Unix timestamp.** 64 bits: 32 of seconds since **1 January 1900**,
//!    32 of fractional second. The epoch differs by [`UNIX_DELTA`] seconds and the fraction is binary
//!    (a tick is 2<sup>-32</sup> s ≈ 233 ps), not decimal. See [`Timestamp`].
//! 2. **The 32-bit second field wraps**, on 7 February 2036 at 06:28:16 UTC. [`Timestamp`] handles
//!    that with a fixed pivot rather than ignoring it; the rule and its consequences are on
//!    [`Timestamp::to_unix`], and the representable window is [`UNIX_MIN`]`..`[`UNIX_LIMIT`].
//! 3. **The offset and delay arithmetic must be modular**, not absolute. Differences are taken in
//!    wrapping 64-bit arithmetic and read back as signed ([`Interval`]), which is what makes an
//!    exchange that straddles the 2036 boundary come out right instead of off by 136 years.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! One exchange, end to end. The client is 2 seconds behind the server and the path takes 20 ms
//! each way, and the numbers that come out say exactly that:
//!
//! ```
//! use ntp_proto::{Packet, Query, Timestamp, VERSION, leap, mode};
//!
//! // T1: what our clock said when we sent. The nonce is separate, and is 64 random bits.
//! let sent = Timestamp::from_unix(1_800_000_000, 0).unwrap();
//! let nonce = Timestamp::from_bits(0x9e37_79b9_7f4a_7c15);
//! let query = Query::with_nonce(sent, nonce);
//!
//! // On the wire the transmit field is the nonce, not the time; a server never interprets it.
//! let request = Packet::parse(&query.request()).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(request.transmit, nonce);
//! assert_eq!(request.mode, mode::CLIENT);
//!
//! // A server whose clock is 2 seconds ahead of ours, taking 1 ms to turn the request around.
//! let reply = Packet {
//!     leap: leap::NONE,
//!     version: VERSION,
//!     mode: mode::SERVER,
//!     stratum: 2,
//!     origin: request.transmit, // echoed, and this is the whole off-path defence
//!     receive: Timestamp::from_unix(1_800_000_002, 20_000_000).unwrap(), // T2
//!     transmit: Timestamp::from_unix(1_800_000_002, 21_000_000).unwrap(), // T3
//!     ..Packet::default()
//! };
//!
//! // T4: our clock when the reply landed, 41 ms of our time after we sent.
//! let dest = Timestamp::from_unix(1_800_000_000, 41_000_000).unwrap();
//! let sample = query.accept(&reply.to_bytes(), dest).unwrap();
//!
//! // 2 seconds behind, to within the tick truncation, and 40 ms of path.
//! assert_eq!(sample.offset.nanos() / 1_000_000, 2_000);
//! assert_eq!(sample.delay.nanos() / 1_000_000, 40);
//! ```
//!
//! The check worth demonstrating on its own is the one that runs **before any of the packet is
//! believed**. An off-path attacker can flood us with well-formed stratum-1 replies, and without
//! the nonce it holds there is nothing it can do with them:
//!
//! ```
//! use ntp_proto::{Packet, Query, Reject, Timestamp, VERSION, leap, mode};
//!
//! let sent = Timestamp::from_unix(1_800_000_000, 0).unwrap();
//! let query = Query::with_nonce(sent, Timestamp::from_bits(0x9e37_79b9_7f4a_7c15));
//!
//! // A perfect packet from a perfect server, claiming the year 2000. It is simply not ours.
//! let spoof = Packet {
//!     leap: leap::NONE,
//!     version: VERSION,
//!     mode: mode::SERVER,
//!     stratum: 1,
//!     origin: Timestamp::from_bits(0), // the attacker had to guess, and 64 bits is a lot
//!     receive: Timestamp::from_unix(946_684_800, 0).unwrap(),
//!     transmit: Timestamp::from_unix(946_684_800, 1).unwrap(),
//!     ..Packet::default()
//! };
//! let dest = Timestamp::from_unix(1_800_000_000, 1_000_000).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(query.accept(&spoof.to_bytes(), dest), Err(Reject::OriginMismatch));
//!
//! // An unsolicited broadcast does not even get that far: mode 5 is not a reply.
//! let broadcast = Packet { mode: 5, ..spoof };
//! assert_eq!(query.accept(&broadcast.to_bytes(), dest), Err(Reject::Mode(5)));
//! ```
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! [`Packet::parse`] is **total on a 48-byte input**: it decodes fields and judges nothing, so
//! parse-then-serialise is the identity for every possible packet (proved, not asserted). Every
//! semantic judgement lives in [`Query::accept`], which is the only function in the crate that can
//! reject. That split is what lets the round-trip proof be over arbitrary bytes and the security
//! checks be read in one place.
//!
//! ```text
//!   [u8; 48] ──parse──► Packet ──accept(nonce, sent, dest)──► Sample { offset, delay }
//!                                       │
//!                                       └── Reject: the response is not an answer to our question
//! ```
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review, confirming
//! milestone 46's own reasoning). The wire contract was spelled four ways (`filesystem_proto`,
//! `graphics_proto`, `netproto`, `line_editor::proto`) for one concept; `*_proto` won on
//! 2026-07-30 under DECISIONS §39, and `script/lint` has checked it since. Unlike its siblings,
//! the `ntp` stem itself is not this tree's word to spell out: NTP is RFC 5905's own name for the
//! protocol, the same external-standard exemption `elf`/`pci`/`dtb`/`gpt` already carry.
