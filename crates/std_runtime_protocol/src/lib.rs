//! **The std runtime contract**: where a `std` program on nife finds each authority it was given.
//!
//! Name: provisional. Introduced 2026-09-25 by milestone 595 (provisional), in which the shell runs
//! a `std` program. It needed the progenitor to build a child in this layout and found the numbers
//! written three times: in the std PAL's `rt.rs`, and twice in the kernel test harness. The
//! `_protocol` suffix follows `environment_protocol` and `clock_protocol`, the contracts the same
//! PAL already reads; the stem says which runtime. Expect calef to rename it.
//!
//! A native nife program is handed its capabilities in the order its spawner lists them, and
//! reads them by position. A `std` program cannot work that way, because the code reading the
//! slots is the standard library, written once for every program: `File::open` has to know where
//! the directory is without the program saying. So a `std` program's slots are **fixed by
//! number**, and an empty slot is how std learns it was not given that authority. `std::fs` on a
//! program with slot 4 empty answers `Unsupported`, which is what "no ambient filesystem" looks
//! like from inside.
//!
//! ```text
//!   slot 0  untyped     the heap's budget            always
//!   slot 1  endpoint    stdout and stderr            always
//!   slot 2  endpoint    the network stack            only if given the network
//!   slot 3  untyped     socket frames' budget        only if given the network
//!   slot 4  endpoint    one directory                only if given a directory; page at FS_PAGE
//!   slot 5  page frame  the wall clock, READ         only if given a clock; page at CLOCK_PAGE
//!   slot 6  endpoint    the entropy service          only if given randomness
//!   slot 7  page frame  TZ, LANG and TERM, READ      only if given configuration; page at CONFIG_PAGE
//! ```
//!
//! What each slot means to std, and what std does when it is empty, is `rt.rs`'s documentation,
//! beside the code that reads them. This crate is the numbers, so the PAL, the progenitor and the
//! kernel test harness cannot disagree about them.
//!
//! **Generated verbatim into the PAL** by `cargo xtask std-src` (as `sys/pal/nife/runtimeproto.rs`),
//! the same discipline as `abi` and every other contract the PAL reads, so this file must stay a
//! valid non-root module: no crate attributes survive the copy, and neither does the test module.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The image and the stack are not in here**, and they are part of the layout. A std program is
//!   linked at `0x40_0000` like every other, and its stack grows down from `0x50_0000`, the
//!   loader's one address for every child (`supervision_protocol::CHILD_STACK_VA`). So a std image
//!   over about 1 MiB meets its own stack. That is milestone 206 (a program image has under 896
//!   KiB) and DECISIONS §171 (where a program image starts), both open, and this crate does not
//!   pretend to have answered them.
