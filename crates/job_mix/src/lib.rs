//! **The job mix a multi-tasking benchmark runs, defined once** (milestone 168).
//!
//! `design/decisions/96-process-kernel-or-event-kernel.md` asks whether this kernel should keep a
//! kernel stack per thread. Three of its four inputs are settled; the live one is performance, and
//! the retrospective it rests on is explicit that the difference **does not appear where this
//! project measures**: Warton's event kernel was "generally within 1% on micro-benchmarks but a 20%
//! performance advantage of the event kernel on a multitasking workload (AIM7)" (Elphinstone and
//! Heiser, *L4 Microkernels: The Lessons from 20 Years of Research and Deployment*, ACM TOCS 34(1),
//! April 2016, section 4.1; read from
//! <https://trustworthy.systems/publications/nicta_full_text/8988.pdf> on 2026-09-04).
//!
//! Every instrument this tree owns is on the wrong side of that sentence. This crate is the shape
//! of the one that is not: the **workload definition** both halves of the instrument agree on, so
//! the kernel-side supervisor and the EL0 task read one description of what a job is rather than
//! two copies that drift. AGENTS.md rule 7 is why it is a crate and not a `#[path]` module.
//!
//! **What that sentence does not license is a comparison against the 20% itself**, and the first
//! two entries in [`BUGS`](self#bugs) say why: Warton's AIM7 ran on Wombat, a hosted Linux, and the
//! 20% is a ratio between two kernel models where this tree has one. This instrument is for finding
//! out whether the *mechanism* behind that number is live here.
//!
//! # What AIM7 actually is, since the name is not self-explanatory
//!
//! Read rather than recalled, on 2026-09-04, from the benchmark's own README
//! (<https://github.com/davidlohr/areaim/blob/master/osdl-aim-7/_NOTICES/README.aim7>) and the
//! encyclopaedia entry that summarises it: AIM Multiuser Benchmark Suite VII forks many processes
//! called **tasks**, each of which runs, **in random order**, a set of subtests called **jobs**.
//! There are 53 job kinds covering disk-file operations, process creation, user virtual-memory
//! operations, pipe I/O and compute-bound arithmetic, and a **workfile** sets the proportions. A run
//! is a sequence of **subruns** with the task count incremented between them; each subrun ends when
//! every one of its tasks has finished its jobs, and reports **jobs completed per minute**. The
//! final report is that throughput against task count.
//!
//! Four properties do the work there, and this crate keeps all four:
//!
//! 1. **Heterogeneity.** A task alternates between unrelated kernel paths rather than hammering
//!    one. That is the property a micro-benchmark cannot have by construction.
//! 2. **Random order per task.** Tasks are not in lockstep, so the machine sees a mixed arrival
//!    stream instead of a phase-aligned one.
//! 3. **A task-count sweep.** The result is a curve, not a number.
//! 4. **Throughput, not latency.** Jobs per minute, timed to the completion of the slowest task.
//!
//! **What is deliberately not kept is AIM7's own 53 jobs**, and the reason is not effort. Most of
//! them name a Unix service this system does not have and should not grow one to be measured:
//! `fork`, `link`, `sync`, `signal` handlers, `sbrk`. Porting the names would produce a benchmark
//! measuring a shim. The mix below keeps AIM7's *categories* instead, expressed in this kernel's own
//! primitives, and [`BUGS`](self#bugs) records which categories are still missing.
//!
//! # The seven jobs
//!
//! | job | AIM7 category | what it costs here |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`COMPUTE`] | compute-bound arithmetic loops | no syscall at all; the control arm |
//! | [`TOUCH`] | user virtual-memory operations | a working set walked in user mode, no syscall |
//! | [`NULL_SYSCALL`] | (the trap itself) | EL0 to EL1 and back, the cheapest kernel entry |
//! | [`YIELD`] | (scheduling pressure) | a full context switch through the ready queue |
//! | [`ROUND_TRIP`] | pipe I/O | `CALL` to a shared server and its `REPLY`: two rendezvous |
//! | [`MAP`] | user virtual-memory operations (mapping) | split a region, build a space, 32 `MAP_INTO`s, `DESTROY` |
//! | [`SPAWN`] | process creation | build two children from EL0, `RECV` each one's exit, reclaim |
//!
//! [`MAP`] and [`SPAWN`] were added on 2026-09-19. They are the two jobs whose kernel path goes
//! deepest and takes a lock other tasks' same job also wants (the memory-region table), and
//! [`SPAWN`] is the one where a task blocks on a thread that did not exist a moment before. Both use
//! only verbs and capability kinds that existed already: each task is granted its own untyped
//! budget ([`SLOT_BUDGET`]) and builds the objects it maps or starts, the shape
//! `os_primitives_benchmarker`'s `map_el0` and `spawn_el0` loops already had. No syscall, method or
//! object type was added for them.
//!
//! **[`ROUND_TRIP`] is the one that answers §96 and the other six are what make it a workload.**
//! A process kernel's cost is the kernel stack a blocking thread leaves behind, so the quantity that
//! matters is how many *distinct* stacks the machine cycles through and how much of the cache each
//! displaces between visits. [`COMPUTE`] and [`TOUCH`] are what displace it: they are the
//! "application" that runs between two kernel entries, which is the thing
//! `kernel/src/bench.rs`'s `app_displacement` (milestone 134's E4) measures in isolation and which a
//! ping-pong micro-benchmark leaves out entirely.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **No number from this instrument is comparable with Warton's 20%, and the missing categories
//!   below are not what stops it.** Checked on 2026-09-13 against both sources. The retrospective
//!   names only "the Pistachio process kernel vs an event-based (single-stack) kernel with
//!   continuations on an ARMv5 processor" (section 4.1, page 1:16) and never says what userland
//!   AIM7 ran under. Warton's own thesis does
//!   (<https://trustworthy.systems/publications/theses_public/05/Warton%3Abe.pdf>, section 5.4):
//!   **AIM7 ran on Wombat**, the paravirtualised ARM Linux, so the 20% is a delta between two
//!   microkernels measured through a hosted Linux's syscall path, where this is a native workload.
//!   It is also a **ratio between two kernel models** and this tree has one, so the mix produces
//!   one arm and no ratio, whatever jobs it contains. What the instrument can still do is show
//!   whether the *mechanism* Warton offered as the only explanation (kernel cache and TLB
//!   footprint) is live here, which is a knee in jobs-per-minute against task count and is a real
//!   input to §96. See notes/job-mix.md.
//! - **Two of the three categories below were disabled in the AIM7 run being cited, and that run
//!   was two tasks with no sweep.** Warton's section 5.4 turned off the filesystem jobs (the
//!   ramdisk was too small) and the network jobs (Wombat had no `GetHost`), and used "2 clients
//!   with the normal workload file". So the disk-file gap below is not a gap against the number
//!   this crate exists to chase, and [`TASK_SWEEP`] is this instrument's own good idea rather than
//!   a reproduction of Warton's method. **Warton also doubted his own result**, calling it
//!   something to treat "with scepticism until it can be satisfactorily explained" and never
//!   running the cache simulation that would have explained it. Quote the 20% with that attached
//!   or do not quote it.
//! - **One of AIM7's categories is still absent: disk-file operations.** Page mapping and process
//!   creation were added on 2026-09-19 ([`MAP`], [`SPAWN`]); the disk job was not, for two reasons
//!   checked against the tree: nothing nife runs on radon can read a disk (every file-service path
//!   starts at a virtio block device), and the file service maps one shared channel into every
//!   client, which 32 concurrent tasks would race on. Both, and the options, are in
//!   `design/roadmap/proposals/a-disk-file-job-mix-needs-a-disk-radon-can-drive.md`. The honest
//!   reading of a result from this mix is that it covers compute, user memory, the trap,
//!   scheduling, IPC, mapping and process creation, and no filesystem. **Closing it would make a
//!   better likeness of AIM7 in general and would not make a number from it comparable with
//!   Warton's**, for the two reasons the bullets above give.
//! - **[`MAP`] and [`SPAWN`] both take the kernel's one memory-region lock**, so at the top of the
//!   sweep part of what they measure is that lock rather than the map or spawn path. That was the
//!   stated reason they were first refused. It is now measured rather than feared: each task times
//!   its `SPLIT` and `DESTROY` calls separately and the supervisor prints them as `region_ticks` on
//!   every `job-mix-kind:` line, so a reader can subtract it. Under QEMU (which is no result, only a
//!   proof the accounting works) the region calls were 20 to 35% of a map job and 9 to 27% of a
//!   spawn job on aarch64, with the share **falling** as tasks rose, because the rest of the job
//!   (waiting for a child to be scheduled) grew faster. What it is on radon is a bench question.
//! - **The per-kind breakdown is self-timed and includes preemption.** A job's ticks are wall time
//!   from its first instruction to its last, so a task descheduled mid-job charges the wait to that
//!   job's kind. That is the quantity a multi-tasking benchmark wants (which kinds get slower under
//!   load), and it is why the per-kind totals do not add up to the subrun's wall clock times the
//!   task count.
//! - **The mix proportions are chosen, not derived.** AIM7 ships workfiles for four machine roles
//!   (multiuser, compute server, large database, file server) and nobody here has one for a
//!   capability microkernel. [`MIX`] is a flat-ish spread with the IPC job weighted up, on the
//!   argument that IPC is what this kernel is for. A different mix would give a different number,
//!   and no result from this instrument should be quoted without saying which mix produced it.
//! - **The per-job work constants are sized for a real machine, not for TCG.** A QEMU icount run of
//!   the full sweep takes minutes and its magnitudes are fiction, which is the same caveat every
//!   `--real`-only benchmark in this tree carries. The rehearsal exists to prove the mechanism.
//! - **[`order`] is a shuffle, not a random sequence.** Every task runs exactly the same multiset of
//!   jobs, in a per-task order. That is what makes two tasks' work comparable, and it is a
//!   simplification against AIM7, whose tasks draw independently.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-13 (calef, working the unratified worklist). Coined by milestone 168's
//! lane on 2026-09-04. A noun pair naming the thing the crate defines, in the `snake_case` this
//! tree's crates use, and it is the phrase the source itself uses: AIM7's workfile is a *mix* of
//! *jobs*.
//!
//! **The stem was settled a week before this ruling, while calef ratified something else.**
//! `job_mix_task` was chosen over the maintainer's `mix_task` on 2026-09-05 for a reason the
//! maintainer had not made: *the family stays greppable as one string*, so `job_mix` finds this
//! crate, `fixtures/src/job_mix_task.rs` and `script/job-mix`. Three members in three naming
//! domains, each correct for its own, which is the domain table working rather than a coincidence.
//!
//! **That sentence counted three members and there were four, so the property it rests on was
//! already false when it was written** (found and repaired by milestone 296). The fourth is the
//! kernel-side supervisor of this same workload, and it was spelled `kernel/src/jobmix.rs`, with a
//! `jobmix` Cargo feature and `jobmix:` console markers. A squish is exactly what a
//! separator-insensitive grep cannot reach: at `9b68f17e`, `git grep -lie 'job[_-]mix'` returns 31
//! files and `git grep -lie jobmix` returns 25, and `kernel/src/user.rs` is in the second set and
//! not the first. So the greppability the ratification was *made for* did not hold, and it did not hold
//! because of the one member nobody had counted.
//!
//! **The repair is therefore not the hyphen rule being applied to a stray file. It is this
//! ruling being carried out.** `job_mix` is the ratified name of this thing; `jobmix` was a
//! misspelling of it. The module is `kernel/src/job_mix.rs`, the feature is `job_mix`, and
//! `script/board-image`'s flag is `--job-mix`.
//!
//! **The console markers went to `job-mix:`, the command's spelling rather than this crate's, and
//! calef ratified that on 2026-09-14** (`job-mix:` and `job-mix-census:`), on the argument below.
//! **The rule it settles, which is the part worth carrying forward**: a console marker takes the
//! spelling of the command a reader typed to produce it, not of the crate that implements it,
//! because the reader's path to the string runs through the command. That makes `soak`'s markers a
//! precedent rather than a coincidence, and gives the next workload's markers an answer before
//! anyone has to ask.
//!
//! The case as it stood when he ruled: A marker is neither a Rust identifier nor a shell command; it is a
//! string a person reads on a serial console after typing `script/job-mix`, and the one recogniser
//! that matches it sits beside `script/board-console`. `kernel/src/soak.rs` sets the precedent by
//! accident rather than by argument, since `soak` is one word and cannot show a seam: its markers
//! matched `script/soak` exactly without anyone having to decide that they should.
//!
//! **That precedent has since been tested, and it held.** calef ruled `script/soak` to `soak-test`
//! the same day, and the markers moved with the command to `soak-test:` and
//! `soak-test-census:` rather than staying with the crate or the module, which are still spelled
//! `soak`. So the rule stated here is not a description of one accident: it predicted what a rename
//! would do to a marker, and the rename did it. If that rename has not landed where you are reading
//! this, the markers there still say `soak:`. The deciding evidence was that
//! `xtask`'s own line already read "job-mix: QEMU ended before printing `jobmix: done`", one
//! sentence in two spellings. calef names what a reader meets, and this is a reader-facing string
//! he has not ruled on.
//!
//! **The refusal of `aim7` was righter than this block knew**, and the reason is worth recording
//! because it inverts the usual direction. It was refused for claiming somebody else's benchmark.
//! A premise check on 2026-09-13 (`notes/job-mix.md`, and the correction in §96) found the
//! benchmark is not merely unclaimed but **unreachable in principle**: Warton ran AIM7 on Wombat,
//! the paravirtualised ARM Linux, so the number this crate was built toward is a delta between two
//! kernel models measured through a hosted Linux, and this tree has one kernel model and no hosted
//! Linux. A name that had claimed AIM7 would now be claiming something that cannot be done here at
//! all.
//!
//! Refused `workload`, too general for a tree that already has a soak workload and a compute
//! workload. Refused `benchmark`, because this crate is the workload's *definition* and produces no
//! measurement: the same distinction `os_primitives_benchmarker`'s own header draws between the
//! agent and the output.

#![no_std]
#![deny(missing_docs)]

// **The console markers, which are a contract and not a wording** (milestone 324 part 2).
//
// Everything below this comment and above `COMPUTE` is text that leaves the machine and is read
// back by something that is not the machine: `crates/board_console` on a bench or in CI, and
// `cargo xtask job-mix` under QEMU. `crates/boot_ladder` holds the boot tour's markers for exactly
// this reason and its header carries the argument; these are the sweep's, and they lived as four
// private `const`s in `kernel/src/job_mix.rs` plus four string literals in `xtask/src/main.rs`
// until this milestone. Three copies of a contract agreeing by a reader having checked is milestone
// 268's finding 3, and the fix is the one that milestone found: there is one of them.
//
// They are **stable heads**, on `boot_ladder`'s rule and for its reason: the head is what a matcher
// keys on and never changes, the tail carries the numbers and is free to improve. A contract on
// the whole line would make every improvement to the diagnosis a breaking change.
//
// Names provisional (milestone 324): they are printed and matched, so they are a contract, and
// calef names public items. Spelled as bare nouns to match `boot_ladder`'s `BANNER`, `MACHINE`,
// `TOUR`; the kernel's own `START_MARKER` and `DONE_MARKER` spellings were retired into these
// rather than moved, because `job_mix::START_MARKER` says *marker* twice.
