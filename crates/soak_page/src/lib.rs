//! **The one page the soak workload and the kernel share**, and the arithmetic they both do to it
//! (milestone 219).
//!
//! The soak is a user program and the detection is in the kernel, which is the division milestone
//! 219 was briefed with and the reason this crate exists at all: the workload's own progress is a
//! fact only the workload knows, and the kernel has to read it every heartbeat without asking. A
//! shared page is the cheapest way for it to, and it costs the workload one store per round trip
//! rather than a syscall.
//!
//! Rule 7 of `AGENTS.md` ("anything two binaries must agree on is a crate") is why this is a crate
//! and not two copies of a `const`. The kernel's `soak` module writes nothing here; it only reads,
//! and the workload only writes its own slot. That asymmetry is what makes the page safe without a
//! lock: each `u64` has exactly one writer, and a `u64` store does not tear on any of the three
//! architectures.
//!
//! Milestone 221 added the third array. A waiter blocks on the tick route the soak build signals
//! from `sched::on_tick` and counts its wakes here, apart from the round-trip total, because the
//! two are not the same quantity and a reader comparing runs must not have to guess which they are
//! holding.
//!
//! # What is NOT in here
//!
//! The anomaly counters (refused wakes, deferred wakes, remote placements, steals) are the
//! *kernel's* numbers and stay in the kernel, in `sched`'s per-core trace counters. A user program
//! that could write them could also lie about them, and a soak whose tripwire the subject can
//! reach is not a tripwire.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A worker that dies stops writing and looks exactly like a worker that wedged.** Both are
//!   failures, both are caught by the same stall check, and the kernel's report cannot tell them
//!   apart from this page alone; the thread dump it prints on failure can.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-13 (calef, working the unratified worklist). Coined by milestone 219's
//! lane on 2026-09-01. A noun for the thing it describes: the one page the soak workload and the
//! kernel share.
//!
//! **The refusal is the valuable half, and it draws a line the rest of `crates/` follows without
//! writing down.** `soak_proto` was refused because **nothing here is a wire protocol: it is a
//! memory layout**, and the `_proto` suffix in this tree names request/reply vocabularies. That
//! puts this crate in a family with `block_roster` and `grant_plan::job_page_frame`, against
//! `clock_protocol`, `credential_protocol` and `supervision_protocol` on the other side of the line.
//!
//! **The list this block used to give was wrong on its own terms**, and the correction is recorded
//! rather than quietly swapped: it named `clock_protocol` and `counter_frequency_protocol` as examples of "the
//! shape the tree already uses for a layout", when both are `_proto` crates and therefore the
//! counter-examples the very next sentence distinguishes. `counter_frequency_protocol` also became
//! `counter_frequency_proto` by calef's ruling the same day, so the citation was about to dangle as
//! well as contradict.
//!
//! Refused `soak_counters` for naming half the content: the page carries `rounds`, `mismatches` and
//! `wakes` per worker, and the arithmetic both sides do to find them. Refused
//! `soak_heartbeat_page`: the kernel reads this every heartbeat, but the page is not the heartbeat,
//! it is what the heartbeat reads.
