//! The synchronous-rendezvous state machine (DECISIONS §14, milestone 18; intrusive as of
//! milestone 14 phase A.3).
//!
//! This owns the decision core of `kernel/src/sched.rs`'s IPC: the two wait queues and the
//! pending-signal count, and what a send, a receive, or a signal *does* with them. The kernel
//! wraps it with the bookkeeping the queues cannot express (mailboxes, waking a thread onto a
//! run queue, the one-shot Reply that leaves a caller blocked); the *policy* lives here, proved,
//! and the scheduler calls it rather than hand-rolling the same branch six times.
//!
//! The wait queues are **intrusive** (`crates/intrusive`): generic over the node type, so in the
//! kernel a queue entry *is* the TCB, threaded through the same link the run queues use. One link
//! means one queue, so "a blocked thread waits on exactly one rendezvous" is a property of there
//! being one field, not a rule anyone keeps. The queues are the kernel's real rendezvous state, not
//! a model kept in sync; what changed at A.3 is only what a queue entry is (a TCB pointer, no
//! longer a Tid to be looked up) and that queueing can no longer allocate.
//!
//! The load-bearing invariant, unchanged since the original `Rendezvous`: **"at most one wait
//! queue is ever non-empty."** A sender that finds a receiver rendezvouses instead of joining a
//! queue, so a thread only queues when nobody was waiting for it. Every operation is proved to
//! preserve it, now over the real intrusive queues (the `Fifo`'s own FIFO correctness is proved
//! separately, in its crate; here we prove the *decisions* made over it).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The three decisions an rendezvous makes, and the invariant holding across all of them. `T` is the
//! kernel's TCB; here it is a stand-in with the same one link, because one link is the whole reason
//! the invariant is structural rather than remembered.

    //! **The node outlives the rendezvous.** Each test declares its nodes before its `Rendezvous`, and
    //! Rust drops locals in reverse declaration order, so `e` is destroyed first. A node parked on a
    //! queue when the test ends is therefore still valid when the rendezvous goes away, which is the
    //! "stays valid for as long as it may be queued" half of `send`/`recv`'s contract.
    //!
    //! **The node is on no queue when it is passed.** This is the half that is NOT free, because
    //! several tests reuse one receiver node: it holds only because a `recv` that returns `Signal`
    //! or `FromSender` never queues its argument. Where a site depends on that, its own comment
    //! says so.
