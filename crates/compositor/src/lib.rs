//! **The compositor contract** (milestone 33, the display ladder's rung two).
//!
//! One screen, several mutually distrusting clients, each with its own surface. This crate is the
//! part of that which is arithmetic and can therefore be checked on the host in milliseconds: the
//! scene (which windows exist, where, and in what order they stack), the clipping and
//! damage-rectangle math, the composition itself, and the protocol the parties speak. The prose
//! contract is notes/compositor.md; the processes are `user/src/compositor.rs` (the compositor) and
//! `user/src/window.rs` (a client).
//!
//! The split is the one `gfx_proto` makes for the framebuffer and `line_editor::proto` for the
//! terminal: one definition, shared by the compositor, its clients, the kernel-side test, and the
//! host-side scanout check, so none of them can drift from the others about what the screen should
//! look like.
//!
//! # The shape
//!

//!                   └──the scanout, shared────────┘  └──per-client input endpoint (focus)
//! ```
//!
//! The compositor is **rung one's client, unchanged**: it holds the display endpoint and the scanout
//! frames exactly as `painter` did, and `display` cannot tell the difference. Everything rung two adds
//! is above that seam.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The clipping is where the bugs are, and there are **two clips** because each catches a different
//! one. A client reports damage in its own surface coordinates, and it may lie about them:
//!
//! ```
//! use compositor::{EMPTY, Rect, SCREEN_H, SCREEN_W, Window, damage_to_screen};
//!
//! // A window at (8, 8), 64 by 32.
//! let win = Window::new(8, 8, 64, 32);
//!
//! // Ordinary damage, placed on the screen.
//! assert_eq!(damage_to_screen(&win, Rect::new(4, 5, 9, 7)), Rect::new(12, 13, 9, 7));
//!
//! // Damage past the client's OWN edge. Without the first clip the compositor would read pixels the
//! // client does not own, so it is clipped to the surface before it is placed.
//! let clipped = damage_to_screen(&win, Rect::new(60, 30, 100, 100));
//! assert_eq!(clipped, Rect::new(68, 38, 4, 2));
//!
//! // A window hanging off the left edge, with damage in the part that is off-screen. Without the
//! // second clip the compositor would write outside the framebuffer.
//! let hanging = Window::new(-8, 30, 40, 40);
//! assert_eq!(damage_to_screen(&hanging, Rect::new(0, 0, 4, 4)), EMPTY);
//! // The part that IS on screen survives, starting at x = 0.
//! assert_eq!(damage_to_screen(&hanging, Rect::new(0, 0, 16, 4)), Rect::new(0, 30, 8, 4));
//!
//! // Nothing that comes out of this function can leave the screen.
//! let out = damage_to_screen(&hanging, Rect::new(0, 0, 999, 999));
//! assert!(out.right() <= SCREEN_W as i32 && out.bottom() <= SCREEN_H as i32);
//! ```
//!
//! Composition is checked against an **independent** definition of the finished screen, rather than
//! against itself. [`expected_screen_pixel`] answers "which window owns this pixel" by looking down
//! the stack; [`composite`] builds the same picture the other way round, painting the background and
//! then blitting each window in order. They agree only if both are right:
//!
//! ```
//! use compositor::{
//!     Rect, SCENE, SCREEN_PIXELS, SCREEN_W, background_pixel, composite, expected_screen_pixel,
//!     window_pixel,
//! };
//!
//! // What each client painted into its own surface.

//!                 window_pixel(id as u32, sx, sy)
//!             })
//!             .collect()
//!     })
//!     .collect();
//! let refs: Vec<&[u32]> = surfaces.iter().map(|s| s.as_slice()).collect();
//!

//!     let (x, y) = ((i % SCREEN_W as usize) as u32, (i / SCREEN_W as usize) as u32);
//!     assert_eq!(screen[i], expected_screen_pixel(SCENE.len(), x, y), "pixel ({x}, {y})");
//! }
//!
//! // Stacking order is observable, which is the point of a scene with overlap: window 1 covers part
//! // of window 0, so the topmost one wins.
//! assert_eq!(expected_screen_pixel(2, 45, 30), window_pixel(1, 5, 6));
//! assert_eq!(expected_screen_pixel(1, 45, 30), window_pixel(0, 37, 22));

//! ```
//!
//! # Where authority lives, and why the doorbell can be shared
//!
//! Every client rings **one shared endpoint** and every request on it is content-free: `HELLO` ("I
//! have started") and `COMMIT` ("look at the surfaces"). That is deliberate, and it is the design's
//! load-bearing idea.
//!
//! A shared endpoint carries **no sender identity** (there are no badged capabilities here; DECISIONS
//! §26.5). So a protocol that named a surface, a window, or a rectangle in its *message* would be
//! forgeable: any client could ask about any other's. Instead:
//!
//! - **every per-client fact lives in per-client memory** (the control page in [`proto::ctl`], which
//!   only that client and the compositor map), so the only surface a client can describe is its own,
//!   and the only pixels it can write are its own;
//!
//! - **every privileged answer travels through privileged memory**, never through the reply words. A
//!   screenshot lands in the requester's own capture mapping; the window list is a page the
//!   compositor publishes. A client that holds no such mapping cannot receive the answer even if it
//!   asks, and asking is not how it would get it anyway;
//!
//! - the reply words carry **status only**, and they are routed by the kernel's one-shot Reply
//!   capability, so a request is answered to whoever called without the compositor ever naming a
//!   caller.
//!
//! The result is a compositor with **no authorization code in it at all**. It does not check who may
//! read the screen, because reading the screen is a mapping it does not hand out. That is the
//! difference in kind from Wayland, whose compositor holds every client's connection and decides by
//! policy what each may do. See notes/compositor.md.
//!
//! # What deliberately is NOT here
//!
//! No GPU acceleration (rung four, milestone 34), no fonts or text (rung three), no window
//! management (the scene is fixed; see [`SCENE`]), and no alpha blending: windows are opaque and
//! composition is a copy in stacking order. The honest limits are listed in notes/compositor.md.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `compose`. Refused `compose` (a verb,
//! where the tenet says a namespace is a thing; the crate's own first line already said
//! compositor), `compositor_proto` (promises a wire definition and delivers an algorithm) and
//! `scene` (undersells the clipping and damage arithmetic). Sharing the program's name is the point
//! rather than a collision: the crate is that program's logic, lifted out to be host-testable.

#![no_std]
// milestone 68's ratchet is workspace-wide (§107); this crate opts out until its 19-item
// worklist (notes/doc-coverage.md) is burned down.
