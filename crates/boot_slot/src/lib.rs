//! **Two boot slots, and the rule that stops a bad upgrade bricking the machine.**
//!
//! An installed nife machine keeps two copies of its boot image. An upgrade writes the one that is
//! not running and marks it *on trial*. If the trial image fails to come up, **the machine goes
//! back to the previous one by itself**, with nobody at the console. This crate is the state that
//! makes that true and the policy that reads it; it touches no disk, so the program that writes the
//! state (`components/src/installer.rs`) and the program that acts on it (`uefi_loader`'s chooser)
//! share one implementation rather than two readings of a paragraph.
//!
//! calef ruled on 2026-09-21: *"Yes, write the tries and priority attributes in 2b."*
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-21 by calef, minted the same day by the rung 2b lane. A noun for the thing on the disk,
//! singular like `page_frames`' members and `grant_plan`, rather than for the mechanism over it.
//! Refused `ab_boot`, which is the industry's word for this (A/B partitions) and which says
//! *two* when nothing in here does; refused `boot_slot_attributes`, which names the byte layout
//! rather than the concept and would have to change the day the state moved. `slot` alone was
//! refused as ambiguous in a capability system, where a slot is a place in a cspace. calef names
//! crates; he took this one as minted, and the refusals above are the valuable half of that record.
//!
//! # Where the state lives, and why it is allowed to live there
//!
//! In the **GPT partition entry attribute bits of the slot partitions themselves**. UEFI 2.11
//! section 5.3.3's attribute table says of bits 48 to 63, verbatim:
//!
//! > Reserved for GUID specific use. The use of these bits will vary depending on the
//! > `PartitionTypeGUID`. Only the owner of the `PartitionTypeGUID` is allowed to modify these
//! > bits. They must be preserved if Bits 0-47 are modified.
//!
//! A boot slot's partition type is
//! [`globally_unique_identifier_partition_table::guid::types::NIFE_BOOT`], which is ours, so these
//! sixteen bits are ours by specification and **no other operating system's partition tool will
//! touch them**. That is the whole reason to prefer them to a file: a file in a filesystem is
//! something anything that can mount the volume may rewrite, and the state that decides whether a
//! machine boots should not be.
//!
//! ## The correction that shapes the rest of this crate
//!
//! It is easy to say, and was said on this project, that *firmware* does the selecting. **It does
//! not, and cannot.** ChromeOS is where this design comes from and it gets firmware-level selection
//! because depthcharge is a custom coreboot payload that **replaces** UEFI; its BIOS is a program
//! Google wrote. Generic UEFI firmware, OVMF included, reads bits 48 to 63 of a type it does not
//! own for exactly no purpose: the specification just told it not to. So **the selector has to be
//! ours**, and on a UEFI machine the only code of ours that runs before the kernel is the image at
//! `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI`. That image is therefore the chooser, and the slots are what it chooses
//! between.
//!
//! The other mechanism a reader will reach for is UEFI `Boot####` variables with `BootOrder` and
//! `BootNext`, which firmware genuinely does read, and it was evaluated and refused.
//! Rung 2a of milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install that makes a second customer possible) proved its boot **with the firmware variable store deleted**, on purpose,
//! so that "the firmware found the file on its own" was a claim about the disk rather than about
//! leftovers from a previous run. A rollback design that depends on those variables surviving
//! contradicts the one property that boot was built to demonstrate, and it would also make the
//! state unreadable and unwritable from anywhere but firmware runtime services, which this kernel
//! does not map.
//!
//! # The bit layout, which is a format two programs agree on
//!
//! **Ratified by calef on 2026-09-21** ("Ratify the GUID and bit positions"), and written here
//! because this is where a reader meets it. Before that date it was provisional; it is now a format
//! this project has committed to, and changing it is a decision about disks that already exist. The positions are ChromeOS's own, verified against the ChromiumOS disk-format
//! reference rather than recalled, so that anyone who has run `cgpt show` can read a nife disk:
//!
//! | bits | field | meaning |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 48-51 | [`PRIORITY_SHIFT`] | 0 to 15. **0 means never select this slot.** Higher wins |
//! | 52-55 | [`TRIES_SHIFT`] | 0 to 15. Boot attempts left before the slot is given up on |
//! | 56 | [`SUCCESSFUL_BIT`] | this image has booted and been confirmed; [`State::tries`] stops mattering |
//! | 57-63 | | reserved, written zero, and [`State::into_attributes`] preserves whatever is there |
//!
//! Bits 0 to 47 are the specification's own (`ATTR_REQUIRED` and friends) and are preserved
//! untouched, which is what that table row asks for in its last sentence.
//!
//! # The policy
//!
//! A slot is bootable when its priority is above zero **and** it has either been confirmed or has
//! tries left ([`State::bootable`]). [`select`] returns the bootable slot of highest priority,
//! breaking a tie toward the lower index so that two slots written with the same priority still
//! produce the same boot twice running.
//!
//! **The chooser decrements `tries` before it hands off, not after**, and that is the crux of the
//! whole design rather than a detail. A chooser that only read, leaving the running system to mark
//! itself good once it was up, would protect against an image that *crashes* and not against one
//! that **hangs**: a machine that wedges before userspace would retry the same bad image forever,
//! and the console nobody is standing at would show nothing. Writing first costs a disk write on
//! every trial boot and buys the failure mode that actually strands people. ChromeOS decrements in
//! firmware before the launch for the same reason.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! The life of one upgrade, in the states the disk holds between reboots:
//!
//! ```
//! use boot_slot::{State, select};
//!
//! // After an install: slot 0 holds the image that was just written and is known good.
//! let mut slots = [State::installed(), State::EMPTY];
//! assert_eq!(select(&slots), Some(0));
//!
//! // An upgrade writes slot 1 and puts it on trial, above slot 0.
//! slots[1] = State::on_trial(State::installed().priority + 1, 3);
//! assert_eq!(select(&slots), Some(1));
//!
//! // Three boots that never come up. Each one spends a try BEFORE handing off.
//! for _ in 0..3 {
//!     let chosen = select(&slots).expect("something is always bootable here");
//!     slots[chosen] = slots[chosen].attempted();
//! }
//!
//! // Nobody had to do anything: the machine is back on the image it came with.
//! assert_eq!(select(&slots), Some(0));
//! ```
//!
//! And the same upgrade when it works: something in the booted system calls [`State::confirmed`],
//! and the trial slot stops being a trial.
//!
//! ```
//! # use boot_slot::{State, select};
//! let mut slots = [State::installed(), State::on_trial(3, 3)];
//! slots[1] = select(&slots).map(|i| slots[i].attempted()).unwrap();
//! slots[1] = slots[1].confirmed();
//! assert!(slots[1].successful);
//! assert_eq!(select(&slots), Some(1));
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The bit layout and [`SlotHeader`]'s bytes are ratified, which makes them expensive rather
//!   than safe.** They are a format two programs agree on, which `AGENTS.md` puts in the
//!   irreversible category; calef ratified both on 2026-09-21, so the cost of changing them is now
//!   paid in disks rather than in code. [`SlotHeader`] carries a version field for exactly that
//!   reason, and any future change should use it rather than redefining the bits.
//! - **What confirms a trial boot is a promise, and here is what it can be wrong about.**
//!   `installer`'s `ROLE_CONFIRM` calls [`State::confirmed`] on a running machine once the
//!   filesystem server has mounted the installed disk and reported ready, which is the latest
//!   point this system can reach without a person. So a boot that is confirmed still may not have
//!   exercised **anything the boot path does not touch** (the network stack, the compositor, a
//!   driver for a device nothing opens at boot), has **not reached a shell**, and says nothing
//!   about the seconds after it: a leak, a wedge under load, or a filesystem that mounts and then
//!   corrupts is confirmed and kept. `kernel/src/user/install_service.rs`'s `confirm` argues the
//!   criterion and the milestone block has the rest.
//! - **Nothing in this crate marks a slot successful on its own**, and that is the layering rather
//!   than a gap: this crate touches no disk. The program is `ROLE_CONFIRM` above, and a machine
//!   that never runs it rolls back an upgrade that was working, which fails safe.
//! - **Two slots is not a number this crate enforces.** [`select`] takes a slice of any length and
//!   the policy is the same for three; `installer` lays out two because a third costs a partition
//!   and buys nothing until something can use it.
//! - **Priority is not rotated on exhaustion.** ChromeOS drops an exhausted slot's priority to zero
//!   so that its firmware's plain highest-priority scan moves on. [`select`]'s predicate already
//!   excludes an exhausted slot, so nife does not need the write, and not doing it keeps the
//!   record of what the priorities *were* when the machine last chose. The one place nife does
//!   spend priority is [`State::unreadable`], for a slot whose image will not load at all.
//! - **A slot is 64 MiB of disk that is usually a duplicate.** Two copies of a ten-megabyte boot
//!   image is the price of the property, and it is paid on every installed machine whether or not
//!   it is ever upgraded.

/// | a field in `machine_discovery`'s handoff | a new field in a structure the PVH specification fixes, or a nife-private one beside it, and a second thing for a loader on each of three architectures to fill in |
/// | a module in the `hvm_start_info` module list | the list has two entries and a third would be a page of memory and an entry format, to carry one nibble |
/// | a fixed physical page | a number two programs agree on with nothing checking it, and the one shape this tree has no precedent for |
/// | **a word on the command line** | **one token, one parser, and a host test that round-trips it against the kernel's own reader** |
///
/// **This is a value two programs agree on**, which `AGENTS.md` puts in the expensive category, so
/// the spelling is provisional until calef rules on it. Nothing outside this repository has acted
/// on it, and a machine handed a line it does not understand simply does not confirm, which is the
/// safe direction.
///
/// # The cost worth naming
///
/// The boot command line now has tokens owned by two crates: the screen's are
/// `machine_discovery::framebuffer`'s and this one is here. That split is deliberate (a reader
/// asking what `boot-slot=1` means looks in the crate named after boot slots) and it is a cost: no
/// single place enumerates the line's vocabulary. `uefi_loader::handoff::cmdline` is the writer
/// that sees all of it, and its `CMDLINE_LEN` is the one place the lengths are added up.
///
/// # EXAMPLES
///
/// ```
/// use boot_slot::cmdline;
///
/// let mut out = [0u8; cmdline::MAX_LEN];
/// let n = cmdline::encode(1, &mut out);
/// let line = core::str::from_utf8(&out[..n]).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(line, "boot-slot=1");
/// assert_eq!(cmdline::parse(line), Some(1));
///
/// // Beside the screen, in either order, which is what the kernel actually reads.
/// assert_eq!(cmdline::parse("screen=0x80000000,800,600,3200,bgrx boot-slot=0"), Some(0));
///
/// // A line that says nothing about slots is a boot that was not started by a chooser.
/// assert_eq!(cmdline::parse("screen=0x80000000,800,600,3200,bgrx"), None);
/// ```
