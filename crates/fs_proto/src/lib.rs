//! **The milestone-32 filesystem wire protocols** (notes/fs-server.md).
//!
//! Two userspace protocols, one crate, so the four programs that speak them, the block server, the
//! FS server, the client, and the kernel-side tests, share one definition and cannot drift. The
//! kernel routes these words the way it routes any IPC (§10, §12): it never reads an opcode. Adding
//! one is a change to this crate and the note, not to the syscall surface. This is the same split
//! `line_editor::proto` makes for the terminal contract.
//!
//! # The two protocols
//!
//! ```text
//!   disk ──virtio──►┌──────────────┐──blk IPC──►┌───────────┐──file IPC──► client
//!                   │ block server │            │ FS server │
//!                   └──────────────┘◄───────────└───────────┘◄──────────── (a granted
//!                        (owns the DMA            (owns RedoxFS +            directory cap)
//!                         confinement)             its own heap)
//! ```
//!
//! Nobody names anyone else (endpoint-only naming, notes/ipc-naming.md). The FS server holds "an
//! endpoint I read/write blocks on"; the client holds "an endpoint that opens and reads files under
//! the one directory this endpoint is bound to." Rewire the endpoints and neither side can tell.
//!
//! ## Control by message, bulk by shared page (DECISIONS §10)
//!
//! Both protocols are an endpoint `CALL`: the client sends two words and blocks until the server
//! replies through the one-shot Reply capability the kernel mints. Bulk bytes never ride in the
//! words. They travel in a region the two parties share, one per channel. For blk IPC that region
//! is [`blk::TRANSFER_BLOCKS`] contiguous pages ([`blk::TRANSFER_MAX`] bytes) and holds up to that
//! many filesystem blocks; for file IPC it is [`fs::TRANSFER_PAGES`] contiguous pages
//! ([`fs::TRANSFER_MAX`] bytes) and holds a name (on open) or file data (on read/write).
//!
//! **Both channels were one page until milestone 138**: the file channel through step 3, the blk
//! channel through step 4. Neither change touched the packing; see [`fs::TRANSFER_PAGES`] and
//! [`blk::TRANSFER_BLOCKS`] for what changed and, for the file channel, the one thing it does not
//! check.
//!
//! ## The error boundary
//!
//! Every reply's first word is an [`i64`]: **non-negative is a result, negative is an error**, and
//! the error value is exactly the negated errno ([`reply_err`]). RedoxFS's error type is
//! `syscall::error::Error { errno: i32 }` (the Linux numbers), so the FS server maps it to the wire
//! with `-(err.errno as i64)` at the serve loop and nowhere else, which is the "map the error type
//! once, at the server boundary" rule the roadmap sets. The client reads it back with [`reply_errno`].
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The error boundary is one word wide and has no flag bit, which is what lets a caller read a
//! length and an errno out of the same register without a mode to get wrong:
//!
//! ```
//! use fs_proto::{reply_err, reply_errno};
//!
//! // A READ that moved 4096 bytes, and a READ at end of file. Both are results.
//! assert_eq!(reply_errno(4096), None);
//! assert_eq!(reply_errno(0), None);
//!
//! // ENOENT, mapped once at the server's serve loop and nowhere else.
//! let wire = reply_err(2);
//! assert_eq!(wire, -2);
//! assert_eq!(reply_errno(wire), Some(2));
//! ```
//!
//! A request word packs the opcode, the handle and the length, so control needs no shared page at
//! all: the page is for the bytes.
//!
//! ```
//! use fs_proto::{fs, op};
//!
//! // `read(handle 3, 1024)`.
//! let w0 = fs::req(fs::READ, 3, 1024);
//! assert_eq!(op(w0), fs::READ); // the opcode field is the same one in both protocols
//! assert_eq!(fs::req_handle(w0), 3);
//! assert_eq!(fs::req_len(w0), 1024);
//!
//! // An OPEN sends handle ROOT and the *name's* length; the name itself is in the page.
//! let w0 = fs::req(fs::OPEN, fs::ROOT, b"report.txt".len() as u64);
//! assert_eq!(fs::req_handle(w0), fs::ROOT);
//! assert_eq!(fs::req_len(w0), 10);
//! ```
//!
//! A bulk request is the same word with a bigger length, which is the whole of milestone 138 step
//! 3: sixteen pages in one round trip instead of sixteen round trips, and no new opcode to learn.
//!
//! ```
//! use fs_proto::{PAGE, fs};
//!
//! // The largest read this contract permits, in one request.
//! let w0 = fs::req(fs::READ, 3, fs::TRANSFER_MAX as u64);
//! assert_eq!(fs::req_len(w0), fs::TRANSFER_MAX);
//! assert_eq!(fs::TRANSFER_MAX, fs::TRANSFER_PAGES * PAGE);
//!
//! // A client that shares only the first page keeps working untouched: it asks for one page,
//! // and one page is what the region behind its request has always been.
//! let w0 = fs::req(fs::READ, 3, PAGE as u64);
//! assert_eq!(fs::req_len(w0), PAGE);
//! ```
//!
//! [`dir::Rights`] is where the interesting claim is, and it is a claim about what is **absent**:
//! attenuation is the only way to make a non-root value, and it is a bitwise AND, so no chain of
//! calls can produce a child carrying more than its parent.
//!
//! ```
//! use fs_proto::dir::{self, Rights};
//!
//! // What a shell holds over the user's home directory.
//! let home = Rights::root(dir::ALL);
//!
//! // What it hands a log writer: somewhere to write, and no power to delete what is there.
//! let logs = home.attenuate(dir::READ | dir::WRITE | dir::CREATE);
//! assert!(logs.allows(dir::WRITE));
//! assert!(logs.denies_all(dir::REMOVE));
//!
//! // The log writer passing its authority on cannot widen it back, however it asks.
//! let narrower = logs.attenuate(dir::ALL);
//! assert_eq!(narrower.bits(), logs.bits());
//! assert!(narrower.denies_all(dir::REMOVE));
//! ```
//!
//! And [`grant`] is the shape that makes `run wc report.txt` mean what it says: `wc` is started
//! holding one file, read-only, with the name in two argument words rather than a frame, so a
//! per-file grant costs no extra mapping and the caretaker needs nothing mapped before it runs.
//!
//! ```
//! use fs_proto::grant;
//!
//! assert!(grant::fits(b"report.txt"));
//! let (lo, hi) = grant::pack_name(b"report.txt");
//! let spec = grant::spec(b"report.txt".len(), grant::READ);
//!
//! // What the caretaker unpacks from its three argument words.
//! let mut buf = [0u8; grant::MAX_NAME];
//! let n = grant::unpack_name(lo, hi, grant::spec_len(spec), &mut buf);
//! assert_eq!(&buf[..n], b"report.txt");
//!
//! // A read-only grant is not a policy that could have said yes, so a write gets EROFS.
//! assert!(!grant::writable(spec));
//! assert_eq!(grant::EROFS, 30);
//!
//! // A name too long to travel in two words is refused by the caller, not truncated on the wire.
//! assert!(!grant::fits(b"a-name-longer-than-sixteen-bytes"));
//! ```
//!
//! Name: recorded (milestone 46, and notes/naming.md's crate section). The wire contract was
//! spelled four ways (`fs_proto`, `graphics_proto`, `netproto`, `line_editor::proto`) for one concept;
//! `*_proto` won on 2026-07-30 under DECISIONS §39, and `script/lint` has checked it since. That
//! rule plus the service the stem names produces this name, which is the whole of what `recorded`
//! claims: calef ruled on the rule, and never on this crate.
//! `fs` is this tree's own word for the service, from `fs_server` through `fs_test_client`.

/// - `fs_subtree_caretaker` performs **no checks at all**. One [`fs::OPENDIR`] at startup, the
///   server intersects the rights and mints a restricted handle, and everything afterwards is
///   reached through that handle. This table gives it its shape lookup and nothing else; it consults
///   no policy and no filter, because a branch here is a branch that can be wrong.
/// - `fs_nameset_caretaker` filters names, on **every** verb whose operand is a directory name, and
///   [`verb::Operand::Name`] is what tells it which those are. Before this table that was a
///   hand-listed set of arms, so a new name-taking verb would have arrived **unfiltered**, which is
///   the same failure one class more dangerous.
/// - `fs_file_caretaker` translates between two *protocols*, directory in and file out, so it needs
///   a per-verb answer and has one in [`verb::file_grant::POLICY`]. Its refusals keep their distinct
///   errnos deliberately: [`grant::ENOTDIR`] means the request does not mean anything through a file
///   capability, which is a different statement from a refusal, and flattening the two into
///   "allowed / not allowed" would destroy it.
///

/// - **A wrong row is wrong in three programs at once.** The mitigation is that it is pure data in a
///   host-testable crate, reachable by the tests below and by Kani, which a hand-written match in a
///   `no_std` binary is not.
