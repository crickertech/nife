//! **The notification state machine** (milestone 151 (notification objects), DECISIONS §101 (notification objects)): a data word and a wait
//! queue, and what a signal, a wait and a poll do with them.
//!
//! A notification is the asynchronous half of IPC. A [`Rendezvous`](crate::Rendezvous) is a
//! meeting: a sender blocks until a receiver takes its words. A notification is a doorbell: a
//! signaller ORs bits into a word and never blocks, and a waiter takes whatever has accumulated.
//! Two signals before anyone waits are one wake carrying both sets of bits, which is the point: a
//! notification says *what happened since you last looked*, not *how many times*.
//!
//! It lives in this crate rather than its own because it is the same kind of object as the
//! rendezvous one type over (an intrusive wait queue of TCBs, a decision core the kernel wraps with
//! bookkeeping), and the proofs are the same shape, so they share a harness module and a row in
//! `script/verify`.
//!
//! **The load-bearing invariant is the rendezvous's, restated for a word:** a non-zero word and a
//! non-empty wait queue never coexist. A waiter only queues when the word is zero, and a signal that
//! finds a waiter hands its bits straight to it instead of accumulating them. Every operation is
//! proved to preserve it (the `verification` module below).
//!
//! **The TCB binding is decided here as one boolean and carried out in the kernel.** §101's binding
//! makes a signal wake a thread that is blocked receiving on an *endpoint*, which is state this crate
//! cannot see (it is the kernel's thread table and another object's queue). So [`Notification::signal`]
//! takes `bound_receiving`, "the bound thread is parked in a receive right now", and answers
//! [`Signal::ToBound`] when the kernel should deliver there. What is proved here is that the bits are
//! never lost on any of the three paths; that the kernel reads `bound_receiving` correctly is argued at
//! its call site (`kernel/src/sched.rs`, `signal_locked`).
//!

//! assert_eq!(n.signal(0b01, false), Signal::Counted);
//! assert_eq!(n.signal(0b10, false), Signal::Counted);
