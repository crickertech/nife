//! **The syscall boundary, as a single artifact.**
//!
//! The kernel and every user program depend on this crate, so the ABI is *one thing* rather than
//! two files that agree by luck. If it changes, both sides fail to compile, which is the entire
//! point: a boundary that can drift silently is not a boundary.
//!
//! # The surface is four calls <!--count:syscalls-->, and that is deliberate
//!
//! DECISIONS §4 rule 3: *the syscall surface stays narrow and explicit. It is a boundary, not
//! a habit.* And §10 chose capabilities, which is what makes so few enough:
//!
//! ```text
//!   exit(code)                              you always have authority over yourself
//!   yield()                                 likewise
//!   cap_delete(slot)                        likewise: your own capability table is your own
//!   invoke(cap, method, a0, a1, a2)         EVERYTHING ELSE
//! ```
//!
//! There is no `open`. No `read`. No `write`. No `fork`. **A process can only act on things it
//! was handed**, and `invoke` is how it acts on them.
//!
//! `exit`, `yield` and `cap_delete` are plain syscalls rather than invocations on a TCB
//! capability, and the reason is worth stating: **a capability is authority over something
//! *else*.** You do not need to be granted the right to stop running, or to be granted the right
//! to make your own capability table forget something.
//!
//! **So three of the four are authority over yourself and the fourth is everything else**, which
//! is the shape that matters rather than the number. This header said "three calls" from
//! 2026-07-14 until the 2026-08-17 documentation sweep found it, because
//! [`SYS_CAP_DELETE`] arrived on 2026-07-24 (milestone 19d) and nothing brought the summary with
//! it. The count now carries a `<!--count:syscalls-->` marker, so `script/lint` re-derives it from
//! the constants below and a fifth call cannot land without this sentence moving. See
//! notes/counted-claims.md.
//!
//! # The register convention
//!
//! ```text
//!   x8  syscall number
//!   x0  capability slot        (for invoke)
//!   x1  method
//!   x2  arg0
//!   x3  arg1
//!   x4  arg2
//!
//!   x0  return: >= 0 is a result, < 0 is an `Error`
//! ```
//!
//! `x8` for the number is Linux's aarch64 convention, and there is no reason to be different.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A return value carries both a result and an error in one register, with no flag bit, because the
//! error space is a handful of small negatives and no result is ever negative:
//!
//! ```
//! use abi::Error;
//!
//! // A successful `invoke` returning a handle, a count, or nothing.
//! assert_eq!(Error::from_ret(0), None);
//! assert_eq!(Error::from_ret(4096), None);
//!
//! // A refusal, decoded on the userspace side of the boundary.
//! assert_eq!(Error::from_ret(-1), Some(Error::NoSuchSlot));
//! assert_eq!(Error::from_ret(-4), Some(Error::BadPointer));
//!
//! // A number that is not one of the kernel's errors is not decoded as one. That is what lets a
//! // wire contract layered on top (`entropy_protocol`, `credential_protocol`) tell "no capability" from "no".
//! assert_eq!(Error::from_ret(-99), None);
//! ```
//!
//! Two pairs of variants exist because the difference is load-bearing rather than descriptive, and
//! that is the part of this crate worth reading twice:
//!
//! ```
//! use abi::Error;
//!
//! // "There is nothing there" and "there was something there and it is gone" are different facts,
//! // and a writer branches on them in **opposite** directions: a program never granted a stdout
//! // keeps running and prints into the void; a program whose reader has exited must end. Both used
//! // to arrive as NoSuchSlot, so the only available behaviour was the wrong one for a pipeline.
//! assert_ne!(Error::NoSuchSlot, Error::Gone);
//! assert_eq!(Error::NoSuchSlot as i64, -1);
//! assert_eq!(Error::Gone as i64, -11);
//!
//! // And the one that is deliberately NOT split: "gone" and "not yours" are one error, because
//! // telling them apart would let a supervisor probe the tid space of children it has no
//! // relationship with. `Gone` can be told apart for the opposite reason: the capability is
//! // already in the caller's own capability table, so its death reveals nothing new.
//! assert_eq!(Error::NotSupervised as i64, -10);
//! ```
//!
//! The surface itself is three numbers, and everything else is a method on a capability:
//!
//! ```
//! use abi::{SYS_EXIT, SYS_INVOKE, SYS_YIELD, rendezvous};
//!
//! assert_eq!([SYS_EXIT, SYS_YIELD, SYS_INVOKE], [0, 1, 2]);
//!
//! // Sending on a rendezvous is a method number, not a syscall number. Adding an operation to the
//! // system is a new method here; adding a *syscall* is a design fork (DECISIONS §10, §16).
//! assert_eq!(rendezvous::SEND, 0);
//! ```
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review). Considered and
//! declined: `application_binary_interface`, spelled out fully to match this session's other
//! renames -- rejected on the actual test (does the architect have to ask what this means, which
//! sank `Tcb`/`Aspace`/`Untyped`, the abbreviations these renames replaced), not on effort. "ABI"
//! is closer to "CPU" than to "TCB" on that
//! scale, and this is the tree's single most-imported crate, so the ergonomic cost of spelling it
//! out would have been the highest of any rename this pass. Sits in the tenet's protected group
//! (`elf`, `pci`, `dtb`, `gpt`, `ipc`, `paging`, `glob`, `asid`) for the same reason those do.
//! Introduced 2026-07-14 with milestone 7d's first three syscalls.
