//! **Credentials: an identity, and a secret you can check but never read back**
//! (milestone 56, the credential half; notes/credentials.md).
//!
//! The pure logic behind the credential service: how a secret becomes a record, how a presented
//! secret is checked against one, and how a record is encoded. No syscalls, no allocation, no
//! `alloc`, so it compiles for the host and for both bare-metal targets from one source and its
//! tests run in milliseconds. The wire contract is `credential_proto`; the service is
//! `user/src/credentialer.rs`.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Provisioning two people and then checking a login. The cost here is a deliberately cheap one so
//! the example runs in milliseconds; [`Cost::DEFAULT`] is what the service wires, and the parameters
//! travel in the record rather than being compiled in, so raising them is a provisioning change.
//!
//! ```
//! use cred::{Block, Cost, SALT_LEN, Store, TAG_LEN, Verdict};
//!
//! let cost = Cost::new(64, 1, 1).expect("a cheap cost, for the example only");
//! let mut scratch: Vec<Block> = vec![Block::new(); cost.blocks()];
//!
//! // The decoy salt and tag must both come from the entropy service: a decoy tag of zeros would be
//! // one an attacker could aim a preimage at.
//! let mut store: Store<3> = Store::new(cost, [7u8; SALT_LEN], [9u8; TAG_LEN]);
//!
//! // Each salt is per-identity and unpredictable. Nothing in this crate invents one, because a salt
//! // a caller chose is a salt an attacker may have chosen too.
//! store.put(b"corinne", b"battery staple", [1u8; SALT_LEN], &mut scratch).unwrap();
//! store.put(b"calef", b"correct horse", [2u8; SALT_LEN], &mut scratch).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(store.len(), 2);
//!
//! assert_eq!(store.verify(b"calef", b"correct horse", &mut scratch).unwrap(), Verdict::Match);
//!
//! // **A wrong secret and an identity nobody provisioned are the same answer.** Distinguishing them
//! // would make this an identity oracle: ask about a thousand names and learn which three exist.
//! // The store also spends the same work on both, so the timing does not distinguish them either.
//! assert_eq!(store.verify(b"calef", b"hunter2", &mut scratch).unwrap(), Verdict::Mismatch);
//! assert_eq!(store.verify(b"graeme", b"anything", &mut scratch).unwrap(), Verdict::Mismatch);
//! ```
//!
//! There is no read path, and that is a property of the API rather than of anyone's discipline: a
//! [`Record`] can be encoded and decoded, and what comes out the other side is still a tag.
//!
//! ```
//! use cred::{Block, Cost, Record, SALT_LEN};
//!
//! let cost = Cost::new(64, 1, 1).unwrap();
//! let mut scratch: Vec<Block> = vec![Block::new(); cost.blocks()];
//!
//! let rec = Record::derive(b"calef", b"correct horse", [2u8; SALT_LEN], cost, &mut scratch).unwrap();
//! let bytes = rec.encode();
//!
//! // A round trip preserves the record exactly, which is what makes the sealed store loadable.
//! let back = Record::decode(&bytes).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(back.identity(), b"calef");
//! assert_eq!(back.cost(), cost);
//!
//! // And the encoded form does not contain the secret, in any form: recovering it means finding a
//! // preimage, which is the guessing attack the cost parameters exist to price.
//! assert!(!bytes.windows(13).any(|w| w == b"correct horse"));
//! ```
//!
//! A cost that Argon2 will not accept is refused where it is *written*, rather than at the
//! derivation that would have used it:
//!
//! ```
//! use cred::Cost;
//!
//! assert!(Cost::new(4096, 3, 1).is_some());
//! assert!(Cost::new(0, 3, 1).is_none()); // no memory is not a memory-hard KDF
//! assert!(Cost::new(Cost::MAX_M_KIB + 1, 3, 1).is_none()); // past a gibibyte is a typo, not a policy
//! ```
//!
//! # What is stored, and why it cannot be turned back into a password
//!
//! A [`Record`] is an identity, a random 16-byte salt, three cost parameters, and a 32-byte
//! **Argon2id** tag. The tag is `Argon2id(secret, salt, cost)`. There is no key, no cipher, and
//! nothing to decrypt: recovering the secret means finding a preimage, which is the guessing
//! attack the memory-hard cost parameters exist to price.
//!
//! ## Why Argon2id, and why a dependency rather than our own
//!
//! DECISIONS §46 draws the line at *exposure*: write the thing whose correctness you can argue
//! from the spec, depend on the thing whose correctness is won by many eyes and many years against
//! published test vectors. A password KDF is squarely the second. So this crate depends on
//! **RustCrypto's `argon2`**, and the tests below are the **reference implementation's and RFC
//! 9106's own known-answer vectors**, run against the version we actually link. If a future bump
//! changes an answer, these fail.
//!
//! Argon2id specifically, rather than Argon2i or Argon2d: it is the RFC 9106 §4 recommendation,
//! it is what OWASP puts first, and it is the variant that resists both a side-channel adversary
//! (the Argon2i half) and a time-memory tradeoff (the Argon2d half). scrypt and PBKDF2 were the
//! alternatives; PBKDF2 is not memory-hard at all, and scrypt is the older answer to the same
//! question with no advantage here.
//!
//! # Three things this crate does that a naive verifier would not
//!
//! 1. **The tag comparison is constant-time** ([`subtle`]). A verifier that returned early on the
//!    first differing byte would let an attacker recover the tag one byte at a time.
//! 2. **The identity lookup is constant-time too**, and does not stop at the match. A scan that
//!    short-circuited would leak *which* identities exist, which is the same oracle by a slower
//!    route.
//! 3. **An identity that is not in the store still costs one full derivation**, against a decoy
//!    record whose salt and tag come from the entropy service. Without that, "no such user"
//!    returns in microseconds and "wrong password" returns in milliseconds, and the store's
//!    membership is readable from a stopwatch.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! No persistence. A [`Store`] is memory only, and everything in it dies with the process; the
//! secrets-at-rest question is open and notes/credentials.md says so plainly rather than implying
//! a durability we do not have. No rehash-on-verify when the cost parameters move. No lockout, no
//! rate limit, no attempt counting; the service that owns the store is the only thing that could
//! enforce those and it does not.
//!
//! Name: provisional, and this lane proposes a rename to `credential`. Introduced 2026-07-31 with
//! milestone 56. The history says only that, and the one entry that carries a reason is
//! `script/lint`'s `-d` allow-list, written by the lane that needed the exemption. Everything
//! else in the tree has moved the other way, twice, by calef's own hand: milestone 63 spelled the
//! service `credentialer` in full on 2026-08-01, and on 2026-08-23 he renamed `cred_proto` to
//! `credential_proto` with the reason recorded as "spell out the contraction fully". This crate
//! is that same contraction, left behind by both sweeps rather than exempted from either, so the
//! tree now spells one word two ways across three things that are the same thing. `kbd` to
//! `keyboard_driver` on 2026-08-27 is the same shape. The seventh question, asked plainly: if
//! renaming and keeping cost the same, nothing would keep this name, so the only argument for it
//! is effort, and it is stated here as effort rather than dressed as judgment. Proposed, not
//! performed.
