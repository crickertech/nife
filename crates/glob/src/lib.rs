//! **glob: does this pattern match this name?** (milestone 47, the navigation-and-naming lane).
//!
//! A pattern and a name go in, a `bool` comes out. That is the whole crate. It performs no IO,
//! makes no syscalls, reads no directory, allocates nothing, and holds no capability. It does not
//! know what a file is.
//!
//! That narrowness is the point rather than an accident of scheduling. Milestone 47's finding is
//! that the interesting question about globbing here is not *how to match*, which is a solved
//! problem with fifty years of prior art, but **what a match grants**: `rm *.txt` with five hundred
//! hits must convey exactly those five hundred files and nothing else, which the roadmap answers
//! with an `fs_file_caretaker` attenuated to a **name set** rather than a directory capability.
//! That wiring needs the directory-capability verb and the shell's expansion path, and it is a
//! different lane. What is left over is exactly this: a total function on two byte strings, which
//! is the part that can be machine-checked.
//!
//! The property the rest of the milestone wants from this crate is small and worth stating: **the
//! expansion you see is the grant.** `echo *.txt` prints literally the authority `rm *.txt` would
//! transfer, because the matched set *is* the namespace the caretaker will serve. That only means
//! anything if the matcher is the same matcher in both places and cannot be talked into a different
//! answer, so it lives here, once, with proofs.
//!
//! DECISIONS §46 rule 1 is why it is written rather than depended on: it is on the verification
//! path, and you cannot restructure someone else's crate to make a model checker tractable.
//!
//! # What a pattern is
//!
//! | syntax | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `*` | any run of bytes, including none |
//! | `?` | exactly one byte |
//! | `[abc]` | one byte from the set |
//! | `[a-z]` | one byte from the inclusive range |
//! | `[!abc]`, `[^abc]` | one byte *not* in the set |
//! | `\x` | the byte `x`, with no special meaning |
//! | anything else | itself |
//!
//! Everything is **bytes**, not characters. A name on this system is a byte string
//! (`filesystem_proto::grant::MAX_NAME` is sixteen of them), and a matcher that decoded UTF-8 would have to
//! decide what to do with a name that is not valid UTF-8, which is a question the filesystem does
//! not ask. `?` therefore matches one *byte*, so it matches half of a two-byte UTF-8 character. That
//! is the same behaviour as `fnmatch(3)` in the C locale and as every shell running under it.
//!
//! # There is no error case
//!
//! [`matches()`] is total and infallible. There is no `Result`, because there is no malformed
//! pattern: a `[` with no closing `]` is a literal `[`, and a trailing `\` is a literal `\`. Both
//! follow `fnmatch(3)` and bash, and both matter here for a reason beyond compatibility. A pattern
//! is untrusted input, typed by a person or produced by a program, and the alternative to "it means
//! itself" is an error path in the shell's grant planner for every typo. `ls [foo` should list the
//! file called `[foo` if there is one, which is what it does.
//!
//! # A leading dot, and why the default is the smaller grant
//!
//! By default (`Dot::Special`, what [`matches()`] uses) a name beginning with `.` is matched only by a
//! pattern beginning with a literal `.`. So `*` does not match `.config`, and neither does `?` match
//! `.`, and neither does `[.]config`, which is glibc's rule for `FNM_PERIOD` exactly. Pass
//! [`Dot::Ordinary`] to [`matches_with`] to turn the rule off.
//!
//! This is a *policy*, not a matching fact, and in fnmatch it is a flag for that reason. It is the
//! default here because of what a match means in this system: `rm *` hands the child authority over
//! everything it matched, so the default should be the interpretation that grants less. A user who
//! wants the dotfiles asks for them by name, and gets the larger grant deliberately.
//!
//! # `**` is not here, and that is a decision
//!
//! Recursive descent (`**/*.rs`) is **out of scope for this crate, permanently, not "not yet".** Two
//! reasons, and the second is the real one.
//!
//! - **It needs a path separator, and the matcher still has no business owning one.** Milestone 47
//!   settled the syntax on 2026-08-18 and it settled it Plan 9's way: a path is resolved in the
//!   client, `/` is the root of the holder's own namespace, and the FS server still sees one
//!   component per request. That answers the question this bullet was waiting on and does not
//!   change the answer, because the resolution lives in `grant_plan::nav` and in the `std` PAL,
//!   both of which walk components against capabilities. A matcher that also split paths would be
//!   a second, unauthorised resolver.
//! - **`**` is not a matching feature. It is a traversal feature.** `*` says "consider these bytes";
//!   `**` says "and also descend into that directory, and the one below it". Descending means
//!   opening a subdirectory, which in this system means holding a capability for it, which is
//!   enumeration and granting. Putting `**` in a string matcher hides an authority question inside
//!   a pure function, which is the exact mistake this OS exists to not make.
//!
//! So this crate matches **one name**, a single path component, the thing `filesystem_proto` actually
//! carries. When path syntax is settled, recursive descent lands as a traversal layer *above* this
//! crate, walking directory capabilities and calling [`matches()`] per component. That layer is where
//! `**` belongs, because that is where the authority to descend is.
//!
//! **The honest cost, stated where you meet it:** nothing here treats `/` as special. Hand
//! [`matches()`] a whole path and `*` will happily match across separators, because to this crate a
//! `/` is a byte like any other. That is a caller error, not a mode. The type system cannot catch it
//! while a name is `&[u8]`, so it is written down instead.
//!
//! # Glob qualifiers are out of scope, and the reason is authority
//!
//! zsh's qualifiers are the best thing in its glob engine (`*(.)` for regular files, `*(om[1])` for
//! the newest, `*(Lm+1)` for over a megabyte) and none of them are here. The roadmap says to settle
//! this **before** building the matcher around them, so: settled, out, and this crate is not built
//! around them.
//!
//! It is not squeamishness about scope. A qualifier needs type, mtime and size **per candidate**, so
//! one `enumerate` becomes N `FSTAT` calls and needs a **read right beyond enumerate**. That turns
//! `echo *(.)`, which reads like a display, into an operation that requires more authority than
//! listing the directory. In a capability system that is a change to what the command is, not a
//! feature flag. If qualifiers ever arrive they arrive as a separate, visible step over an already
//! enumerated set, with the extra right named, and the matcher stays a function of two byte strings.
//!
//! POSIX character classes (`[[:alpha:]]`) are out for a smaller reason: the inner `[:` and `:]` are
//! not syntax here, so `[[:alpha:]]` parses as the class `[[:alpha:]` (members `[`, `:`, `a`, `l`,
//! `p`, `h`) followed by a literal `]`, and matches the two-byte names `[]`, `:]`, `a]`, `l]`, `p]`
//! and `h]`. Locale-dependent classes have no meaning on a system with no locale, and a wrong answer
//! that is quiet is worse than a missing feature, so it is written down here and pinned by a test.
//!
//! # Why it cannot be made to hang
//!
//! A pattern is untrusted input, so "pathological pattern makes the shell stop responding" is a
//! denial of service, not a performance note. The classic way to earn one is the recursive matcher
//! everybody writes first: `a*a*a*a*b` against a long run of `a` makes it try every way of splitting
//! the run between the stars, which is exponential.
//!
//! This matcher does not backtrack that way. It keeps **one** backtrack point, the most recent `*`,
//! and on a mismatch retries with that `*` absorbing one more byte. A later `*` overwrites the
//! saved one, because anything an earlier `*` could have absorbed a later one can absorb instead.
//! The consequence is that the retry position advances monotonically and never resets: at most
//! `name.len() + 1` retries, each costing at most one pass over the pattern.
//!
//! That bound is not left as prose. [`cost_bound`] computes it from the two lengths alone, before
//! any matching happens, and [`match_steps`] reports what a match actually cost. Kani proves
//! `match_steps(..).1 <= cost_bound(..)` over arbitrary short inputs, which is what says the
//! accounting is sound; a host test then runs the exponential-shaped pattern against a hundred
//! thousand bytes and checks the same inequality, which is what says the matcher is. A caller that
//! wants to refuse an expensive pattern before running it can ask [`cost_bound`] and never start.
//!

//!
//! // A malformed pattern is a literal, not an error.
//! assert!(matches(b"[foo", b"[foo"));
//!
//! // The shell asks two questions of a word: is it a pattern at all, and if not, what name is it?
//! assert!(has_magic(b"*.txt"));
//! assert!(!has_magic(br"a\*b"));
//! let mut buf = [0u8; 16];
//! assert_eq!(literal(br"a\*b", &mut buf), Some(&b"a*b"[..]));
//! assert_eq!(literal(b"*.txt", &mut buf), None); // it has magic; expand it instead
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use glob::{matches, has_magic};
//!
//! assert!(matches(b"*.rs", b"main.rs"));
//! assert!(!matches(b"*.rs", b"main.c"));
//! assert!(matches(b"src/?????.rs", b"src/hello.rs"));
//! assert!(matches(b"[abc]at", b"cat"));
//!
//! // A pattern with no metacharacters is just a name, which callers use to skip the walk.
//! assert!(has_magic(b"*.rs"));
//! assert!(!has_magic(b"Cargo.toml"));
//! ```
//!
//! A leading dot is special, the way a shell user expects, and [`matches_with`] is how you opt out:
//!
//! ```
//! use glob::{matches, matches_with, Dot};
//!
//! assert!(!matches(b"*", b".config"));                       // `*` does not list dotfiles
//! assert!(matches(b".*", b".config"));                       // an explicit dot does
//! assert!(matches_with(b"*", b".config", Dot::Ordinary));    // ... unless you ask otherwise
//! ```

    /// This is also the harness that quantifies over the four- and five-byte class forms the
    /// three-byte domain above cannot reach, so a panic in `[!...]` or in a range would fail here.

    /// **Three assumptions, and Kani found the need for the third.** Writing this without excluding
    /// `!` and `^` at the head of the body failed in 42 seconds with a counterexample, and the
    /// counterexample is correct: `[!y]` is not "the class of `!` and `y`", it is *already* a negated
    /// class, so `[!!y]` is its complement rather than its double. The other two exclude bodies that
    /// close early (`]`) or escape (`\`), which make the two spellings different patterns rather than
    /// one pattern and its negation. All three are about what the two spellings *are*; bracket
    /// parsing itself is quantified over without restriction by the totality harness above.
