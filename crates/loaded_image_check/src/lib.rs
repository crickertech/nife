//! **A program proving its own ELF image was loaded correctly**, using nothing but its own memory.
//!
//! None of this needs a capability: every byte it reads belongs to the process already. That is
//! what makes it the first thing a new loader can be tested with, and it is why the milestone-7
//! test spawns the self-checker with no authority at all.
//!
//! # What each check would catch
//!
//! - `.rodata` holds the bytes the file said it did, so the read-only segment was mapped from the
//!   file rather than zeroed.
//! - `.data` holds its initialiser **and** is writable, so the loader copied it rather than
//!   pointing at the file's pages read-only.
//! - `.bss` reads zero before anything writes it. Nobody else would catch this: those bytes are
//!   not in the file, so a loader that forgot them would leave whatever the frame allocator handed
//!   over, and every value it could hold is a value some program is happy with.
//! - The stack survives eight frames of recursion, so `sp` was set to real, writable memory with
//!   room under it.
//!
//! # How it says no
//!
//! It traps. A failed check must be indistinguishable from a broken program, because it *is* one,
//! and a program whose loader is broken has no reliable way to report anything: the endpoint it
//! would report on may not be mapped either. The kernel turns the trap into a fault and kills the
//! thread, which the test counts.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The whole of a self-checking program:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
//! pub extern "C" fn _start(_a: u64, _b: u64, _c: u64) -> ! {
//!     loaded_image_check::verify(user_mode_runtime::trap);
//!     user_mode_runtime::exit();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! **`fail` is a parameter rather than a call into `user_mode_runtime`**, and that is what keeps this crate
//! host-buildable. A crate that reaches `user_mode_runtime` reaches EL0 syscall `asm!` and compiles for
//! aarch64 or riscv64 only, which would put this in four separate host-pass exclusion lists to buy
//! one function call. The caller already has the right way for *it* to die, and hands it over.
//!
//! # Bugs
//!
//! **The markers are `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]` statics, so exactly one copy of this crate may be
//! linked into a binary.** Two would be a duplicate symbol at link time rather than a silent
//! wrong answer, which is the failure mode to prefer, but it does mean this crate cannot be a
//! transitive dependency of something a program also depends on directly.
//!
//! **It cannot check the executable segment.** A program that is running has already proven its
//! `.text` was mapped, so there is nothing left for a marker to say; a loader that mapped `.text`
//! writable would pass every check here and DECISIONS §10's `W^X` assertions in
//! `kernel/src/user/tests.rs` are what catch that instead.
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-14 (calef, working the unratified worklist). A program's check that its
//! own ELF image was loaded correctly.
//!
//! **Ratified after reading the prior art rather than recalling it, and the field offers nothing to
//! defer to.** Searched 2026-09-14: everything published about verifying ELF sections is
//! *loader-side*, a loader sanity-checking magic bytes, header size and segment bounds before it
//! maps anything, and handling the `p_filesz`/`p_memsz` gap by zero-filling. This crate is the
//! inverse: it runs **inside** the loaded program and audits what the loader already did to it. The
//! one named convention nearby is Linux's `kselftest`, which is a suite run against a built kernel
//! rather than a program auditing its own image. And `POST` is spoken for, as milestone 268's block
//! established from `notes/xenon-firmware.md`'s quotation of Dell's Power On Self-Test.
//!
//! So this is **coined, not standard**, and claims none of the shelter `virtio` and `elf` get from
//! being the field's own word. That also sharpens the `self_check` refusal below: beyond `self`
//! naming the caller, `selftest` and `self-check` mean *a system testing itself* in this field,
//! where this program verifies **someone else's work on it**. `loaded_` earns its place. It is a crate because two fixtures need it and AGENTS.md rule 7 admits no `#[path]`
//! module; it was `hello`'s `self_check()` while the self-checker and the printing client were two
//! roles of one binary. Refused `self_check` (a verb phrase, and `self` names the caller rather
//! than the thing checked, which reads oddly at `self_check::verify()`). Refused `image_check`
//! ("image" is this tree's word for a disk image as often as for a loaded program:
//! `target/nifefs.img`, `uefi-image`). Refused putting it in `crates/user_mode_runtime` (`user_mode_runtime` is what
//! every program links to reach the kernel, and a diagnostic nothing in a running system calls does
//! not belong in that surface; and a crate that depends on it cannot build for the host).
