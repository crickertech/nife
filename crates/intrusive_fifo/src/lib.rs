//! An intrusive FIFO queue: **the link lives inside the node.**
//!
//! Milestone 14 phase A.2 (design/kernel-objects-from-untyped.md, decision D1). The per-CPU run
//! queues and migration inboxes used to be `VecDeque<Tid>`: every entry was heap-backed, pushing
//! could allocate (which is why the scheduler pre-reserved capacity, a standing apology to the
//! IRQ path), and every pop handed back a number that still had to be looked up.
//!
//! An intrusive queue stores nothing. The "next" pointer lives inside the thing being queued,
//! and the queue itself is two pointers, head and tail. Push and pop are a couple of pointer
//! writes, they cannot allocate and cannot fail, and what a pop hands back is the object itself.
//! This is what every kernel we learn from does (Linux `list_head`, seL4's TCB queues), for
//! exactly these reasons.
//!
//! # The price, stated plainly
//!
//! **One link means one queue.** A node can be on at most one `Fifo` at a time, because there is
//! only one `next` inside it. For a scheduler this is not a restriction, it is the *invariant*:
//! a thread is ready on one core's queue, or parked in one inbox, or blocked on one endpoint, or
//! running, and never two of those at once. The queue makes the state machine physical.
//!
//! **And the compiler cannot check it.** A `VecDeque` owns its entries; this queue borrows its
//! nodes with no lifetime the borrow checker can see. The rules the caller must keep (below) are
//! enforced by discipline and stated invariants, which is why the mutating half of the API is
//! `unsafe`. The queue is memory the caller owns, threaded through itself.
//!
//! # The caller's contract
//!
//! 1. A node is pushed onto at most one queue, and not pushed again until popped.
//! 2. A node outlives its time on the queue (the kernel: a queued thread is `Ready`, and only
//!    `Finished` threads are ever freed).
//! 3. All access to a queue and its nodes' links is serialized by the caller (the kernel: a run
//!    queue is single-core with interrupts masked; an inbox is behind its mutex).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A run queue, with the three contract rules visible in the code rather than only in the list
//! above. Note where the nodes are declared: **before** the queue, so they outlive it, because
//! locals drop in reverse and rule 2 is otherwise nothing but a promise.
//!
//! ```
//! use core::ptr::NonNull;
//! use intrusive_fifo::{Fifo, Node};
//!
//! struct Thread {
//!     tid: u32,
//!     next: Option<NonNull<Thread>>,
//! }
//!
//! // SAFETY: `next` and `set_next` are plain field storage and touch nothing else, which is the
//! // whole of the `Node` contract. A clever implementation here is a corrupted queue.
//! unsafe impl Node for Thread {
//!     fn next(&self) -> Option<NonNull<Self>> {
//!         self.next
//!     }
//!     fn set_next(&mut self, next: Option<NonNull<Self>>) {
//!         self.next = next;
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Rule 2, as drop order: these outlive `q`.
//! let mut a = Thread { tid: 1, next: None };
//! let mut b = Thread { tid: 2, next: None };
//! let mut q: Fifo<Thread> = Fifo::new();
//!
//! // SAFETY: both are live locals declared before `q`, and neither is on a queue (rule 1). This
//! // doctest is the only accessor, which is rule 3.
//! unsafe {
//!     q.push_back(NonNull::from(&mut a));
//!     q.push_back(NonNull::from(&mut b));
//! }
//! assert_eq!(q.len(), 2);
//! assert!(!q.is_empty());
//!
//! // Round robin: threads leave in the order they arrived, and a pop hands back the object rather
//! // than a number somebody has to look up.
//! // SAFETY: each popped pointer is one of the live locals above, and is no longer linked.
//! let order: Vec<u32> = core::iter::from_fn(|| q.pop_front())
//!     .map(|p| unsafe { (*p.as_ptr()).tid })
//!     .collect();
//! assert_eq!(order, vec![1, 2]);
//! assert!(q.is_empty());
//!
//! // A drained queue takes new nodes correctly, which is where the classic tail-pointer bug lives.
//! // SAFETY: as above; `a` was popped, so it is on no queue again.
//! unsafe { q.push_back(NonNull::from(&mut a)) };
//! assert_eq!(q.len(), 1);
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing in the type system stops the next line from being written, and it is the whole reason the
//! mutating half of this API is `unsafe`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Rule 1 broken. One link per node means `b` is now on both queues and neither is correct;
//! // the second push silently rewrites the link the first one made. No tool in this tree catches
//! // it, which is what the section below is honest about.
//! unsafe { ready.push_back(NonNull::from(&mut b)) };
//! unsafe { inbox.push_back(NonNull::from(&mut b)) };
//! ```
//!
//! # What a static analyser sees here, and why it is right (DECISIONS §35)
//!
//! CodeQL flagged the dereferences in [`Fifo::push_back`] and [`Fifo::pop_front`] as
//! `rust/access-invalid-pointer`. **Both alerts are now fixed rather than dismissed**, and the
//! measurement is worth recording because the expectation was wrong: the rule reads as being about
//! pointer validity in general, so the prediction was that moving to [`NonNull`] would improve the
//! code without satisfying the tool. It satisfied the tool outright, main going from two open alerts
//! to zero on this change (`/language:rust`: 2 results on `refs/heads/main`, 0 on `refs/pull/5/head`).
//! The rule was more precise than it looked, and it was pointing at nullness.
//!
//! **Nullness is gone from the contract**: the API takes and returns [`NonNull`], and every caller
//! converts from a reference (`NonNull::from`, never `NonNull::new(..).unwrap()`), so non-nullness is
//! a fact of construction rather than a promise anyone keeps.
//!
//! **Validity is still not expressible**, and no tool result changes that. Rule 2 above says a node outlives its
//! time on the queue, and no type available to us can carry that for a structure whose entire purpose
//! is that the queue does *not* own its nodes. What upholds it is the kernel's state machine: only
//! `Finished` threads are ever freed, a `Finished` thread is on no queue, and one link per node makes
//! "on at most one queue" physical rather than remembered.
//!
//! So the honest statement is that **this queue is safe because its callers are correct, and nothing
//! in this crate can check that**. The Kani harness below proves the FIFO's *logic* over a symbolic
//! operation sequence against nodes it holds valid by construction; it answers "is the ordering
//! right", never "did a caller free a queued node". Neither tool covers that, and a reader should
//! know it rather than infer safety from two green checkmarks.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review). Renamed from
//! `intrusive`: a bare adjective without its noun; the primary type is `Fifo<T: Node>`, and
//! "intrusive" describes a *style* of data structure, not a thing on its own. The term itself is
//! still grounded in the prior art this project learns from, Linux's `list_head` and seL4's TCB
//! queues; only the missing noun was the defect. Introduced 2026-07-23 when the run queues and
//! inboxes went intrusive.
