//! **Quoting: what a word is, and therefore what a command designates** (milestone 67,
//! notes/swish-language.md).
//!
//! Before this module a word was "bytes up to the next space", so a file called `my notes.txt` was
//! **unnameable**, and in a shell whose whole thesis is that naming a resource is granting it, a
//! resource you cannot name is a resource you cannot grant. That is why quoting lands here rather
//! than in a polish milestone: the gap was in the authority surface, not in the ergonomics.
//!
//! # Quoting delimits a word. It never rewrites one.
//!
//! Every token in this shell is a **slice of the line you typed**. Nothing is copied and nothing is
//! reassembled, which is what lets a shell with no allocator hand a name straight to the grant
//! planner, and it is why `line::split` can keep a stage's command text as a slice rather than
//! rebuilding it (notes/pipes.md).
//!
//! A backslash escape would have to *remove* a byte from the middle of a word, and a word with a
//! byte removed is not a slice of anything. So:
//!
//! - `'...'` and `"..."` **wrap a whole word**, and the word is the span between them.
//! - There is **no backslash escape**. A `\` is an ordinary byte in a name.
//! - Two quoted pieces are **not joined**. `a"b c"d` is [`Refusal::PartlyQuoted`], because joining
//!   is the one thing a slice cannot do.
//!
//! The property that buys is worth the corner it costs: **what is between the quotes is exactly
//! what is designated, byte for byte.** There is no rewriting step between what you typed and what
//! moves, so a preview (`caps`, `echo`) and a grant cannot disagree about what a name is.
//!
//! # What quoting does and does not change about authority
//!
//! It changes **what is designated**, and that is all:
//!
//! - It changes a word's boundaries, so a name with a space, a `>` or a `|` in it can be named at
//!   all. That is new authority only in the sense that a resource you could not name was a resource
//!   you could not grant.
//! - It **suppresses pattern expansion**, so `rm "*.txt"` designates one name spelled `*.txt` and
//!   `rm *.txt` designates the set. That is a *narrowing*, and it is visible before anything moves:
//!   `echo "*.txt"` and `echo *.txt` print what each would hand over.
//!
//! It changes nothing else. There is no quoting form that widens a grant, none that reaches a
//! capability the same word unquoted could not, and none that skips a manifest check: `"secret.txt"`
//! is planned against exactly what `secret.txt` is planned against. Quoting is a fact about the
//! **line**, and authority here is a fact about what the shell **holds**.
//!
//! # `'` and `"` are the same today, and saying which will differ is not this milestone's call
//!
//! Both forms are literal. The difference POSIX draws between them is `$` expansion, and this shell
//! has no variables (milestone 47 owns them), so inventing the distinction now would be inventing
//! it rather than discovering it, which is the argument milestone 50 made about `InputSpec` and got
//! right by waiting.
//!
//! What they do differ in today is which byte they let you write: `echo "it's"` and
//! `echo 'say "hi"'` both work, and neither would with one form.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```
//! use grant_plan::word::read;
//!
//! // The gap this closes: a name with a space in it.
//! assert_eq!(read(b"\"my notes.txt\"").unwrap().text, b"my notes.txt");
//! // Quoted, so nothing will expand it.
//! assert!(read(b"'*.txt'").unwrap().quoted);
//! // Bare, so it is a pattern and designates a set.
//! assert!(!read(b"*.txt").unwrap().quoted);
//! // The other quote is an ordinary byte inside a quoted word.
//! assert_eq!(read(b"\"it's\"").unwrap().text, b"it's");
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **No backslash escape, and none is planned while tokens are slices.** `my\ notes.txt` is a
//!   file whose name contains a backslash, and `nav::component_fits` refuses that byte, so the line
//!   is refused rather than misread. The quoted spelling is the one that works.
//! - **Adjacent pieces are not joined.** `a"b"` is refused where POSIX would read `ab`. The refusal
//!   names the reason ([`Refusal::PartlyQuoted`]); it is not a silent misreading.
//! - **A quote character cannot appear inside a word quoted with itself.** `'it''s'` is
//!   [`Refusal::PartlyQuoted`] where POSIX joins three pieces into `it's`. Write it `"it's"`.
//! - **`"$?"` prints `$?`**, because both forms are literal today. When variables arrive the two
//!   forms have to stop being the same thing, and that decision belongs with them.
