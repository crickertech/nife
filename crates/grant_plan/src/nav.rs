//! **Navigation in a system with no global namespace** (milestone 47's commands).
//!
//! `cd`, `pwd` and `ls` are *builtins*, in the same category as `caps`: they spawn nothing, need no
//! grant, and confer no new authority, because the shell is reading and rebinding a capability it
//! already holds. That is not a technicality, it retires a real worry: a listing **program** would
//! have to be handed the power to read everything it lists. This module is the pure half of those
//! builtins, host-tested in milliseconds; the requests they make live in `user/src/swish.rs`.
//!
//! # A working directory was never the problem
//!
//! In capability terms a working directory is *a directory capability the shell holds, used as the
//! default base for resolving names*. Held by the shell that is entirely legitimate, the same as its
//! untyped budget. What is bad on Unix is three specific things, and this module answers each:
//!
//! 1. **Children inherit it silently.** Here they do not: a name on the command line is resolved
//!    against the shell's position **at the moment the grant is made** ([`crate::FileGrant`]), and
//!    the child receives a capability to that one file. The child has no cwd and cannot re-resolve
//!    anything, which is why the convenience is the shell's and the authority is explicit.
//! 2. **Relative paths resolve implicitly**, so a program's reach depends on invisible state. Here
//!    the resolution happens once, at the prompt, in a value you can print.
//! 3. **`..` walks out**, so the cwd bounds nothing. Here it cannot: see below.
//!
//! # The three earned divergences
//!
//! Divergence from Unix is a tax on every user forever, so it has to be forced by the model rather
//! than chosen. Three are:
//!
//! - **`/` is the root of *your* namespace** ([`Path::from_root`]), which is Plan 9's answer and
//!   not DOS's. There is no global namespace to root a path in, so an absolute path names the one
//!   root you have: the directory capability you were granted. Two shells both type `/report.txt`
//!   and open different files, or one of them opens nothing, because the syntax is rooted in what
//!   each holds. It confers nothing: `/a/b` reaches exactly what `cd a; cd b` reaches, so this is
//!   syntax for a walk you could already take. Until 2026-08-18 the syntax was refused outright
//!   (`Refused::Absolute`), which was the honest statement of a namespace that did not exist yet
//!   rather than a position; `pwd` has printed `/a/b` since the day it was written, and a shell
//!   that prints a path you cannot type back is the tell that the refusal had outlived itself.
//! - **`..` stops at your root** ([`Cwd::ascend`] returns `false`, and nothing is sent). You descend
//!   from what you hold and never ascend past it. Chroot's shape, reached from the other direction,
//!   and here it is not a check that could be wrong: the shell holds a *stack* of directory
//!   capabilities it descended through, `..` pops one, and at the root there is nothing to pop. The
//!   FS server would refuse the name anyway (`..` is not a component it accepts), so the two
//!   mechanisms agree without either relying on the other.
//! - **`pwd` is relative to your root** ([`Cwd::render`]), because naming anything above it implies
//!   a namespace that does not exist.
//!
//! What that buys, and Unix cannot: **every shell has its own root**. Two shells hold different
//! subtrees and neither can name the other's files, not by policy but because no capability reaching
//! them exists.

/// The deepest a shell tracks below its own root.
///
/// A bound rather than a policy: the shell keeps one directory capability per level so `..` can pop
/// one, and it has no allocator, so the stack is an array. Eight is far past any tree a demonstrator
