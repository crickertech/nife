//! **`grant_plan`: the grant-expression logic of the capability shell** (milestone 31, phase 1).
//!
//! This crate is the pure logic behind the shell's one idea: on a nife command line,
//! *designation is authorization* (Mark Miller's principle). Naming a resource in a command is
//! how you grant it; a program that names nothing gets nothing beyond the report channel every
//! spawn carries. There is no ambient authority to fall back on, so the failure when a program
//! needs something the command did not grant is legible ("you hold no such capability"), not a
//! Unix-flavored EPERM.
//!
//! It performs no IO and makes no syscalls. It turns a line of bytes into a decision: a
//! [`Command`], and for a program invocation an [`Endowment`] (exactly what to grant the child) or a
//! typed [`Refusal`] the shell prints at the prompt. That split is DECISIONS §7 applied, the same
//! shape as `line_editor`: the parsing and the manifest checking are host-tested in milliseconds, and
//! only the wiring (the shell and init that carry the caps) needs QEMU. See
//! notes/grant-expression.md and notes/program-manifest.md.
//!
//! # The grammar, after milestone 47 took two words out of it
//!
//! ```text
//! <prog> [-abc] [--mem N] [token ...]
//! caps [command]
//! time <command>
//! help
//! echo <text>
//! ```
//!
//! `caps` and `time` are **prefix words**: their operand is a whole command line, operators
//! included, which is why neither is a program (a program takes tokens) and why both keep the tail
//! unsplit for the shell to act on.
//!
//! Short options arrived with `rm` (milestone 47's rmdir lane), and they are checked against the
//! program's [`Manifest`] at the prompt rather than passed along unread, because one of them can
//! **widen a grant**: `rm -r logs` hands over the subtree that `rm logs` does not.
//!
//! There is no `run` verb and no `file:` designator, and both removals are milestone 47's
//! (roadmap, "`file:` and `run` are not earned"). A bare program name spawns it, because a shell
//! where builtins are bare words and programs need a prefix makes the user learn which class a
//! command is in before they can type it. A bare token in a file position designates the file,
//! because `file:` marked the half of the grant that was already visible (*which* file) and said
//! nothing about the half that matters (read or write), which lives in the [`Manifest`] by design.
//!
//! # The three moving parts
//!
//! - [`parse`] tokenizes a command line into a [`Command`]. A first word that is not a builtin is a
//!   program invocation, and everything after it is the `--mem N` budget grant plus **unclassified
//!   positional tokens**: the parser deliberately does not decide which token is the argument and
//!   which is the file, because that is the manifest's job.
//! - A [`Manifest`] is a program's declared endowment: does it take an argument, does it require
//!   (or forbid) a memory grant, may it be granted a file and in which direction, does it report
//!   back. [`Prog::manifest`] is the static table.
//! - [`plan`] checks a parsed invocation against the named program's manifest, **placing the
//!   positional tokens into the slots the manifest declares**, and yields an [`Endowment`] or a
//!   [`Refusal`]. A mismatch is caught here, at the prompt, before anything is spawned, which is
//!   milestone 23's component contract in embryo.
//!
//! # The wire half
//!
//! [`spawnproto`] is the word layout for the shell-to-init spawn protocol, the capability-shell
//! analogue of `line_editor::proto`. It is a userspace protocol (DECISIONS §21's shape): the kernel
//! routes the words and never reads them.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 63), replacing `capsh`. Refused `capsh` (Linux's
//! libcap ships `capsh(1)`, a capability shell wrapper, so a reader arriving from Linux would
//! assume ours is that tool); `designation`, `designate` and `designator` together (the user
//! designates by typing a name, and this crate's work starts after that, so all three put it in a
//! role it does not hold); and the grant synonyms `endow`, `award`, `confer`, `bestow`, `allot` and
//! `furnish` (grant is already this tree's word and a synonym is a decoder ring, and `endow` is
//! additionally taken by `supervision_proto::ChildEndowment`). Deliberately not named for `swish`: seven
//! things use it, so naming it for one consumer would repeat `dwarden`'s defect.

#![no_std]
// milestone 68's ratchet is workspace-wide (§107); this crate opts out until its 22-item
// worklist (notes/doc-coverage.md) is burned down.

/// is false there is a separate process on the far end of the head's input and none of this applies.
///
/// # The constraint, which is the kernel's and not the shell's
///
/// A process has **one wait point**. `SEND` blocks until a receiver takes the message, `RECV` blocks
/// until one arrives, and there is no select, no poll and no timed wait (design/roadmap/106 is
/// NOT-STARTED and is a kernel-surface fork). So a shell that is feeding a chain cannot also be
/// receiving from it, and the two blocked processes have nothing that could wake either.
///
/// **No interleaving schedule fixes this**, which is worth stating because it is the first thing
/// anybody reaches for. Alternating one send with one receive deadlocks whenever the stage reads
/// twice before it writes; alternating the other way deadlocks whenever it writes twice before it
/// reads. The shell cannot know which, because the whole point of the sink contract is that neither
/// end knows anything about the other.
///
/// # What makes a line runnable anyway: one barrier
///
/// A stage that declares [`InputSpec::Required::writes_while_reading`] `false` absorbs the whole
/// stream before it answers. One of those anywhere in the chain is enough: everything upstream of it
/// can stream freely, the shell's feed completes, and only then does anything travel back. So
/// `doc page.md | wc` runs and `doc page.md` is refused, with `| wc` being the fix the message names.
///
