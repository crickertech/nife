//! **The spawn protocol: the wire half of the shell-to-progenitor grant expression.**
//!
//! When the shell resolves a `run` into an [`Endowment`](crate::Endowment), it does not build the
//! child itself: the progenitor holds the initrd and is the ELF loader (the parser stays in one place, out of
//! the shell). So the shell tells the progenitor what to spawn and, crucially, *delegates the capabilities it
//! grants* over the same endpoint. This module is that contract's word layout, the capability-shell
//! analogue of `line_editor::proto`.
//!
//! It is a **userspace** protocol, not kernel ABI. The kernel routes these words the way it routes
//! any IPC (DECISIONS §10, §12, §21); it never reads them. Adding a field is a change here, not to
//! the syscall surface.
//!
//! # The exchange
//!
//! The shell owns the sequence; the progenitor serves it in a loop.
//!
//! 1. **Request.** The shell `SEND`s three words on the spawn endpoint: the program id, the
//!    integer argument, and the memory-grant page count. See [`request`] / [`prog_id`] /
//!    [`arg`] / [`mem_pages`].
//! 2. **The directory grant, if the request announced one** ([`Wiring::dir`], milestone 31 phase 3):
//!    [`GRANT_WORDS`] plain `SEND`s carrying the caretaker's `START` words and then the child's.
//!    Before the delegation rather than after, because these are **data and not capabilities** and
//!    mixing the two orders would put a `RECV` where a `RECV_CAP` belongs.
//! 3. **Delegation.** The capabilities the request announced, in a fixed order: the supervised
//!    job's pair (untyped, frame), then the **sink** (milestone 50), then the **source**, then the
//!    **diagnostic endpoint** (DECISIONS §67), then the **screen-narrowed tail's completion
//!    endpoint** (DECISIONS §106), then the `--mem` untyped. Order rather than tags, because both
//!    sides read the same [`Wiring`] out of the same word and a promise nobody receives would
//!    deadlock both.
//!
//!    If `mem_pages > 0`, the shell `SEND_CAP`s exactly one capability there: an
//!    untyped it split from *its own* budget, sized to `mem_pages`. This is the grant made real,
//!    not parsed and dropped. Programs that grant no capability (`least_authority_demo`) skip this step, and the progenitor
//!    knows to skip the matching `RECV_CAP` from `mem_pages == 0`.
//! 4. **Outcome.** The progenitor builds the child, endows it (the shared result endpoint always; the
//!    delegated untyped when present), and starts it. The child reports its own answer on the
//!    result endpoint. If the progenitor cannot build it (its own budget is spent, or the program vanished),
//!    it sends [`SPAWN_FAILED`] on the result endpoint so the shell's read completes instead of
//!    hanging.
//!
//! The result endpoint carries both the progenitor's failure sentinel and the child's success answer, and
//! the shell reads exactly once: a well-formed spawn yields the child's word, a failed one yields
//! [`SPAWN_FAILED`]. One reader, one word, no ambiguity.
//!
//! 5. **Death** (milestone 235). A child the kernel killed sends nothing, so neither of those two
//!    words arrives and the shell's single read has nothing to complete it. `job_undertaker`, which
//!    already holds the progenitor's supervision endpoint and already collects the corpse, sends
//!    [`JOB_FAULTED`] there instead. It is a third value on the same one-word read rather than a
//!    second channel, because the shell has one thread and can be blocked in exactly one `RECV`;
//!    see [`JOB_FAULTED`] for the two couplings this refused.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! The image request ([`Wiring::image`], DECISIONS §219 (how the shell names an installed program to the spawner) option D) is a first cut, and these are
//! what it does not do yet. Milestone 198 (a package manager)'s block carries the same list.
//!
//! - **A caller that claims the run-unvouched capability without holding it hangs the progenitor.**
//!   [`Wiring::run_unvouched`] promises one `SEND` on [`RUN_UNVOUCHED_SLOT`], and the progenitor
//!   waits for it on the endpoint behind that slot, which only a holder can reach. A shell that
//!   sets the bit and holds nothing leaves the progenitor blocked there for the life of the boot.
//!   It is the exposure every promised message in this protocol already has (the frame entry
//!   below), and it is reachable only by a program that holds the spawn endpoint and lies on it,
//!   which today is the boot shell alone.
//! - **A holder can lend its presentation.** The progenitor serves requests one at a time, so a
//!   holder's `SEND` is taken only while some request that claimed the capability is being served.
//!   A holder that sends one early, on purpose, can let another caller's claim through. That is a
//!   proxy, and no capability system prevents a holder from running something on another's behalf;
//!   it is recorded so nobody reads the missing `GRANT` as a stronger promise than it is.
//! - **An installed program's manifest is `uptime`'s** ([`crate::INSTALLED_MANIFEST_OF`]), because
//!   no manifest travels with a package yet (§197 (a package is one archive file)'s open question). A program that needs a clock,
//!   the network or a directory is not refused by name; it runs and finds the slot empty.
//! - **Only a plain line runs an image.** A path in a pipeline or behind a redirection reaches
//!   the planner as a program name and is refused as "no such program", which is true of the name
//!   and says nothing about the bytes. Nothing sets the bit alongside `interruptible` or `dir`, and
//!   the progenitor refuses an interruptible image request if one arrives.
//! - **A shell that cannot retype a frame mid-request hangs the prompt.** The staging region is
//!   sized to the image, so this needs a full capability table in the shell, but if it happens the
//!   progenitor waits for a frame that never comes. Nothing in the ABI lets either side abandon a
//!   half-sent request; every capability this protocol promises has the same exposure.

/// The interruptible bit, packed into the high half of the page-count word so one `SEND` still
/// carries the whole request. `mem_pages` is a small count (`memory_grant_depleter`'s ceiling is

/// tell a slow job from a dead one, which is the thing the hang already could not tell.

/// **The endpoint carrying the death** loses on the ordinary path. Pointing a job's fault target at
/// the endpoint the shell reads would work for a fault, and §26.3 flows *exits* down the same
/// endpoint too, so every ordinary job would leave a second message on the shell's result endpoint
/// behind its answer and the next command's read would take it. It also moves collection into the
