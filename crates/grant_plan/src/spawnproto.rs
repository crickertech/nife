//! **The spawn protocol: the wire half of the shell-to-init grant expression.**
//!
//! When the shell resolves a `run` into an [`Endowment`](crate::Endowment), it does not build the
//! child itself: init holds the initrd and is the ELF loader (the parser stays in one place, out of
//! the shell). So the shell tells init what to spawn and, crucially, *delegates the capabilities it
//! grants* over the same endpoint. This module is that contract's word layout, the capability-shell
//! analogue of `line_editor::proto`.
//!
//! It is a **userspace** protocol, not kernel ABI. The kernel routes these words the way it routes
//! any IPC (DECISIONS §10, §12, §21); it never reads them. Adding a field is a change here, not to
//! the syscall surface.
//!
//! # The exchange
//!
//! The shell owns the sequence; init serves it in a loop.
//!
//! 1. **Request.** The shell `SEND`s three words on the spawn endpoint: the program id, the
//!    integer argument, and the memory-grant page count. See [`request`] / [`prog_id`] /
//!    [`arg`] / [`mem_pages`].
//! 2. **The directory grant, if the request announced one** ([`Wiring::dir`], milestone 31 phase 3):
//!    [`GRANT_WORDS`] plain `SEND`s carrying the caretaker's `START` words and then the child's.
//!    Before the delegation rather than after, because these are **data and not capabilities** and
//!    mixing the two orders would put a `RECV` where a `RECV_CAP` belongs.
//! 3. **Delegation.** The capabilities the request announced, in a fixed order: the supervised
//!    job's pair (untyped, frame), then the **sink** (milestone 50), then the **source**, then the
//!    **diagnostic endpoint** (DECISIONS §67), then the **screen-narrowed tail's completion
//!    endpoint** (DECISIONS §106), then the `--mem` untyped. Order rather than tags, because both
//!    sides read the same [`Wiring`] out of the same word and a promise nobody receives would
//!    deadlock both.
//!
//!    If `mem_pages > 0`, the shell `SEND_CAP`s exactly one capability there: an
//!    untyped it split from *its own* budget, sized to `mem_pages`. This is the grant made real,
//!    not parsed and dropped. Programs that grant no capability (worker) skip this step, and init
//!    knows to skip the matching `RECV_CAP` from `mem_pages == 0`.
//! 4. **Outcome.** init builds the child, endows it (the shared result endpoint always; the
//!    delegated untyped when present), and starts it. The child reports its own answer on the
//!    result endpoint. If init cannot build it (its own budget is spent, or the program vanished),
//!    it sends [`SPAWN_FAILED`] on the result endpoint so the shell's read completes instead of
//!    hanging.
//!
//! The result endpoint carries both init's failure sentinel and the child's success answer, and
//! the shell reads exactly once: a well-formed spawn yields the child's word, a failed one yields
//! [`SPAWN_FAILED`]. One reader, one word, no ambiguity.

/// The interruptible bit, packed into the high half of the page-count word so one `SEND` still

/// shell cannot be both this stage's feeder and its reader, so its primary output defaults to
/// `terminal_sink_caretaker` instead of the shell's own result endpoint, the same adapter a
/// declared second stream already reaches by default under DECISIONS §67.
///
/// What follows is not a sink capability (init already knows to build that default from its own
/// `term_sink`, unprompted, the same way it builds a diagnostic default). It is a **fresh
/// endpoint the shell minted and kept a copy of**, delegated so init can install it as this child's
/// DECISIONS §26 fault target in place of its own domain channel. The kernel then delivers the
/// child's exit there instead of to init's reaper, and the shell `RECV`s it as its completion
/// signal instead of draining the child's bytes, which it no longer sees.
const SCREEN_BIT: u64 = 1 << 37;

/// **A directory grant follows, and init is to build a caretaker for it** (milestone 31 phase 3).
///
/// The odd one out on this word, because it announces **data rather than a capability**. Every other

/// reason is that the shell has nothing to delegate. A directory grant is delivered by a
/// `fs_subtree_caretaker`, the caretaker has to hold the file service to attenuate it, and **the
/// shell's file-service endpoint carries no `GRANT`**, so the shell could not hand one over if it
/// wanted to. What it can do is say what the grant *is*; init holds the endpoint and builds the rest.

/// 2. **the confined program's `START` words**, which init passes to the program verbatim: for `rm`,
///    the operand's name and the options that were typed.
///
/// **This module does not decode either, deliberately.** They are `fs_proto::grant`'s packing, and
/// `grant_plan` has no non-dev dependency on `fs_proto` on purpose (its own manifest says why: the
/// shell must be able to check a command line without linking the filesystem contract). Passing them
/// through as opaque triples keeps that true, and it means a change to how a grant is packed is a
/// change in one crate rather than in the wire this one owns. The shell packs them; init forwards
/// them; nothing in between reads them.
