//! **The operators: `>`, `<` and `|`** (milestone 50, notes/pipes.md).
//!
//! This module is the *shape* of a command line, one level above [`crate::parse`]. It takes the
//! whole line and splits it into a [`Line`]: a sequence of stages, plus the file names on either
//! end. Each stage is then parsed exactly as a whole line was before this existed, which is why
//! adding three operators changed nothing about how a command is read.
//!
//! # There is one mechanism here, not three
//!
//! `>` and `|` do the same thing: they put a different capability in a program's **output slot**.
//! The program cannot tell which, and that indifference is the milestone's claim
//! (notes/sink-protocol.md). `<` is the same substitution on the **input slot**, which is the sink
//! contract read from the other end: an endpoint the program holds with `READ`, on which sink
//! messages arrive until [`byte_sink_proto::OP_EOF`](../../byte_sink_proto/constant.OP_EOF.html).
//!
//! So this module produces [`Sink`] and [`Source`] values and nothing else. Whether the thing on
//! the other end is a file, another program, or the shell itself is a wiring question, and no part
//! of it reaches the program.
//!
//! # The grammar
//!
//! ```text
//! line  := stage ('|' stage)*
//! stage := <command words> ('<' name | '>' name | '>>' name | '2>' name | '2>>' name)*
//! ```
//!
//! Three rules, each of which exists to keep a line from meaning something other than it looks
//! like:
//!
//! - **A redirection goes last in its stage.** `wc < report.txt` is the spelling; `< report.txt wc`
//!   is [`Refusal::WordAfterRedirect`]. Bash accepts the second and nobody writes it, and refusing
//!   it is what lets a stage's command text be a slice of the line rather than something
//!   reassembled (this shell has no allocator).
//! - **Only the first stage takes input and only the last is redirected.** `a > f | b` names a
//!   destination for `a` and then pipes `a` somewhere else, which is two answers to one question;
//!   it is [`Refusal::RedirectMidPipeline`] rather than a silent precedence rule.
//! - **A redirection names one file.** A pattern there is [`Refusal::PatternInRedirect`]: a
//!   redirection designates a single destination, and a set does not designate one.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```
//! # use grant_plan::line::{split, Line, Mode};
//! let l = split(b"date | wc").unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(l.stages(), [&b"date"[..], b"wc"]);
//! assert!(l.input.is_none() && l.output.is_none());
//!
//! let l = split(b"date > report.txt").unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(l.stages(), [&b"date"[..]]);
//! assert_eq!(l.output, Some(&b"report.txt"[..]));
//! assert_eq!(l.mode(), Mode::Truncate);
//!
//! // `>>` names the same destination and only changes what happens to what is already in it.
//! assert_eq!(split(b"date >> report.txt").unwrap().mode(), Mode::Append);
//!
//! // Whitespace around an operator is optional, as it is in every shell.
//! assert_eq!(split(b"date>report.txt").unwrap().output, Some(&b"report.txt"[..]));
//! ```
//!
//! # `2>` is the same substitution again, and the `2` is not a file descriptor
//!
//! `2>` (DECISIONS §67) names where a program's **declared second output** goes. It looks like
//! Unix's spelling and it is not Unix's mechanism: nothing here agrees in advance that "2" is
//! anything, so the operator binds to a stream the program's manifest declares
//! ([`OutputSpec`](crate::OutputSpec)) and is [`Refusal::NoDiagnosticStream`] aimed at a program
//! that declares none. The digit is kept because it is the spelling a person already knows, not
//! because a number means anything.
//!
//! The digit must be at a word boundary, exactly as it must in a Unix shell: `date 2> err` is the
//! operator and `worker 2 > out` is the integer `2` and a `>`. A `2` inside a word (`wc2>f`) is part
//! of the word.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A line has one diagnostic stream, not one per stage.** `2>` goes at the tail like `>`, and
//!   what it names is where *the line's* diagnostics go, because the shell mints one endpoint for
//!   the line and hands it to every stage that declares one. So every stage of a pipeline carrying
//!   a `2>` must declare a diagnostic stream, and a pipeline where only the producer does is
//!   refused rather than half-wired.
//! - **No `<<`.** A here-document is refused as [`Refusal::NoRedirectTarget`], because the second
//!   `<` is read as the operator it is and then there is no name after it. The message is about a
//!   missing name where the mistake was a missing feature, which is a wording gap and not a
//!   silent acceptance.
//! - **Quoting reaches this module, and it decides what an operator is** (milestone 67). A `>`,
//!   `<`, `|` or `2>` inside quotes is an ordinary byte, so `echo "a > b"` has no redirection on it
//!   and `date > "my out.txt"` writes to a file whose name has a space in it. What quoting cannot do
//!   is put an operator *back*: there is no spelling that makes a quoted `>` redirect.
//! - **A quoted redirection name is exempt from [`Refusal::PatternInRedirect`]**, because quoting is
//!   what says the token designates one thing. `> "*.txt"` writes to a file called `*.txt`; `> *.txt`
//!   is still refused.
