//! **Expansion: what a pattern on the command line designates** (milestone 47's globbing lane).
//!
//! `crates/glob` answers "does this pattern match this name", and nothing else: it is a total
//! function on two byte strings with no filesystem in it. This module is the layer that turns that
//! into an **authority**, because on this system a glob is not a convenience for typing fewer
//! characters.
//!
//! # The property the whole lane exists for
//!
//! **The expansion you see is the grant.** `echo *.txt` prints literally the authority that `rm
//! *.txt` would transfer, because the matched set *is* the namespace the caretaker will serve. Unix
//! cannot make that claim: `rm`'s authority never came from the command line at all, and the glob
//! only told it which of its existing powers to use.
//!
//! That claim is only worth anything if the two go through **one** expander, which is what
//! [`Expander`] is for: `echo` drives it and so does the grant planner ([`crate::plan`]), over the
//! same directory listing, and neither can be talked into a different answer. The shell's guest test
//! runs both and compares.
//!
//! # Why the names are owned
//!
//! A name a pattern produced is **not a slice of the command line**. It comes out of a directory
//! listing the shell reads in rounds into one reused buffer, so a borrow would dangle at the second
//! round. [`Name`] and [`NameSet`] therefore own their bytes, and the consequence is worth naming
//! because it is the same rule the rest of a grant already follows: an [`crate::Endowment`] carries
//! values, not pointers back at the shell, so nothing that happens after a grant is planned can
//! change what it means.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! No `**`, no qualifiers, no expansion of anything but the **last component** of a token. All
//! three are notes/glob.md's boundaries and none of them is a scheduling excuse: `**` is a
//! *traversal* feature (descending means holding a capability for the directory below), and a
//! qualifier like `*(.)` needs type, mtime and size per candidate, which turns one enumeration into
//! N `FSTAT`s and needs a read right beyond enumerate. Both are authority questions wearing matching
//! costumes, so they do not get answered inside a matcher.
