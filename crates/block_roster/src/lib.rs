//! **What drives are attached** (milestone 57): the roster page, and the authority it is not.
//!
//! `lsblk` on Linux reads `/sys/block`, which every process on the machine can read, and the
//! listing is therefore ambient: knowing what disks exist is free, and so is naming one to a tool
//! that will write to it. Here it is a capability. The kernel writes this page once at wiring time
//! and maps it **read-only** into exactly the programs that were granted it; a program without the
//! mapping has nowhere to look, and the refusal is "you hold no such capability" rather than a
//! permission check.
//!
//! # The line this draws, which is the point of the milestone
//!
//! Listing the drives and holding one of them are **different authorities**:
//!
//! - the roster says a device exists, what bus it came off, and its ordinal;
//! - a block-service endpoint says you may read and write one particular device's blocks.
//!
//! So the roster deliberately carries **no capacity**, and that is a design decision rather than an
//! omission. A disk's size is a fact about its contents-bearing surface, and you learn it by asking
//! the device (`filesystem_proto::blk::SIZE`), which takes the endpoint. An enumerator that answered "how
//! big" would be answering a question only a holder should be able to ask, and it would also have
//! to bring a PCI function up to find out, which has side effects the kernel has no business
//! causing on behalf of a listing.
//!
//! Compare the compositor's window enumeration (DECISIONS §33), which is the same shape and the
//! precedent this follows: a **read-only mapping, not a verb**. There is no request to forge, no
//! server to confuse, and nothing to authorize at read time, because the authorization happened
//! when the mapping was made.
//!
//! # This is not a `*_proto`, and the difference is the whole design
//!
//! Ten crates in `crates/` end in `_proto` and describe **messages two programs exchange**:
//! `filesystem_proto`, `byte_sink_proto`, `clock_proto` and the rest. This one is not among them, and a reader
//! scanning the directory should not expect a protocol here. It describes **bytes at an address**,
//! written once by the kernel at wiring time and thereafter only read.
//!
//! That is not a naming detail, it is the authority claim restated: a protocol has a server, and a
//! server is something that can be asked, confused, or persuaded. There is nothing here to ask. The
//! decision about who may see the machine's disks was made when the mapping was created, and a
//! program either holds the page or has nowhere to look.
//!
//! It also has a consequence the `_proto` crates carry and this one does not: **no seqlock.** The
//! clock page needs one because the clock service republishes it (`clock_proto::ClockPage`); this
//! page never changes after the mapping exists, so a reader needs no protocol for reading it
//! consistently. Hot plug would change that, and it would be a change to this crate rather than to
//! its readers.
//!
//! # The page
//!
//! ```text
//!   0..8     MAGIC
//!   8..12    count: how many entries follow
//!   12..16   capacity: how many entries this page has room for
//!   16..     entries, ENTRY_BYTES each
//!
//!   an entry:
//!   0..4     ordinal: which device of this transport, 0-based
//!   4..8     transport: TRANSPORT_MMIO or TRANSPORT_PCI
//! ```
//!
//! Little-endian, fixed width, no pointers: the reader is a `no_std` program with no allocator and
//! the writer is the kernel, and a self-describing format between two programs in one tree would be
//! ceremony. A zeroed frame reads as an empty roster with the wrong magic, which [`Roster::read`]
//! refuses, so a page nobody wrote is never mistaken for a machine with no disks.
//!
//! ```
//! # use block_roster::{Device, Roster, TRANSPORT_MMIO, TRANSPORT_PCI};
//! let mut page = [0u8; 4096];
//! let devices = [
//!     Device { ordinal: 0, transport: TRANSPORT_MMIO },
//!     Device { ordinal: 0, transport: TRANSPORT_PCI },
//! ];
//! block_roster::write(&mut page, &devices).unwrap();
//!
//! let roster = Roster::read(&page).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(roster.len(), 2);
//! assert_eq!(roster.get(1).unwrap().transport, TRANSPORT_PCI);
//! ```
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-03 (calef, milestone 57). The lane shipped it provisionally and calef
//! approved it by name. It deliberately does not take the `*_proto` suffix its ten neighbours
//! carry: a protocol has a server, and a server is something that can be asked, confused or
//! persuaded, where this is a read-only page whose authorization happened when the mapping was
//! made.
