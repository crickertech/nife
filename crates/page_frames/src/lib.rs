//! A physical frame allocator.
//!
//! Hands out 4 KiB pages of physical memory. This is the bottom of the memory
//! hierarchy: everything above it (page tables at milestone 4, the kernel heap, DMA
//! buffers at milestone 8, user process pages at milestone 7) ultimately asks this for
//! its memory, and there is nothing underneath it to ask.
//!
//! # Why a bitmap, and not a free list
//!
//! The classic hobby-OS answer is a free list: link each free page to the next by
//! writing a pointer *into the free page itself*. Zero metadata overhead, O(1)
//! allocation, and genuinely elegant (it is what xv6 does).
//!
//! We use a bitmap instead, for two reasons:
//!
//! 1. **Contiguity.** A free list cannot answer "give me 8 physically contiguous
//!    frames." Milestone 8's virtio DMA buffers need exactly that, and retrofitting it
//!    means throwing the free list away.
//!
//! 2. **Testability.** A free list stores its metadata inside the memory it manages, so
//!    testing it requires handing it real memory and doing unsafe pointer writes. A
//!    bitmap's logic is *pure*: given a bitmap and a request, which frame? We can test
//!    it exhaustively on the host with no memory at all, which is DECISIONS.md §7.
//!
//! The cost is 1 bit per frame: 32 KiB of bitmap per GiB of RAM. Cheap.
//!
//! # Why this is a separate crate
//!
//! Pure logic. Bytes in, frame numbers out. No hardware, no `unsafe`. Its tests run on
//! the host in milliseconds instead of booting an emulator.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The wiring an early boot does: name the span, hand it a bitmap, then declare what is real RAM
//! and what inside it is already spoken for.
//!
//! ```
//! use page_frames::{FrameAllocator, Frame, FRAME_SIZE};
//!
//! const BASE: u64 = 0x4000_0000;
//! const TOTAL: usize = 64;                      // 64 frames of address space
//! let mut bitmap = [0u8; FrameAllocator::bitmap_bytes(TOTAL)];
//! let mut fa = FrameAllocator::new(BASE, TOTAL, &mut bitmap);
//!
//! // Nothing is free until someone says so: an allocator starts owning nothing.
//! assert_eq!(fa.stats().free(), 0);
//!
//! fa.mark_free(BASE, TOTAL as u64 * FRAME_SIZE);        // all of it is real RAM
//! fa.mark_used(BASE, 4 * FRAME_SIZE);                   // ... but the first four hold the kernel
//! assert_eq!(fa.stats().free(), TOTAL - 4);
//!
//! let f = fa.alloc().expect("60 frames are free");
//! assert!(f.addr() >= BASE + 4 * FRAME_SIZE, "never hands back the kernel's own frames");
//! assert_eq!(fa.stats().free(), TOTAL - 5);
//!
//! fa.free(f);
//! assert_eq!(fa.stats().free(), TOTAL - 4);
//! ```
//!
//! A frame is an address that is known to be aligned, which is the point of the newtype:
//!
//! ```
//! use page_frames::{Frame, FRAME_SIZE};
//!
//! // `containing` rounds down to the frame an arbitrary address falls in.
//! assert_eq!(Frame::containing(0x4000_0FFF).addr(), 0x4000_0000);
//! assert_eq!(Frame::containing(0x4000_1000).addr(), 0x4000_1000);
//! ```
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review). Renamed from
//! `frames`: the same collision DECISIONS §113 already found and fixed for the kernel's `Frame`
//! capability type (renamed to `PageFrame`) against `crates/compositor`'s own use of "frame" for a
//! rendered screen update. This crate is the physical-page allocator that backs those page frames.
