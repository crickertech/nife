#![no_std]
//! **Live component replacement: the shared half** (milestone 23, DECISIONS §41).
//!
//! Four programs make up the hot-swap system (`swapper` the operator, `rust_swappable` and
//! `c_swappable` the two instances of the swappable component, `chatty` the client and the
//! attacker), and this is what they share: the wire protocol, the addresses of the pages they pass
//! between them, the digest both language implementations of the component must compute, and the
//! serving loop itself. Compiled into each binary with `#[path = "swap.rs"] mod swap;`, the same
//! way the supervision tree shares `suptree.rs`.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! ```text
//!                     ┌──── the stable name: one endpoint, forever ────┐
//!    chatty ──CALL──► │                  SVC                           │ ◄──RECV_CAP── rust_swappable v1
//!   (client)          └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ◄──RECV_CAP── c_swappable v2
//! ```
//!
//! There is no process in that data path. The client's capability never changes, the client's loop
//! never branches, and the swap is a change in *who is parked in `RECV_CAP`*. That is the whole
//! trick, and it is DECISIONS §12's endpoint-only naming cashed in: a client names an endpoint and
//! never a peer, so the peer is free to be somebody else tomorrow.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! **A caveat about this example first, because it is a limitation and not a footnote.** This crate
//! takes an unconditional `user_rt` dependency, so `script/test`'s host pass excludes it (see the
//! exclusion list in `xtask`, derived and checked by `script/lint`). The example below therefore runs
//! under `cargo test --doc -p swap_proto` on an aarch64 host and **is not checked by the gate**. It
//! is written as a real example rather than a fenced comment so that it is at least checkable; the
//! fix is to split the pure half out from the serving loop, which is a change no lane has made.
//!
//! What a client learns from one exchange, and it is two facts in two words: the answer, and *who
//! answered*. The second is the only way anything outside the operator can tell a swap happened.
//!
//! ```
//! use swap_proto::{digest, tag, tag_seq, tag_version};
//!
//! // v1 answers request 7.
//! let (r0, r1) = (digest(7), tag(1, 7));
//! assert_eq!(r0, digest(7)); // the client checks the arithmetic itself
//! assert_eq!(tag_version(r1), 1);
//! assert_eq!(tag_seq(r1), 7);
//!
//! // The operator swaps the component. The client's capability did not change, its loop did not
//! // branch, and the only observable difference is the version word.
//! let (r0_after, r1_after) = (digest(8), tag(2, 8));
//! assert_eq!(r0_after, digest(8)); // the same eight lines, in C this time, bit for bit
//! assert_eq!(tag_version(r1_after), 2);
//!
//! // Which is why the digest is deliberately trivial: two language implementations of one
//! // definition must agree, so the client can check its server without trusting either.
//! assert_ne!(digest(7), digest(8));
//! ```
//!
//! # The one thing the component owns that cannot be shared
//!
//! The UART's registers. Two processes writing one device's registers is the interleaving hazard
//! the roadmap's step 2 exists for, so the operator takes the registers back with
//! `Frame::REVOKE` on the device capability (DECISIONS §41) between quiescing the old instance and
//! endowing the new one. The old instance is asked to touch them one more time afterwards, and the
//! kernel's fault message is the receipt.
//!
//! Name: recorded (milestone 46, and notes/naming.md's crate section). The wire contract was
//! spelled four ways (`fs_proto`, `graphics_proto`, `netproto`, `line_editor::proto`) for one concept;
//! `*_proto` won on 2026-07-30 under DECISIONS §39, and `script/lint` has checked it since. That
//! rule plus the service the stem names produces this name, which is the whole of what `recorded`
//! claims: calef ruled on the rule, and never on this crate.
//! The stem is milestone 23's word for live replacement, which no record weighs against another.

//     declaration, which is the drop-in claim in its smallest true form.
//   - **A role name is the component's, and the object is the supervisor's.** `CLIENT` asks to use an
//     endpoint it calls `service`; on the direct channel that is the shared service endpoint and on
//     the queued channel it is the broker's front endpoint. One declaration, two routings, and the
