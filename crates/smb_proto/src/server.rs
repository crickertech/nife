//! **The per-connection SMB2 state machine**: one inbound message (possibly a compound chain) in,
//! one response message out, against a [`Share`].
//!
//! Pure logic over byte slices, no allocation, no IO, so the whole protocol runs under host tests
//! (see the bottom of this file for a full client session driven through it) and stays reachable
//! by the tree's verification method. The `smb_server` role feeds it bytes from the socket
//! contract and writes back what it returns; nothing else is between this machine and the wire.
//!
//! What it implements, and the shape of what it refuses, are the crate header's scope: SMB 2.1, a
//! share tree, compounds with related operations (macOS opens files as CREATE + `QUERY_INFO` + CLOSE
//! chains, so compounds are not optional). Everything refused is refused with a real NT status,
//! because a client's retry logic keys on them.
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! Sessions are guest **only when a caller asks for that**, by passing
//! [`crate::authenticator::NoIdentity`] to [`Connection::handle`]. A caller that passes a real
//! [`crate::authenticator::Authenticator`] gets a machine that refuses an unproven session with
//! [`STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`] and never sets `session_ready`, so every later command falls through the
//! state gate below. This module does no cryptography of any kind; see
//! [`crate::authenticator`] for why that is a property rather than a gap.
//!
//! # The write path, and where read-only is enforced
//!
//! The mutating commands are `CREATE` with a disposition that creates or truncates, `WRITE`, and
//! `SET_INFO`. Each one asks [`Share::writable`] **first**, and a share that answers `false` gets
//! [`STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`] without the backing being called at all. That ordering is deliberate
//! rather than incidental: refusing here is a statement a client can act on before it opens a
//! file, and it means a read-only share is read-only even if its backing would have said yes.
//! [`crate::share`]'s trait defaults are the independent second line.
