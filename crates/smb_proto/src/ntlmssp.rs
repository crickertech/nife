//! **NTLMSSP messages** ([MS-NLMP] §2.2): the three-message dance SMB2 session setup carries.
//!
//! This module is the *message framing* only, and that is now a security property rather than a
//! description of unfinished work. The arithmetic (`NTOWFv2`, proofs, session keys) lives in the
//! `ntlm` crate, **which this crate does not depend on**: `ntlm` is a
//! `[dev-dependencies]` entry, so the shipping `smb_proto` cannot compute a proof and the tests
//! can. That is the strongest available form of "the SMB server never holds the key" (AGENTS.md's
//! ladder, rung one): the code that would need one is not linked into the artifact, and Cargo is
//! the mechanism.
//!
//! What this module does is take an AUTHENTICATE message apart ([`parse`] into
//! [`Message::Authenticate`], carrying an [`Authenticate`]) and hand the pieces to the
//! [`crate::authenticator`] seam, which answers yes or no. Every byte it extracts is either public
//! (the account name, the domain, the client's blob) or a MAC (`NTProofStr`); none of it is a key,
//! and none of it is useful without the key that verifies it.
//!
//! The CHALLENGE this module builds is what lets a real client get that far: macOS will not
//! proceed to AUTHENTICATE without a well-formed CHALLENGE carrying target info.
