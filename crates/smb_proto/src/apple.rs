//! **Apple's SMB2 extensions: the `AAPL` create context** (milestone 55).
//!
//! macOS will mount a plain SMB2 share, and it will not offer one as a **Time Machine
//! destination**. What it looks for is this: an `AAPL`-tagged create context on the first CREATE
//! of a tree connect, answered by the server with a context of its own saying which Apple
//! extensions it implements. Samba implements the same exchange as `vfs_fruit`, and
//! `fruit:aapl = yes` is the first line of the working configuration
//! (design/roadmap/55-time-machine.md records the whole stanza, measured off calef's router).
//!
//! There is no public specification. [MS-SMB2] defines the *container* ([`crate::create_context`])
//! and says nothing about this tag, so what follows is the layout Samba's `vfs_fruit` implements
//! and that macOS has been talking to for a decade. **Where this file states a constant it is
//! because that is what the reference implementation puts on the wire**, not because a document
//! says so, and the honest consequence is recorded under BUGS: nothing here has met a Mac.
//!
//! # The exchange
//!
//! The client sends **24 bytes** and no other length is accepted (the reference checks the same
//! way, and treats any other length as a context to ignore):
//!
//! | offset | field | |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | command (u32) | [`CMD_SERVER_QUERY`]; [`CMD_RESOLVE_ID`] is the other one and is not answered |
//! | 4 | reserved (u32) | |
//! | 8 | request bitmap (u64) | which of the three answers below it wants |
//! | 16 | client capabilities (u64) | what the *client* implements |
//!
//! The server answers with a 16-byte prefix (the same command code, a zero reserved word, and the
//! **request bitmap echoed** as the reply bitmap) followed by exactly the answers the bitmap asked
//! for, in bit order:
//!
//! | bit | answer |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`BIT_SERVER_CAPS`] | server capabilities (u64) |
//! | [`BIT_VOLUME_CAPS`] | volume capabilities (u64) |
//! | [`BIT_MODEL_INFO`] | a zero word, the model string's byte length (u32), then the string in UTF-16LE |
//!
//! # What this server claims, and what it refuses to claim
//!
//! Every bit below is a claim a client will act on, so each one is set only where this tree can
//! back it. That is the whole of the decision and it is listed in the pull request as a wire
//! decision, because the bits are something two programs agree on.
//!
//! **Server capabilities: [`SERVER_UNIX_BASED`], and nothing else.** The reference sets it
//! unconditionally, and it is true here in the sense the bit means (there is no NT ACL model
//! behind this share). The three it does not set:
//!
//! - [`SERVER_READ_DIR_ATTR`] would promise Apple's extended directory enumeration, which returns
//!   Finder info and resource-fork sizes inside the listing. This server has no Finder info to
//!   return (see the metadata question in milestone 55's block), so claiming it would make macOS
//!   ask a question with no true answer.
//! - [`SERVER_OSX_COPYFILE`] would promise a server-side copy, which arrives as an `FSCTL` this
//!   server answers `STATUS_FS_DRIVER_REQUIRED`.
//! - [`SERVER_NFS_ACE`] would promise POSIX permissions carried as NFS ACEs. The reference has
//!   `fruit:nfs_aces = no`, so the working configuration does not set it either.
//!
//! **Volume capabilities: [`VOLUME_FULL_SYNC`], and nothing else.** That bit **is**
//! `fruit:time machine = yes`: it is the single flag on the SMB side that tells macOS this
//! server's durability is good enough to hold a backup, and without it the share is a share and
//! never a destination. **It is backed by a real device flush** (`filesystem_proto::fs::SYNC` under SMB2's
//! `FLUSH`, milestone 55); see BUGS for what it still does not promise. The two it does not set:
//!
//! - [`VOLUME_CASE_SENSITIVE`] would be a lie in the other direction. The backing filesystem is
//!   case-sensitive, but this server folds every name to lower case at the wire
//!   ([`crate::utf16le_to_ascii_lower`], and the crate BUGS on names), so what a client can
//!   observe is a share that is not case-sensitive.
//! - [`VOLUME_RESOLVE_ID`] would promise [`CMD_RESOLVE_ID`], resolving a file by its on-disk id
//!   without a path. Nothing here mints stable file ids.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! The whole of the server side, which is what [`crate::server`] calls when it finds the tag:
//!
//! ```
//! use smb_proto::apple;
//!
//! // What macOS sends: a server query asking for all three answers.
//! let mut request = [0u8; apple::REQUEST_LEN];
//! request[0] = apple::CMD_SERVER_QUERY as u8;
//! request[8] = (apple::BIT_SERVER_CAPS | apple::BIT_VOLUME_CAPS | apple::BIT_MODEL_INFO) as u8;
//!
//! let mut reply = [0u8; apple::MAX_RESPONSE];
//! let n = apple::server_query(&request, &mut reply).unwrap();
//! let reply = &reply[..n];
//!
//! // The reply bitmap echoes the request's, and the answers follow in bit order.
//! assert_eq!(smb_proto::r64(reply, 8), 0b111);
//! assert_eq!(smb_proto::r64(reply, 16), apple::SERVER_UNIX_BASED);
//! assert_eq!(smb_proto::r64(reply, 24) & apple::VOLUME_FULL_SYNC, apple::VOLUME_FULL_SYNC);
//!
//! // The model comes back as the UTF-16LE it is on the wire, so a reader that wants to compare
//! // it encodes what it expected rather than decoding what arrived.
//! let mut want = [0u8; 2 * 11];
//! let n = smb_proto::ascii_to_utf16le(apple::MODEL, &mut want);
//! assert_eq!(apple::model_utf16le(reply), Some(&want[..n]));
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Nothing here has met a Mac**, and it cannot under the emulator's discovery half; the TCP
//!   half can be and is (the QEMU gate sends this context and checks the answer), but a conforming
//!   client this tree wrote is not `smbfs`. The first real Time Machine attempt is where the rest
//!   of milestone 55 gets written.
//! - **[`VOLUME_FULL_SYNC`] is backed as of 2026-08-18, and here is what it still does not
//!   promise.** The entry that used to sit here said the claim outran the stack, and it did: every
//!   `filesystem_proto` write committed to the RedoxFS header ring before the reply, so there was never a
//!   write-back cache above the block device, but the block server issued no
//!   `VIRTIO_BLK_T_FLUSH`, so the durability of the last acknowledged write was the device's word
//!   rather than ours. Milestone 55's durability half added `filesystem_proto::blk::FLUSH` and
//!   `filesystem_proto::fs::SYNC`, and SMB2's `FLUSH` now drives both; a device that offers no
//!   `VIRTIO_BLK_F_FLUSH` produces an error at the client rather than a success.
//!
//!   What is left is narrower and worth naming where the claim is met. **The sync is device-wide**,
//!   so flushing one handle makes the whole image durable; nothing below can do less. **Nothing
//!   fences**: `filesystem_proto` has no ordering primitive, so this promises "everything acknowledged is
//!   durable now" and not "these writes landed in this order". And **a device that lies about its
//!   own flush is outside anything a protocol can check**, which is the same limit
//!   notes/fs-server.md's crash-injection table records from the other side.
//! - **The model string is compiled in.** [`MODEL`] is one constant, matching the reference's
//!   `fruit:model = TimeCapsule`. `mdns_config` made the same string a document a person edits and
//!   this has not; milestone 131 (a share is configured, not compiled) is where the two meet.
//!   Worth knowing that the reference runs with the two knobs **disagreeing**: its `_device-info`
//!   TXT advertises `model=MacSamba` while its Samba config says `TimeCapsule` (notes/mdns.md's
//!   capture), so they are not one setting and copying one into the other would be wrong.
//! - **[`CMD_RESOLVE_ID`] is not answered.** A client that sends it gets no context back, which is
//!   what the reference does for a command it does not implement. Since [`VOLUME_RESOLVE_ID`] is
//!   never advertised, no conforming client should send it.
//! - **The context is answered on every CREATE that carries it**, not only the first of a tree
//!   connect. The exchange holds no state, so a client that re-asks gets the same answer; that is
//!   cheaper than remembering, and no client re-asks.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. `apple` is provisional, minted by milestone 55's lane on 2026-08-17. It is a
//! noun, it is the vendor whose extensions these are, and the alternative that suggested itself
//! (`fruit`, after Samba's module) names the reference implementation rather than the thing.
