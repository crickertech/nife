//! **The seam between the SMB state machine and whatever holds the files.**
//!
//! Milestone 54's block names the shape: the adapter holds one directory capability and one
//! network endpoint. [`Share`] is the directory-capability side of that seam, drawn so the
//! protocol machine ([`crate::server`]) never knows what backs it: the host tests and the QEMU
//! gate serve a [`FixtureShare`] (files baked into the binary), and the filesystem_proto-backed
//! implementation, which walks a real directory capability into the FS server, implements this
//! same trait in the server program where the IPC lives.
//!
//! The model is deliberately smaller than a filesystem: a **tree of directories and files**,
//! readable always and writable when the backing says so. No timestamps (everything reports the
//! epoch), no attributes beyond file-versus-directory, no links. Each absence is a `BUGS`-grade
//! limitation of milestone 54's scope, not of the trait: growing the model is adding methods,
//! which is cheap next to the wire format.
//!
//! # What subdirectories changed here, and why (milestone 54's third act)
//!
//! The share was **flat** until this: every method took a bare name, [`Node`] had one directory in
//! it (`Root`), and `smb_proto::server` refused any name containing a separator. A Time Machine
//! sparsebundle is a directory of band files, so the flat model cannot hold the thing milestone 55
//! exists to serve. Three contract changes, and each one is the smallest that makes a tree
//! expressible:
//!
//! - **Every name-taking method takes a [`Path`] instead of a `&[u8]`.** Not a formality: a `Path`
//!   cannot be constructed without going through [`crate::path::Path::parse`], so a backing cannot
//!   be handed `..` even by an implementation that forgot to check. The traversal refusal is a wire
//!   decision and lives at the wire (see that module's header).
//! - **A directory is an opened object with an id**, [`DirId`], exactly as a file is. [`ROOT_DIR`]
//!   is the share root, which the backing neither mints nor closes, mirroring `filesystem_proto`'s
//!   `fs::ROOT` because the fs-backed share makes them literally the same number.
//! - **[`Share::entry`] takes the directory to list.** It listed "the share" before, which was
//!   expressible only because there was one directory.
//!
//! [`Share::mkdir`] and [`Share::rmdir`] are the two new verbs, and they are separate from
//! [`Share::create`] and [`Share::remove`] rather than folded into them for `filesystem_proto`'s reason: a
//! call that removes whatever it finds is how one word destroys a subtree, and this contract does
//! not offer it at any name.
//!
//! # What the write path changed here, and why (milestone 54's second half)
//!
//! Two contract changes, both forced by the same fact: **a writable share's listing moves.**
//!
//! - **A file is named by an opaque [`FileId`] the backing mints at open, not by its index in the
//!   listing.** The read-only trait let `Node::File(usize)` mean "the `i`th entry", which was
//!   sound only because nothing could reorder the directory. Create one file and every index
//!   after it shifts, so every open handle would silently start reading a different file. An
//!   identity the backing assigns is the fix, and it retires the re-open-per-request cost the
//!   read path's `BUGS` recorded: the fs-backed share now keeps the FS server's handle in the id.
//! - **Every fallible call carries an [`Error`]**, which the read path's `BUGS` named as missing:
//!   a refusal used to arrive on the wire as "no such file" and a failed read as EOF, so a client
//!   could not tell a capability refusal from an absence. A write path cannot afford that; a
//!   backup client that reads "your write succeeded, zero bytes" loses data quietly.
//!
//! # Read-only is a property of the share, checked before the backing is asked
//!
//! [`Share::writable`] has **no default**, so a backing cannot be written without saying which it
//! is, and [`crate::server`] refuses every mutating command on a share that answers `false`
//! *before* it calls the backing. That ordering is the point (the milestone's brief says so): a
//! read-only share must refuse at the protocol layer, with the status a client acts on, rather
//! than passing the request down and hoping the filesystem says no. The mutating methods here
//! then default to [`Error::ReadOnly`] as a second, independent line, so a backing that
//! implements nothing is read-only by construction rather than by remembering.
