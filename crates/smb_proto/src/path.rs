//! **Share-relative paths, parsed once at the wire's edge** (milestone 54's subdirectory half).
//!
//! The share was flat until this module existed: [`crate::server`] rejected any name containing a
//! backslash with `STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND` and the [`crate::share::Share`] trait took a bare
//! name. A Time Machine sparsebundle is a **directory of band files**, so a flat share cannot hold
//! one, which makes this the largest single piece between milestone 54 and milestone 55.
//!
//! # Why the parsing is here and not in the backing
//!
//! Everything in this module is a decision about **what a client is allowed to say**, and that is
//! wire format: a path traversal is a wire attack, and `..` must die at the edge rather than
//! wherever a backing happens to look at it. Keeping it in this crate is rule 7 (AGENTS.md), and it
//! is what makes the refusals below host-testable and Kani-reachable rather than buried in a
//! `no_std` binary.
//!
//! So a backing never sees a raw client string. It receives a [`Path`], which is a type that cannot
//! be constructed without going through [`Path::parse`], and therefore cannot hold `..`, an empty
//! component, or a separator it would have to split on again.
//!
//! # The refusals, and what each one is for
//!
//! - **`..` is [`PathError::Traversal`]**, refused rather than resolved. Resolving it would mean
//!   this crate deciding what is above the share root, and the whole capability argument is that
//!   there is no above: `filesystem_proto`'s `OPENDIR` answers `EINVAL` for a name that is not a single
//!   component for the same reason. Refusing is also the only answer that stays correct if a
//!   component is a symlink one day.
//! - **`.` is [`PathError::Traversal`] too.** It is harmless to resolve and it is not harmless to
//!   *accept*: a client that sends `a\.\b` and one that sends `a\b` would then name the same file by
//!   two paths, and this share's handles carry their path as their identity (rename and
//!   delete-on-close both read it back). One path per name is cheaper to hold than a canonicaliser.
//! - **An empty component is [`PathError::Empty`]**, which is what `a\\b` and a leading `\\` are.
//!   The one exception is a **trailing** separator, which is stripped: clients do send `dir\`, and
//!   refusing it would be pedantry with a real cost.
//! - **A forward slash is [`PathError::Separator`].** SMB's separator is `\`; `/` is a character
//!   Windows forbids in a name and Unix uses as a separator, so accepting it would let one client
//!   address a file that another client, and the filesystem underneath, spell differently.
//! - **Over-long is [`PathError::TooLong`]**, per component ([`MAX_COMPONENT`]) and for the whole
//!   path ([`MAX_PATH`]). Both are this share's bounds rather than the filesystem's: a handle keeps
//!   its own copy of its path, so the bound is what a connection's handle table costs.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The reserved characters SMB forbids in a name are not checked** (`:` `*` `?` `"` `<` `>`
//!   `|`). A client that creates `a?b` gets a file called `a?b` on the filesystem, which no Windows
//!   client will be able to open afterwards. The filesystem takes the name, so this is a
//!   compatibility gap rather than a safety one, and it is recorded rather than fixed because
//!   nothing macOS sends contains them.
//! - **Case is folded before this module runs**, by [`crate::utf16le_to_ascii_lower`], so
//!   `Bands\1A` and `bands\1a` are the same path here and the second is what reaches the
//!   filesystem. The crate BUGS already record that an upper-case name on disk is unreachable; a
//!   path makes that true per component.
//! - **Depth is bounded only by [`MAX_PATH`].** A path of 64 one-byte components is legal, and the
//!   fs-backed share pays one `OPENDIR` per component to walk it, so a deep path is a slow one.
//!   Nothing refuses it, because there is no depth at which the answer becomes wrong.
