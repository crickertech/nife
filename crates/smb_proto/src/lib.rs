#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]
// milestone 68's ratchet is workspace-wide (§107); this crate opts out until its 52-item
// worklist (notes/doc-coverage.md) is burned down.
#![allow(missing_docs)]
//! **The SMB2 wire format, and the server logic that speaks it** (milestone 54).
//!
//! macOS mounts SMB natively, and milestone 55 (a Time Machine target) requires SMB regardless, so
//! SMB is the one network file protocol this tree carries (design/roadmap/54-network-file-service.md
//! settles it). This crate is the whole of the wire: framing, header, every request parse and
//! response build, NTLMSSP and the minimal SPNEGO wrapping macOS puts around it, and the
//! per-connection state machine ([`server::Connection`]) that turns one inbound SMB2 message into
//! one response. The `smb_server` role in `user/src/smb_server.rs` owns only the IO: sockets in,
//! bytes to this crate, bytes out.
//!
//! That split is rule 7 and the tree's whole method: every byte offset in this protocol is a thing
//! two programs must agree on (the expensive-to-reverse category), so it lives here, host-tested,
//! with the client-side builders ([`client`]) in the same crate so the tests and xtask's host-side
//! prober exercise the same constants the server answers with. No party keeps its own copy.
//!
//! # Scope, honestly
//!
//! The dialect is **SMB 2.1 only** (`DIALECT_0210`), chosen deliberately: 2.0.2 predates features
//! macOS wants, and the 3.x family drags in signing enforcement, encryption, and
//! `VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO`, none of which a first mount needs. Sessions are **guest only**: the
//! server answers the NTLMSSP exchange so a client can complete it, and then admits everyone as
//! guest without checking anything, which is what "anonymous first, identity later" means
//! concretely (the `cred`/`ntlm` machinery from milestone 65 is the recorded next step; nothing
//! here stores or checks a secret, per DECISIONS §79's constraints on credential material). The
//! share is a **tree** of directories and files, readable always and writable when its backing says
//! so ([`share::Share::writable`]); a read-only share refuses every mutating command **at this
//! layer**, before the backing is asked. See the `BUGS` section at the bottom of this header.
//!
//! **Paths are parsed here, once, at the edge** ([`path`]). A traversal is a wire attack, so `..`
//! is refused where the bytes arrive rather than wherever a backing happens to look at it, and the
//! [`share::Share`] seam takes a [`path::Path`] that cannot be constructed without that check.
//!
//! **Apple's extensions arrive through the one door SMB2 has for them** ([`create_context`], the
//! chain a CREATE hangs its extensions off, and [`apple`], which is what the `AAPL` tag in that
//! chain means). That is milestone 55's first piece: macOS mounts a plain share happily and will
//! not offer one as a Time Machine destination without this exchange. Every claim it makes is a
//! claim a client acts on, so [`apple`]'s header lists each bit and why it is set or left clear,
//! and its `BUGS` is honest about the one that reaches past what the stack backs.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A whole mount, on the host, in microseconds. This is what the `smb_server` role does with a
//! socket underneath and nothing else: bytes in, [`server::Connection::handle`], bytes out.
//!
//! ```
//! use smb_proto::{
//!     H_SESSION_ID, H_STATUS, H_TREE_ID, MAX_MESSAGE, STATUS_SUCCESS, authenticator::NoIdentity,
//!     client, r32, r64, server::Connection, share::FIXTURE,
//! };
//!
//! // One request through the state machine, the way a socket loop would drive it.
//! fn exchange(c: &mut Connection, request: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
//!     let mut out = vec![0u8; MAX_MESSAGE];
//!     let n = c
//!         .handle(request, &mut out, &FIXTURE, &NoIdentity)
//!         .expect("SMB2 in, SMB2 out");
//!     out.truncate(n);
//!     out
//! }
//!
//! // The challenge is the connection's, and a real server takes it from the entropy service.
//! let mut c = Connection::new([0xA5; 8]);
//!
//! let resp = exchange(&mut c, &client::negotiate(1));
//! assert_eq!(client::negotiate_dialect(&resp), smb_proto::DIALECT_0210);
//!
//! // Two round trips: the client asks, the server challenges, the client answers. Nothing checks
//! // the answer, which is what "guest only" means and why it is the first entry under BUGS.
//! let resp = exchange(&mut c, &client::session_setup_negotiate(2));
//! let sid = r64(&resp, H_SESSION_ID);
//! let resp = exchange(&mut c, &client::session_setup_authenticate(3, sid));
//! assert_eq!(r32(&resp, H_STATUS), STATUS_SUCCESS);
//!
//! let resp = exchange(&mut c, &client::tree_connect(4, sid, b"\\\\10.0.2.15\\share"));
//! let tid = r32(&resp, H_TREE_ID);
//!
//! // Open a file and read it.
//! let resp = exchange(&mut c, &client::create(5, sid, tid, b"hello.txt"));
//! let fid = client::create_file_id(&resp);
//! let resp = exchange(&mut c, &client::read(6, sid, tid, &fid, 0, 64));
//! assert_eq!(client::read_data(&resp), b"nife serves SMB\n");
//!
//! // A read at end of file is END_OF_FILE, not an empty success. That distinction is what ends a
//! // client's read loop, so getting it wrong is a hang rather than a wrong answer.
//! let resp = exchange(&mut c, &client::read(7, sid, tid, &fid, 16, 64));
//! assert_eq!(r32(&resp, H_STATUS), smb_proto::STATUS_END_OF_FILE);
//! ```
//!
//! The other thing worth showing is [`path`], because it is where a wire attack dies. A Time Machine
//! sparsebundle is a directory of band files, so the share has to be a tree, and the moment it is a
//! tree a client can try to walk out of it:
//!
//! ```
//! use smb_proto::path::{Path, PathError};
//!
//! // What a Mac writing a backup actually sends.
//! let p = Path::parse(b"corinne.sparsebundle\\bands\\1a2b").unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(p.depth(), 3);
//! assert_eq!(p.name(), b"1a2b");
//! assert_eq!(p.parent().as_bytes(), b"corinne.sparsebundle\\bands");
//!
//! // `..` is refused, not resolved: the capability argument is that there is no "above" to
//! // resolve to, and refusing stays correct if a component is a symlink one day.
//! assert_eq!(Path::parse(b"bands\\..\\..\\etc\\passwd"), Err(PathError::Traversal));
//!
//! // `.` is refused too, for a different reason: accepting it would give one file two names, and
//! // this share's handles carry their path as their identity.
//! assert_eq!(Path::parse(b"bands\\.\\0"), Err(PathError::Traversal));
//!
//! // A forward slash is not this protocol's separator, so accepting it would let two clients
//! // spell one file two ways.
//! assert_eq!(Path::parse(b"bands/0"), Err(PathError::Separator));
//!
//! // But a trailing separator is stripped, because clients really do send `dir\`.
//! assert_eq!(Path::parse(b"bands\\").unwrap().as_bytes(), b"bands");
//!
//! // The root is the one path with no components, and its parent is itself.
//! assert!(Path::ROOT.is_root());
//! assert_eq!(Path::ROOT.parent(), Path::ROOT);
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Guest only, and guest means everyone.** Every AUTHENTICATE is accepted and flagged as a
//!   guest session. There is no user database, no proof check, and no signing. Do not put anything
//!   on a share this serves that the local network may not read, **and now that writes exist,
//!   nothing you would mind the local network changing.**
//! - **Free space is nominal only when the backing has no volume to ask.** A backing that can
//!   answer [`share::Share::statfs`] is reported verbatim (the fs-backed share does, through
//!   `filesystem_proto::fs::STATFS`); [`share::FixtureShare`] is files baked into a binary and has no
//!   volume, so it falls back to [`share::NOMINAL_VOLUME_BYTES`]. The number is a **forecast**
//!   either way: a write past the real end of the image still fails with [`STATUS_DISK_FULL`] at
//!   the write, because free space is not a reservation.
//! - **A read-only share reports zero free space**, whatever its backing says. That matches
//!   `READ_ONLY_VOLUME` one field over, and a client that believed the real count would try a write
//!   this server refuses anyway.
//! - **Timestamps on a directory are the epoch too**, for the file case's reason below, so a
//!   listing sorted by date is sorted by nothing.
//! - **Nothing enforces a depth limit**, only the total path length ([`path::MAX_PATH`]). A deep
//!   path costs the fs-backed share one descent per component, so it is slow rather than refused.
//! - **`SET_INFO`'s `FileRenameInformation` ignores a nonzero `RootDirectory`** and answers
//!   [`STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED`]. The destination is a share-relative path, which is what every client
//!   sends.
//! - **Timestamps are accepted and discarded.** `SET_INFO`'s `FileBasicInformation` succeeds and
//!   changes nothing, because this server holds no clock capability and `filesystem_proto`'s `FSTAT`
//!   carries no times. A client that sets a modification time and reads it back gets the epoch.
//! - **`FileAllocationInformation` is a no-op**, deliberately: preallocation is a hint, and
//!   turning it into a truncate would zero-extend a file a client was about to write into.
//! - **No credit or message-id accounting.** Credits granted are whatever was asked (at least 1),
//!   and message ids are echoed, never validated. A well-behaved client is fine; a hostile one can
//!   replay. The listener re-arms between connections, so one bad connection costs one connection.
//! - **ASCII names only.** SMB names are UTF-16LE; this crate matches names whose code units are
//!   all ASCII and treats anything else as not found. Same shape as `ntlm`'s uppercasing bug: a
//!   wrong answer rather than a crash, named here where the reader meets it.
//! - **`ReplaceIfExists = 0` is ignored on a rename**, so a rename always replaces a destination of
//!   the same kind. `filesystem_proto::fs::RENAME` offers no way to refuse a collision (its own doc gives
//!   §42's reason for declining `renameat2`'s `NOREPLACE`), so a client that asked for the rename
//!   to fail gets a silent overwrite. The wrong direction to fail in, and the fix is in the
//!   filesystem contract rather than here.
//! - **No share modes, no oplocks, no leases.** `ShareAccess` is parsed off the wire and never
//!   consulted, so nothing is ever a sharing violation. That is why `fruit:posix_rename` needed no
//!   work; it is also why two clients writing one file get whatever the filesystem gives them.
//! - **One connection served at a time** (the `smb_server` role's shape, recorded here because the
//!   protocol allows more): the socket contract is synchronous and `MAX_SOCKETS` is 4, so this is
//!   a per-connection state machine, not a multiplexer. macOS opens one connection per mount.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Provisional, minted by milestone 54's lane on 2026-08-15, following the
//! `filesystem_proto`/`socket_proto`/`graphics_proto` pattern (a protocol contract crate takes the protocol's
//! standard name plus the `_proto` suffix). `smb` is a term of art in the family the naming tenet
//! says are already right (`elf`, `pci`, `ntlm`).
