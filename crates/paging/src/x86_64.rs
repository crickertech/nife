//! **The type is called `Ia32e` rather than `X86_64` on purpose.** "IA-32e paging" is Intel's own
//! name for this mode (SDM volume 3, chapter 4), so it is a term a reader already knows from
//! outside this tree, which is the naming tenet's protected class. The mechanical reason is smaller
//! and also real: `X86_64` is not camel case and `non_camel_case_types` is on. The module keeps the
//! architecture's name, matching [`aarch64`](crate::aarch64) beside it. Name provisional.
//!
//! # What this format does differently from the other two, and it is one thing
//!
//! **Permissions are inherited down the walk, not stated at the leaf.** On aarch64 and Sv39 an
//! intermediate entry carries no rights and the leaf is the single source of truth, which is why
//! [`PageFormat::table_entry`] takes no flags. x86 is the opposite: the effective permission for an
//! access is the **AND** of every level's `U/S`, `R/W` and (for NX, the OR of) `XD` bits. A leaf
//! that says "user, writable" under a PML4 entry that says "supervisor, read-only" is
//! supervisor-only and read-only.
//!
//! So this implementation makes intermediate entries **maximally permissive** (present, writable,
//! user, executable) and lets the leaf decide, which reproduces the other two formats' semantics
//! exactly and is what makes the shared [`Mapper`](crate::Mapper) walk correct here without knowing
//! any of this. That is a deliberate trade and it has a cost worth naming: the hierarchical bits are
//! a real x86 mechanism for revoking a whole subtree in one store, and this format gives it up in
//! exchange for one meaning of "what does this mapping grant" across three architectures. A future
//! subtree-revocation optimisation would have to reintroduce it, and would then have to explain
//! itself to `translate`, which reads the leaf alone.
//!
//! # NX depends on a bit outside the page tables
//!
//! Bit 63 means "no execute" only while `IA32_EFER.NXE` is set; with NXE clear it is a **reserved**
//! bit and setting it makes the entry faulting rather than non-executable. The kernel's boot
//! trampoline sets NXE before it builds any table (`arch/x86_64/boot.s`), which is the ordering
//! that makes this encoding safe. Nothing in this crate can check it, which is why it is said here.
