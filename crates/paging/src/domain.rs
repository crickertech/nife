//! **The portable DMA-domain seam** (milestone 16b; DECISIONS §20).
//!
//! An IOMMU confines a device by translating every address it emits through page tables the kernel
//! programs, in the CPU's own page-table format: SMMUv3 walks VMSAv8-64 tables (the aarch64 format,
//! [`Aarch64`](crate::Aarch64)); the RISC-V IOMMU walks Sv39 ([`Sv39`](crate::Sv39)). Those are the
//! *same two formats* [`Mapper`] already builds for process address spaces, so a DMA domain is not a
//! new kind of table. It is an [`Mapper`] filled with an identity map over exactly the frames the
//! device is allowed to reach, and nothing else.
//!
//! # Why identity, and why the low half
//!
//! The userspace virtio driver already puts *physical* addresses into its descriptors (its DMA
//! region's frames, and the kernel's shadow page). With an IOMMU in front, the device emits those
//! same numbers as **IOVAs**, and the domain translates each IOVA to the identical PA. An address
//! the driver was never granted has no mapping, so the IOMMU faults instead of letting the DMA
//! through. That is the whole confinement, now in hardware: the domain is an allow-list of frames,
//! expressed as a page table. The driver's ABI does not change, because IOVA == PA means the
//! addresses it computes still name the right memory. (Both `virt` boards place RAM in the low half:
//! aarch64 at `0x4000_0000`, riscv at `0x8000_0000`, both far below either format's [`Half`] split.)
//!
//! # The RISC-V U-bit, stated once
//!
//! A single-stage (`iosatp`, no process context) RISC-V IOMMU translation faults on a leaf PTE
//! whose U bit is clear, because the device is not "requesting supervisor privilege". So the domain
//! is built with [`Flags::user_data`], which sets U on Sv39 and read/write on both formats. It is a
//! device's data window, so user-accessible read/write with no execute is exactly right.

///   "inside the grant" is not even a statement that can be made about it, let alone proved. That is

// Machine-checked proofs (Kani): **the domain maps exactly the grant.** Milestone 35 item 3.
//
// The property wanted is the hardware sibling of the DMA validator's: a device's domain maps
// precisely the frames it was granted and nothing else. Stated over the *built page tables* it is a
// `Mapper` build-and-translate round trip over a symbolic IOVA, which is the BMC-over-real-memory
// wall notes/verification.md declined for the ELF parser and for `Mapper` itself. So it is
// decomposed, the way that note says to decompose ("prefer refactoring the logic to shrinking the
// proof"): the *page set* the builder feeds the mapper is loopless arithmetic, and that is proved
// here for every region and every index. What the harnesses give, in the two directions that matter:
//
//   soundness (the security direction): every page the builder maps lies wholly inside a granted
//     region, so no ungranted byte becomes device-reachable;
//   completeness (the functional direction): every whole page of a granted region is mapped, so the
//     confinement does not silently starve an honest driver;
//   injectivity: no page is enumerated twice, so a build cannot fail `AlreadyMapped` against itself;
//   totality: the arithmetic never panics or wraps, for any base, size, or index.
//
// This is format-independent, which is the right shape for a §19 parity gate: one proof covers the
// SMMUv3 (VMSAv8-64) domain and the RISC-V IOMMU (Sv39) domain, because the page set does not depend
// on the format. What is *not* proved here is the remaining link, "`Mapper::map` writes exactly one
// leaf for the page it is told and touches nothing else." That stays underwritten by the proved walk
// arithmetic (`index_is_always_in_bounds`, `distinct_pages_take_distinct_paths`, the leaf codec on
// both formats) plus this module's build-and-translate tests below, on both formats. notes/dma.md
// states that residual plainly.
