//! Page tables, portable across formats.
//!
//! Two hardware page-table formats live under this crate: the aarch64 descriptor format
//! ([`Aarch64`], four levels) and RISC-V Sv39 ([`Sv39`], three levels). They share everything that
//! matters and differ only in the bits: the *walk* (descend the levels, allocate tables, write a
//! leaf) is written once in [`Mapper`], and each format supplies the handful of encode/decode
//! operations the walk needs through the [`PageFormat`] trait. See notes/riscv-port.md (leak #2) for
//! why this seam exists and DECISIONS §17.
//!
//! Both formats use 512-entry, 4 KiB tables and 4 KiB pages, because both were designed around the
//! same arithmetic: 9 index bits selects one of 512 eight-byte entries, so **a table is exactly one
//! page** and the frame allocator can supply page tables and nothing else.
//!
//! # Blocks: a leaf one or two levels up
//!
//! The same arithmetic gives every format a second and third leaf size for free. An entry one level
//! above the bottom covers 512 pages (2 MiB), one level above that 512 of those (1 GiB), and all
//! three formats let such an entry be a **leaf** that maps the whole span directly instead of
//! pointing at a table. aarch64 calls it a *block* descriptor, Sv39 a megapage or gigapage, x86 a
//! large page (`PS`). [`PageSize`] names the three sizes and [`Mapper::map_span`] picks the largest
//! one that fits, which is what a direct map of physical memory wants: in 4 KiB leaves it costs 8
//! bytes of table per 4 KiB of RAM (0.2%), in 2 MiB leaves 8 bytes per 2 MiB.
//!
//! **A block is a leaf the walk meets early, and every walk has to know that.** `map` refuses to
//! descend through one (it would read a 2 MiB frame of somebody's data as a page table and write a
//! leaf into it), `unmap` refuses to take a 4 KiB bite out of one ([`MapError::InsideBlock`]), and
//! `translate` stops at one and adds the offset within it. None of the three splits a block: doing
//! that on a live table is valid-to-valid on aarch64, which is the break-before-make hazard
//! [`TlbFlush`] exists for, and nothing in this tree has needed it.
//!
//! # Why this is a separate crate
//!
//! It is pure logic: addresses in, descriptors out. The host tests build real page tables in real
//! memory (using host allocations as pretend physical frames, which works because the pointer
//! arithmetic is identical) and walk them back. Milliseconds, no emulator. DECISIONS §7.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Real aarch64 page tables, in real memory, on the host. The trick is in the section above: a
//! `Box<PageTable>` is 4 KiB-aligned because the type says so, so its address serves as a
//! "physical" frame and `phys_to_ptr` is the identity cast. **The pointer arithmetic is bit-for-bit
//! what the kernel does.**
//!
//! ```
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//!
//! use paging::{Aarch64, Flags, Half, MapError, Mapper, PageTable};
//!
//! fn phys_to_ptr(pa: u64) -> *mut PageTable {
//!     pa as *mut PageTable
//! }
//!
//! // The pretend frame allocator, with a receipt so nothing leaks.
//! let tables: RefCell<Vec<*mut PageTable>> = RefCell::new(Vec::new());
//! let mut fresh = || {
//!     let p = Box::into_raw(Box::new(PageTable::new()));
//!     tables.borrow_mut().push(p);
//!     p as u64
//! };
//! let root = fresh();
//!
//! // SAFETY: `root` is a fresh, zeroed, 4 KiB-aligned table, and `phys_to_ptr` is the identity,
//! // which is correct because these "physical" addresses ARE host addresses.
//! let mut m: Mapper<_, fn(u64) -> *mut PageTable, Aarch64> = unsafe {
//!     Mapper::new(
//!         root,
//!         Half::Low,
//!         || Some(fresh()),
//!         phys_to_ptr as fn(u64) -> *mut PageTable,
//!     )

//! assert_eq!(pa, 0x4000_0000);
//! assert!(flags.is_user_executable() && !flags.is_writable());

//! ```
//!
//! W^X is worth stating as a claim about what is **absent**, over every constructor there is:
//!
//! ```
//! use paging::Flags;
//!
//! for f in [
//!     Flags::kernel_code(),
//!     Flags::kernel_rodata(),

//!     if f.is_user_accessible() {
//!         assert!(!f.is_kernel_executable());
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The user-VA gate is a conjunction, and the aligned high-half address is the case that tells `&&`
//! from `||`: an or-gate here would admit a kernel address to a user `MAP` request.
//!

/// # Why this type exists at all
///
/// The CPU caches translations in a TLB. Change a mapping without invalidating it and **the CPU
/// keeps using the old translation**. Memory reads back as the *previous* owner's data. That is a
/// security hole, and close to undebuggable: the page tables *in memory are correct*; it is the
/// CPU's private cache of them that is stale, and you cannot look at it.
///
/// So `unmap` doesn't just do the work and trust you to remember. It hands you an obligation.
/// `#[must_use]` means dropping it on the floor is a compiler warning, and the only ways to
/// discharge it are [`flush`](Self::flush) (do the invalidation) or
/// [`assume_no_stale_entry`](Self::assume_no_stale_entry), which is `unsafe` and makes you say why.
///
/// # Break-before-make
///
/// The other half of the discipline, and the reason [`MapError::AlreadyMapped`] exists rather than
/// `map` silently overwriting. Changing a **valid** entry directly into a *different* **valid** one
/// is architecturally unsafe (a TLB conflict): you must go valid → invalid → invalidate → valid.
/// Refusing to overwrite an existing mapping is what forces that sequence. **The API cannot be used
/// incorrectly**, rather than merely documenting the rule and hoping.
///
/// # What does NOT need one
///
/// Mapping a page that was **invalid** before: the hardware may not cache an entry that would fault,
/// so there is no stale entry to invalidate. That is why `map` returns `()` and not this.
