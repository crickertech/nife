//! The ASID allocator: **which number tags this address space's TLB entries.**
//!
//! Milestone 15 (design/roadmap/15-asids.md). An ASID (Address Space IDentifier) is a small number the
//! hardware attaches to every TLB entry created from a non-global (`nG`) mapping, and compares
//! on every lookup against the ASID in `TTBR0_EL1`'s top bits. With every user mapping tagged,
//! a context switch stops flushing anything: entries from other address spaces simply stop
//! matching. Before this, every switch ran `tlbi vmalle1is`, discarding every EL1 translation
//! on every core, the kernel's included.
//!
//! # Why a bitmap and not Linux's generation scheme
//!
//! Linux allocates ASIDs by *generation*: processes outnumber ASIDs (256 or 65536), so on
//! exhaustion it bumps a generation counter, flushes everything once, and lazily re-assigns.
//! That machinery guards one case: more live address spaces than ASID numbers. **Our own bounds
//! make that case unreachable**: milestone 14 fixed concurrent address spaces at `MAX_SPACES`
//! (160), below even the smallest hardware ASID space (8-bit, 256). So each address space keeps
//! one ASID for its whole life, allocation is a bitmap scan, and the rollover path that could
//! never be honestly exercised was never built. If `MAX_SPACES` ever outgrows 255, the fix is one
//! TCR bit (16-bit ASIDs) before it is ever a new algorithm.
//!
//! # The invariant the caller keeps
//!
//! Reusing a number is only safe once the TLB holds no entries tagged with it, **on every core**.
//! The kernel invalidates by ASID in `AddressSpace::drop`, *before* calling
//! [`free`](Allocator::free). This crate proves the numbers are managed soundly; the flush is
//! the kernel's half of the contract, stated at the call site.
//!
//! **How much work that half is depends entirely on the ISA**, which milestone 58 made plain.
//! aarch64's `tlbi aside1is` broadcasts across the inner-shareable domain in hardware, so the
//! contract is one instruction. RISC-V's `sfence.vma` affects only the hart that runs it, so the
//! same sentence becomes a distributed protocol: a local fence, an SBI RFENCE IPI to every other
//! online hart, and an acknowledgement before the number may be handed on. See
//! notes/riscv-tlb-shootdown.md.
//!
//! The other half of the assumption below is also an aarch64 fact and not a universal one: the
//! architecture *mandates* at least 8 ASID bits there, and RISC-V permits **zero**. So the RISC-V
//! kernel probes `satp.ASID`'s implemented width at boot and keeps flushing on every switch if it
//! is narrower than the numbers this crate hands out.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use asid::Allocator;
//!
//! let mut a = Allocator::new();
//! let first = a.alloc().expect("a fresh allocator has one to give");
//! let second = a.alloc().expect("and another");
//! assert_ne!(first, second, "two live address spaces never share an ASID");
//!
//! // Freeing puts it back in circulation.
//! a.free(first);
//! assert!(a.alloc().is_some());
//! ```
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, the naming tenet in CLAUDE.md). Named in the group of standard
//! terms that are already right and must not be touched, because a name a reader knows from outside
//! this project costs nothing to learn and renaming it would destroy the recognition the tenet
//! exists to buy. It is also the entry in `script/lint`'s `-d` allow-list, with its expansion
//! (Address Space IDentifier) as the reason.
