//! **The work-steal request slot**: the one lock-free, cross-core handshake in the scheduler.
//!
//! An idle core wants work. It cannot reach into a loaded core's run queue, and that is deliberate
//! (DECISIONS §11: a remote core cannot even *name* another core's queue, which is what forces
//! cross-core work movement onto the inbox/SGI path). So stealing is a **message**, not a reach:
//! the idle core parks a request in the victim's slot and pokes it with a reschedule interrupt, and
//! the victim, at its next scheduler entry, hands one thread back into the requester's inbox
//! (DECISIONS §28.3).
//!
//! Everything else in that path is under a lock. The migration inbox is an `IrqSafeMutex`; the run
//! queue is single-owner with interrupts masked; the thread table is under `IPC_TABLES`. **This slot is
//! the exception**, and that is why it is lifted here: it is a hand-rolled compare-exchange plus a
//! swap, the kind of protocol that is correct on a total-store-order machine and wrong on a weakly
//! ordered one, and this project runs on two weakly ordered ISAs (CLAUDE.md rule 4).
//!
//! # The protocol, in full
//!
//! One `u32`, biased by one so that zero can mean *empty*:
//!
//! ```text
//!   0          nobody is asking
//!   id + 1     core `id` is asking, and has not been served yet
//! ```
//!
//! - A thief **claims** the slot with a compare-exchange from zero. Only one can win, so a crowd of
//!   idle cores collapses to one outstanding request per victim per round. A thief that loses does
//!   not queue behind the winner; it simply asks again next time round its idle loop.
//! - A victim **takes** the slot with a swap to zero, which reads and clears in one step. Clearing
//!   is what lets the next idle core in, so a take that is not followed by a hand-off still makes
//!   progress: the requester asks again, and meanwhile nobody else is blocked out.
//!
//! # Why the orderings are what they are
//!
//! The claim is a **release** and the take is an **acquire**, so they pair: everything the thief
//! wrote before claiming is visible to the victim that takes the claim. The kernel does not yet put
//! anything in that window (a request carries only the requester's identity, and the identity is
//! inside the compare-exchange itself), so the pairing is not carrying a payload today. It is here
//! because the slot is a *mailbox*, and the moment a request grows a field (a count, a deadline, a
//! class of work) the pairing is what makes that field safe to read. `notes/interleaving.md` records
//! the loom run that falsifies the relaxed spelling, so this is a checked claim rather than a
//! cautious one.
//!
//! The failed-compare-exchange ordering is **relaxed** on purpose: a thief that loses the race
//! learns nothing it acts on. It returns to its idle loop and tries again.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! The two halves of one round, as the kernel spells them:
//!
//! ```
//! use work_steal_slot::Slot;
//!
//! // On core 3, idle, having picked core 0 as the most loaded victim:
//! let victim_slot = Slot::new();
//! assert!(victim_slot.claim(3));           // ... then send core 0 a reschedule interrupt
//!
//! // A second idle core, core 5, finds the slot already spoken for and moves on:
//! assert!(!victim_slot.claim(5));
//!
//! // On core 0, at its next scheduler entry:
//! assert_eq!(victim_slot.take(), Some(3)); // ... then pop one thread into core 3's inbox
//! assert_eq!(victim_slot.take(), None);    // and the slot is open again
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A take that finds an empty run queue silently drops the request.** The victim clears the
//!   slot before it looks for a thread to give, so a thief that asks a core which has just run its
//!   last queued thread gets nothing and is not told. That is by design (DECISIONS §28.3 calls it
//!   the bounded cost of an empty give) and it is safe because the idle loop retries on the next
//!   timer tick, but it means **this type promises delivery of the request, never of a thread**.
//! - **A slot is only as live as the victim's scheduler entries.** If a victim is poked and never
//!   reaches a scheduler entry, its slot stays claimed and every other idle core is locked out of
//!   it until it does. Nothing here can check that, and neither can loom: the reschedule interrupt
//!   is outside the model. See `notes/interleaving.md`.
//! - **The identity is not authenticated.** Any core may claim any slot as any id. Nothing in the
//!   kernel can forge one (the only caller passes its own `cpu::id()`), but the type does not
//!   enforce it.
//! - [`MAX_REQUESTER`] exists because the bias is an addition, and an addition can overflow. No
//!   kernel configuration can reach it (`MAX_CPUS` is single digits), so the branch that refuses it
//!   is unreachable in the running system and is covered by a host test alone.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-23 (calef, a kernel-dependency crate naming review). Renamed from
//! `steal_request`: not a proper noun phrase as named (the primary type is `Slot`, not
//! `StealRequest`); "work-steal" as a compound modifier matches standard scheduling terminology
//! (Cilk, Go, Rayon). The type is `Slot` and the methods are `claim`/`take`.
//! `notes/interleaving.md` records why it was lifted into its own crate.
