//! Reading the ISA out of real and hand-written device trees, on the host, in milliseconds.

//! Four trees, and each is here for a reason no other one covers:
//!
//! * **QEMU's own `virt`**, borrowed from the `dtb` crate's fixtures so the two crates cannot
//!   disagree about what the machine we test on says. This is the tree the RISC-V suite actually
//!   boots against, and the surprise in it is the whole argument for the milestone.
//! * **`mixed-cpus`**, hand-written, for the shapes QEMU never produces: the deprecated
//!   `riscv,isa` string, the `g` abbreviation, and harts that differ from each other.
//! * **`narrow-machine`**, hand-written, so the refusal path has a witness rather than only a
//!   comment saying it would refuse.
//! * **`wide-hart-first`**, hand-written, with the wide hart ahead of the narrow one, because the
//!   other trees happen to declare their narrowest hart first and would forgive a loop that never
//!   replaces an answer it already holds.
