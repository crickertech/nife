//! The vendor tree the VisionFive 2 actually serves, and its two lies, on the host.
//!
//! Second first-silicon stop (bench, 2026-08-14; notes/visionfive2.md). The board's flashed
//! firmware hands over a tree that marks the S-incapable S7 monitor core `status = "okay"` with
//! `mmu-type = "riscv,sv39"`, both false, so the `status` gate the mainline-shaped fixture proves
//! (`riscv64_jh7110.rs`) never fires on the real board: hart 0 read as startable, the kernel
//! called `sbi hart_start` on it, and vendor OpenSBI died in M-mode. These tests hold the rule
//! built from that crash: startability, the machine record, and the PLIC expectations all follow
//! the hart's own `riscv,isa`, whose missing bare `s` is the node's one truthful property.
//!
//! The two fixtures deliberately assert the same conclusion (the S7 is not startable and does not
//! speak for the machine) through different lies: mainline's S7 is excluded by `status`, the
//! vendor's by its ISA string. A regression in either gate fails exactly one file.
