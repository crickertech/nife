//! The T-Head TH1520, on the host, before a byte of ours runs on one.
//!
//! Prep for milestone 89 (Scaleway EM-RV1: a second RISC-V implementation, rented). The RV1 is
//! rented by the hour, so everything the device tree can settle is settled here for free.
//! `fixtures/th1520.dts` is hand-written from Linux's `th1520.dtsi` and says where each fact came
//! from. The facts it cannot hold (the firmware's own tree, the OpenSBI version, whether the SBI
//! reset extension exists) are the first rented hour's work, listed in the milestone.
