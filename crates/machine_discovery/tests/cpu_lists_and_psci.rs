//! **What the machine says its cores are, and how to start them.** Milestone 100, on the host.
//!
//! Four trees, and each is here because it is a shape the others cannot show:
//!
//! * **QEMU aarch64 `virt` at `-smp 4`**, dumped from the exact machine `script/test` boots
//!   (`virt,gic-version=2,iommu=smmuv3`, `cortex-a72`). This is the one that holds the kernel's
//!   former hardcodes against the machine: `hvc`, `0xc4000003`, and cores `0..4`.
//! * **QEMU aarch64 `virt` with `virtualization=on`**, which is the *only* configuration on this
//!   laptop that produces `method = "smc"`. It is a real dump, not a hand-edit, and it is the whole
//!   evidence that the conduit is a machine property rather than a constant.
//! * **QEMU riscv64 `virt`**, borrowed from the `device_tree_blob` crate's fixtures, for the
//!   `timebase-frequency` the RISC-V timer used to hardcode.
//! * **A hand-written clustered tree**, for the shapes QEMU cannot emit: two address cells, a
//!   non-contiguous hardware id, a disabled core, a spin-table core, more cores than the kernel's
//!   ceiling, and PSCI 0.1 with its own published function id.
//!
//! The parsing they exercise is [`machine_discovery::cpu_list`] and [`machine_discovery::aarch64::Psci`]; what happens on the
//! machine (the refusals, the boot line, the bring-up itself) is in the kernel's own tests, which
//! need an emulator. This is the split DECISIONS §7 asks for.
