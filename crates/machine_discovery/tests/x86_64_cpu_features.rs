//! Deciding what a `CPUID` answer means, on the host, including the answers that refuse the boot.
//!
//! **This file exists because the refusal path is unreachable on every machine this project can
//! run on.** Every `x86_64` part made since about 2004 has NX and `syscall`, and every QEMU model
//! reports both, so a boot gate written against those bits is a branch that has never been taken.
//! A gate that has never refused is a gate nobody has tested. Here the feature words are an
//! argument, so the part that does not exist can be handed to the decision and the refusal can be
//! watched happening.
//!
//! (The refusal *has* since been watched happening on a real boot too, by hiding NX from the guest
//! with `NIFE_CPU=max,nx=off`. That is the stronger test and it is recorded in
//! `design/roadmap/524-the-three-x86-64-boot-gates.md`. It is not a substitute for this file: QEMU
//! can hide a feature, but only from a whole boot, so each case costs a minute of emulator and
//! cannot assert on the decision in isolation.)
//!
//! There is no fixture file, for the same reason `aarch64_id_registers.rs` beside it has none: a
//! `CPUID` leaf *is* the fixture, four 32-bit words.
