//! The JH7110's disabled monitor core, on the host, before the board ever runs a byte of ours.
//!
//! The VisionFive 2 prep (notes/visionfive2.md). `fixtures/jh7110.dts` is hand-written, modeled on
//! the mainline `jh7110.dtsi` the note cites, and this file holds the `status = "disabled"` half
//! of what it witnesses: the S7 monitor core's ISA and MMU must not narrow the machine record, and
//! the roster must still know the hart exists and may not be started. The same fixture's PLIC
//! context layout is tested in `riscv64_plic_contexts.rs`.
