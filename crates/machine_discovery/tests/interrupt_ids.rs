//! The console UART's interrupt line, read from each machine's own tree, on the host.
//!
//! The number this replaces was the last QEMU constant on the interrupt path: `UART_IRQ = 10` in
//! `kernel/src/main.rs`, which on the JH7110 armed an unrelated PLIC source, and boot 13
//! (2026-08-15) proved it on silicon when a key press at the completed tour's prompt reached
//! nothing (notes/visionfive2.md, BUGS). These tests hold the fix's whole claim: the same read
//! that answers 10 on QEMU's tree answers 32 on both JH7110 fixtures, and 33 on the aarch64
//! `virt` tree whose GIC speaks three-cell entries, so the number the kernel arms is the
//! machine's rather than the emulator's.
//!
//! The three trees deliberately cover the three places `interrupt-parent` lives: on the serial
//! node itself (QEMU riscv64), once on the root (QEMU aarch64), and on `/soc` per the mainline
//! dtsi (the JH7110 upstream model; the vendor fixture spells it per-node).
