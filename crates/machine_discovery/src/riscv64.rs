//! **What RISC-V machine is this?** Parsed out of the device tree, because there is no CPUID.
//!
//! `misa` exists and is not enough: it is permitted to read as zero, its single-letter fields cannot
//! name a multi-letter extension, and every extension ratified after 2015 is multi-letter. So the
//! architected answer is a property firmware wrote into the device tree, and this module reads it.
//!
//! Three properties carry the answer, and which of them a given machine has depends on how old its
//! firmware is:
//!
//! | Property | Since | Shape |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `riscv,isa-extensions` | Linux 6.6 (2023) | a stringlist, one entry per extension |
//! | `riscv,isa-base` | Linux 6.6 (2023) | `"rv64i"` |
//! | `riscv,isa` | forever, deprecated | one string, `"rv64imafdc_zicsr_..."` |
//!
//! **The legacy string is not a fallback we are being polite about.** The VisionFive 2's vendor tree
//! predates the split, and it is the board this milestone exists for, so [`Isa::from_device_tree`]
//! parses both forms and records which one it got in [`Isa::legacy_isa_string`].
//!
//! # Why every CPU node, and not `cpu@0`
//!
//! A RISC-V machine may be heterogeneous, and the one arriving in August is: the JH7110 on a
//! VisionFive 2 pairs four U74 application cores with a small S7 monitor core, described as separate
//! `cpu@` nodes with **different `riscv,isa` strings**. A kernel that reads the first node and then
//! schedules a thread onto any hart has read the wrong node half the time.
//!
//! So [`Isa::common`] is the **intersection** over every CPU node that describes itself, which is
//! what "an instruction the kernel may emit" actually means, and [`Isa::any`] is the union, which is
//! the only way to tell "this machine has no FPU" from "one of its harts has no FPU". The `mmu-type`
//! is taken the same way: the narrowest any hart declares.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A `status = "disabled"` CPU node contributes nothing to the record** (the VisionFive 2 prep,
//!   2026-08-14; this used to be the first bug on this list). The real board showed the case this
//!   list was waiting for: the JH7110's hart 0 is an MMU-less S7 monitor core marked disabled, and
//!   counting it would narrow `common` to the S7's `rv64imac` and, on a tree that spells the S7's
//!   MMU as `riscv,none`, refuse to boot a machine whose four real harts are exactly our contract.
//!   The kernel never runs on a disabled hart (`smp` refuses to start one), so its self-description
//!   is not a fact about the machine the kernel schedules on. Such a node still counts in
//!   [`Isa::harts`], which is an honest node count, not a roster.
//! - **A hart whose own `riscv,isa` disclaims supervisor mode contributes nothing either** (the
//!   VisionFive 2 bench, 2026-08-14, same day, second stop). The vendor tree in the flashed
//!   firmware marks the S7 `status = "okay"` **and** gives it `mmu-type = "riscv,sv39"`, both
//!   false, so the `status` gate above never fires there. The one truthful property is the ISA
//!   string itself: `rv64imacu` spells user mode and omits supervisor. A hart that cannot enter
//!   S-mode never runs this kernel, so it may not narrow `common` or `mmu` regardless of what
//!   `status` claims. See [`supervisor_mode_claim`] for why the rule needs the `u` witness: absence
//!   of `s` alone would exclude every modern machine, QEMU included.
//! - **Absence of `zicsr` or `zifencei` from a legacy `riscv,isa` string is not evidence of
//!   absence.** Both were carved out of the base `I` extension in 2019, and a string written before
//!   that (or by firmware that never caught up) simply says `rv64imafdc` while the hardware has
//!   them. This is exactly why neither is in [`REQUIRED`] even though the kernel uses both on every
//!   trap and in `sync_icache`: a check that fails on the board we are buying is worse than no
//!   check. `M`, `A` and `C` carry no such ambiguity, so they are the ones that gate the boot.
