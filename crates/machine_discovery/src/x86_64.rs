//! **What the machine told us on the way in, `x86_64`**: the PVH `hvm_start_info` structure, and
//! what the CPU says about itself when asked.
//!
//! Milestone 161 (the `x86_64` kernel port). The handoff half is the third answer to the question
//! the other two modules in this crate answer, and it is a *fourth* tier the crate's header does
//! not list, because x86 has all three of the others and needs a different one for this fact.
//!
//! The [`Isa`] half at the bottom of this file is the ordinary third answer, added by
//! milestone 524 (the three `x86_64` boot gates). It arrived late for a reason worth stating,
//! because the reason was wrong: asking x86 what it is takes one instruction, so there is no
//! format to parse, so it looked like there was nothing here for a host test to hold. **Reading the
//! answer is trivial and deciding what it means is not**, because `CPUID` has no way to say "I do
//! not implement that leaf" other than answering with a different leaf's bits, and the rule for
//! telling those apart is the thing that can be wrong.
//!
//! The other two architectures learn where RAM is from the device tree, which the firmware hands
//! them as a single pointer. x86 has no device tree. What it has is a boot protocol, and the
//! protocol this kernel uses (PVH, see `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/boot.s` for why not multiboot) hands
//! over one pointer to a structure carrying the memory map, the ACPI root pointer, the command line
//! and any loaded modules. So the *shape* is identical to the device-tree handoff, one pointer to
//! everything, and only the format differs.
//!
//! # Why the decoding is here and not in `arch/x86_64/`
//!
//! Because it is a parser, and a parser proved only inside a booting kernel is a parser proved by
//! nothing that runs in milliseconds. Same reason `crates/device_tree_blob` exists rather than a
//! device-tree reader living in `arch/aarch64/`: this file compiles for the host, its tests run
//! without an emulator, and the kernel side is reduced to reading a pointer through the direct map.
//!
//! # The structure, from Xen's `start_info.h`
//!
//! ```text
//! struct hvm_start_info {          offset  size
//!     uint32_t magic;                   0     4   0x336ec578, "xEn3" little-endian
//!     uint32_t version;                 4     4
//!     uint32_t flags;                   8     4
//!     uint32_t nr_modules;             12     4
//!     uint64_t modlist_paddr;          16     8
//!     uint64_t cmdline_paddr;          24     8
//!     uint64_t rsdp_paddr;             32     8   the ACPI root pointer
//!     /* version >= 1 only: */
//!     uint64_t memmap_paddr;           40     8
//!     uint32_t memmap_entries;         48     4
//!     uint32_t reserved;               52     4
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! Version 0 stops at offset 40, which is why [`BootInfo::parse`] reads the memory-map fields only
//! when the version says they are there and reports zero entries otherwise. A caller that finds no
//! entries has to fall back to the legacy E820 call, which this kernel cannot make (it needs real
//! mode), so in practice a version-0 handoff means "this kernel cannot find its RAM here"; the
//! caller decides what to do about it and this module only reports what is true.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Nothing checks that the map is sorted or non-overlapping.** The specification does not
//!   promise either, and every implementation this has been run against produces a sorted map. A
//!   frame allocator built over an unsorted or overlapping map would double-count, so the consumer
//!   is where that check belongs.
