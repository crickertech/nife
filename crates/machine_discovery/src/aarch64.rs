//! **What aarch64 machine is this?** Decoded from the ID registers, because the CPU says so itself.
//!
//! This half of the crate is deliberately much shorter than [`riscv64`](crate::riscv64), and the
//! asymmetry is the finding rather than a gap. ARM never removed the CPU's self-description:
//! `MIDR_EL1` names the part, and the `ID_AA64*` space is architected, mandatory, and readable at
//! EL1, so the answer comes from the silicon in front of you with no firmware in the path. There is
//! nothing here to parse and nothing to disbelieve.
//!
//! So the aarch64 record is a **decoder**, not a parser: the kernel reads three registers and hands
//! the raw words here, and everything below is shifts, masks and the ARM ARM's encodings.
//!
//! # Except for one thing the silicon cannot tell you, which is [`Psci`]
//!
//! Milestone 100 added the one aarch64 fact that is *not* in an ID register, and could not be:
//! whether a firmware call leaves the kernel at `hvc` or at `smc` depends on what is running above
//! EL1, which is a property of the boot arrangement rather than of the part. So [`Psci`] is a
//! parser, like the whole RISC-V half, and it reads `/psci`.
//!
//! # What the kernel already did, and what changed
//!
//! One field was read before this milestone: `TCR_EL1.IPS` is written from
//! `ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1.PARange`, with a comment saying "read it from the hardware rather than
//! guessing; a value larger than the implementation supports is UNPREDICTABLE". That was the whole
//! of ISA discovery on this ISA, and it was right. This module gives it a record to live in and
//! three neighbours that were being assumed:
//!
//! * the **4 KiB granule**, which the page tables are built on and which `TGran4` may refuse,
//! * the **ASID width**, which `crates/asid` is built on and which RISC-V had to measure,
//! * the **VA range**, the direct twin of RISC-V's `mmu-type`.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **`VARange` reporting 52 does not mean the kernel could use 52.** ARMv8.2-LVA needs a 64 KiB
//!   granule and ARMv8.7-LPA2 is a separate feature bit this record does not read. The field is
//!   reported because it is what the machine says; acting on it is a milestone, not a branch.
//! - **`TGran16`'s encoding is inverted relative to its siblings.** `TGran4` and `TGran64` spell
//!   "supported" as `0b0000` and "not supported" as `0b1111`; `TGran16` spells them `0b0001` and
//!   `0b0000`. A decoder that treats the three uniformly reports 16 KiB backwards on every part in
//!   existence, which is why each has its own line below.
