//! **ACPI: what x86 has instead of a device tree.**
//!
//! Milestone 161. This module sits beside the arch records rather than inside the `x86_64` one, for
//! the reason [`cpu_list`](crate::cpu_list) does: ACPI is not an x86 standard. Every aarch64 server
//! that is not a device-tree board describes itself with exactly these tables, and milestone 20's
//! own roadmap text says the machine after the VisionFive 2 "should probably be a UEFI/ACPI machine
//! rather than another Device Tree board". x86 is simply its first consumer here.
//!
//! # The shape, and how it differs from a device tree
//!
//! A device tree is one blob with one root and a tree of nodes, and `crates/device_tree_blob` walks
//! it. ACPI is a **linked structure of independent tables**, each with its own signature and
//! checksum, reached from a root pointer that is not itself a table:
//!
//! ```text
//!   RSDP  ("RSD PTR ")            found by scanning low memory, or handed over by the loader
//!    |
//!    +-- RSDT (32-bit pointers)   ACPI 1.0
//!    +-- XSDT (64-bit pointers)   ACPI 2.0+, and what to prefer when both exist
//!         |
//!         +-- APIC ("MADT")       the local APICs, the IO APICs, and the interrupt rewiring
//!         +-- MCFG                where the PCIe ECAM window is
//!         +-- DMAR                where the IOMMU is
//!         +-- FACP, HPET, WAET, ...
//! ```
//!
//! **Every table is checksummed and this module checks**, which a device tree has no equivalent of.
//! That is not politeness: the RSDP is found by *scanning memory for a string*, so without the
//! checksum any sixteen bytes that happen to spell `RSD PTR ` would be believed.
//!
//! # What is here and what is deliberately not
//!
//! Here: the RSDP, the root table walk, the SDT header, and the two tables the kernel needs first
//! (MADT and MCFG). Not here, and it is the big one: **AML**, the bytecode in the DSDT that
//! describes everything ACPI does not have a fixed table for, including PCI interrupt routing
//! (`_PRT`) and every power-management method. AML needs an interpreter, which is a project rather
//! than a parser, and nothing in this kernel needs it yet.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Nothing validates that two tables do not overlap**, or that a table's length is sane
//!   relative to where it sits in memory. The caller supplies the bytes, so the caller is where a
//!   physical-address sanity check belongs.
//! - **The MADT's `flags` bit 0 (`PCAT_COMPAT`) is reported and not acted on.** It means the machine
//!   also has 8259 PICs that must be masked before the APICs are used. Whoever brings the APIC up
//!   has to mask them; this only says whether they are there.
//! - **A DRHD's PCI device scopes are decoded into fixed arrays** ([`DmarUnits`], milestone 261 (the NVMe driver leaves the kernel)'s
//!   bench rehearsal) and anything past them sets [`DmarUnits::truncated`], which turns an
//!   ownership question into "unknown" rather than a guess. IOAPIC, HPET and ACPI-namespace scopes
//!   are skipped, and RMRR, ATSR and the rest are not decoded at all: nothing here maps an RMRR,
//!   so a device firmware expects to keep DMA-ing into one (USB legacy emulation, the integrated
//!   GPU's stolen memory) faults once its unit translates. [`first_drhd`] is kept for its callers
//!   and is no longer the unit the kernel brings up.
//! - **`Dmar::flags`' `INTR_REMAP` bit is read and never used.** Interrupt remapping is a real VT-d
//!   feature this parser can report the presence of and this kernel does not build.
//! - **An MCFG window whose `end_bus` precedes its `start_bus` is reported as written.** Nothing in
//!   the encoding forbids it and [`mcfg_entry`] does not refuse it, because the bus numbers are the
//!   firmware's claim and this module reports claims. [`McfgEntry::size`] answers zero for such a
//!   window, which is what "no bus is in this range" means; a caller that reads `start_bus` and
//!   `end_bus` itself, as the boot print does, sees the inverted pair.
