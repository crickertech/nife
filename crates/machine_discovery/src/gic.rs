//! **Which Arm interrupt controller is this, and does the hardware agree?** The GIC's device tree
//! node, read by its binding, and a cross-check of what the silicon says about itself.
//!
//! Milestone 227 (design/roadmap/227-gicv3-driver.md). Until this existed the kernel found its GIC
//! by the node-name prefix `intc@` and took the first two `reg` blocks as "distributor, CPU
//! interface". That is true of a GICv2 and false of a GICv3, whose second block is the
//! **redistributor** array. Milestone 222 measured what followed: a kernel that booted the whole
//! tour, brought four cores up, printed `interrupts ON`, and then took zero interrupts with nothing
//! faulting, because GICv2 CPU-interface writes landed in a redistributor frame and did nothing.
//!
//! So this module answers two questions, and the second is the one that makes the first safe:
//!
//! 1. [`discover`]: **what the firmware claims.** The node is found by `compatible`, never by its
//!    label, and the version is read from which binding matched. A node the old prefix would have
//!    matched but whose binding this kernel does not drive is a [`Refusal`], not a guess.
//! 2. [`Gic::confirm`]: **what the hardware says.** The architecture revision the controller
//!    reports about itself, read by the kernel and handed over as a raw word (this crate reads no
//!    registers, the same split as [`crate::aarch64::Isa::decode`]): `GICD_PIDR2.ArchRev` for a
//!    GICv3, `GICC_IIDR.ArchitectureVersion` for a GICv2, the latter read from the very block the
//!    tree calls the CPU interface. A tree that says one version while the hardware is another
//!    fails here, loudly, at boot, which is the whole point: the failure milestone 222 measured is
//!    impossible to reach silently once this runs.
//!
//! # Why `ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.GIC` is not one of the facts
//!
//! It was, in this module's first draft, and **the machine overruled it** (2026-09-19, the first
//! HVF boot): QEMU under Hypervisor.framework on an Apple core reports `ID_AA64PFR0_EL1` as
//! `0x1101000010110011`, whose `GIC` field (bits 27:24) is **zero**, while QEMU emulates the GICv3
//! system registers perfectly well behind it. The field describes the physical core, which has
//! Apple's AIC rather than a GIC, and the hypervisor does not rewrite it. Linux does not require it
//! either: its GICv3 driver sets `ICC_SRE_EL1.SRE` and reads it back, which is a measurement rather
//! than a claim, and the kernel's CPU-interface bring-up does exactly that and panics if the bit
//! will not stick. On a core that truly has no interface the first `ICC_*` access is UNDEFINED and
//! traps, which is loud too. The field is still the right guard where Linux uses it, at EL2
//! (`boot.s`), because there the question is whether the registers exist to be touched at all.
//!
//! # The two bindings, as QEMU 11.1.1 writes them (`dumpdtb`, both versions of `virt`)
//!
//! | | `gic-version=2` | `gic-version=3` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `compatible` | `arm,cortex-a15-gic` | `arm,gic-v3` |
//! | `reg[0]` | GICD, `0x8000000 + 0x10000` | GICD, `0x8000000 + 0x10000` |
//! | `reg[1]` | GICC, `0x8010000 + 0x10000` | GICR, `0x80a0000 + 0xf60000` |
//! | MSI child | `v2m@8020000` | `its@8080000` under TCG, **`v2m@8020000` under HVF** |
//!
//! The fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` are those dumps, round-tripped through `dtc`.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **One redistributor region.** The binding allows several (`#redistributor-regions`), for
//!   machines whose redistributor frames are not contiguous; QEMU `virt` needs a second only past
//!   123 cores, and this kernel's `cpu::MAX_CPUS` is eight. A tree stating more than one is a
//!   [`Refusal::SeveralRedistributorRegions`] rather than a partial answer, so the day a board
//!   needs it the boot says so instead of losing the cores in the second region.
//! - **The GICv2 binding list is the three strings an aarch64 GICv2 actually carries**
//!   (`arm,gic-400`, `arm,cortex-a15-gic`, `arm,cortex-a7-gic`), checked against Linux's
//!   `drivers/irqchip/irq-gic.c` `IRQCHIP_DECLARE` table at v6.16. The older version-1 parts that
//!   table also lists (`arm,cortex-a9-gic`, `arm,pl390`, the 11MPCore family) exist only on 32-bit
//!   machines this kernel cannot boot, so they are left out rather than claimed.
//! - **The ITS is not read.** A GICv3's MSI translation service is a child node and a separate
//!   device; milestone 317 records why interrupt remapping wants it and nothing drives it yet.
//! - **This is aarch64's question.** On RISC-V a node named `interrupt-controller@...` is the PLIC
//!   and a child of every `cpu@` node is a `riscv,cpu-intc`; the kernel asks this only on aarch64.
//!
//! Name: provisional (`gic` for the module, `Gic` for the record, `Refusal` and `Mismatch` for the
//! two ways it says no), named for the controller whose binding it reads, the same pattern as
//! [`crate::plic`].
