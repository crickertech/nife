//! Parse partition tables written by other people's tools.
//!
//! A parser that only round-trips its own output proves almost nothing: every mistake it makes on
//! the way in it makes symmetrically on the way out, and the test still passes. So these run
//! against **bytes this crate did not produce**, from two implementations that share no code:
//!
//! - `sgdisk` 1.0.10 (gptfdisk), the Linux-world tool, C++;
//! - macOS `diskutil` / `hdiutil`, Apple's, closed source.
//!
//! Both write a GPT that this crate must accept exactly as it is, or the crate is wrong. They
//! disagree on three things (partition names, CHS fields, and which type GUIDs they use), and the
//! disagreements are as valuable as the agreements: each one is a place where a check written from
//! only one tool's output would have been too strict.
//!
//! # Regenerating the fixtures
//!
//! Each is the **first 34 and last 33 blocks** of a 64 MiB, 512-byte-block disk image: the whole
//! primary table and the whole backup table, with the 64 MiB of nothing in between left out.
