//! A partition entry: 128 bytes saying what a partition is, where it starts, and where it stops.
//!
//! # Decoding an entry cannot fail
//!
//! [`Entry::decode`] is **total**: every one of the 2^1024 bit patterns is a valid `Entry` value,
//! and the round trip back through [`Entry::encode`] returns the bytes it started with. That is a
//! deliberate layering, the same one `network_time_protocol` makes: decoding judges nothing, so it
//! needs no error type, and every rule about whether an entry makes *sense* on a particular disk
//! lives in [`crate::GloballyUniqueIdentifierPartitionTable`] where the disk's geometry is known.
//!
//! # The name is UTF-16, and the name is optional
//!
//! 36 UTF-16LE code units, null-padded, and it is a label for humans. Nothing in the format depends
//! on it and nothing should: partitions are found by type GUID or unique GUID.
//!
//! Worth knowing before writing code that relies on names: **macOS does not write them.** Partition
//! a disk image with `diskutil partitionDisk ... HFS+ MACDATA`, give the volume a name, and the GPT
//! entry's 72 name bytes are still all zero, because on a Mac the volume name lives in the
//! filesystem. The committed Apple fixture pins that behaviour. `sgdisk`, `parted` and Linux tools
//! do write it. So a partition browser that keys off the GPT name shows blanks on half the disks in
//! the world, and that is not a bug in the browser.
