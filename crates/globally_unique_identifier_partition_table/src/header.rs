//! The GPT header: 92 bytes at LBA 1, and the same 92 bytes again at the last LBA.
//!
//! Everything about where the table lives is in here, which is why there are two copies. Lose the
//! header and the entry array is 16 KiB of unlabelled structs.
//!
//! # The layering this module commits to
//!
//! [`Header::decode`] answers **"are these bytes a GPT header?"** and nothing else: signature,
//! revision, header size, the reserved word, the CRC over the header's own bytes, and the reserved
//! tail of the block. It has no idea how big the disk is, where the partitions are, or whether it
//! is looking at the primary or the backup, so it cannot judge any of that.
//!
//! Every judgement that needs the *disk* is in [`crate::GloballyUniqueIdentifierPartitionTable`].
//! The split matters because the backup header has to be decodable on its own terms before anything
//! can compare it against the primary, and because it puts every geometry rule in one function
//! instead of scattering them.
