/// The attacker is given every advantage short of a capability. It is the *same binary* as the
/// honest client, with the same grants, and the kernel hands it the **exact virtual address** at
/// which its neighbour's pixels sit: one page past its own surface, which is where the kernel's
/// contiguous allocation really did put them (asserted here, so the attack cannot quietly become a
/// poke at nothing). Every client maps its surface at the same virtual address, so this is also the
/// address the neighbour uses for its own pixels. It still cannot touch them, because the boundary
/// is the mapping and not the layout.
///
/// What that proves, in order:
///
/// 1. **The refusal that needs no attack.** The attacker asks the kernel to receive on the input
///    slot it was not granted, and gets `NoSuchSlot`: "there is nothing there", not a permission
///    error from a server that consulted a list. Slot 2 is empty because the spawn literal left it
///    empty, and that emptiness is the whole of the difference between this client and a focusable
///    one.
/// 2. **The write faults**, and on aarch64 the faulting address is exactly the one it was handed.
/// 3. **Nothing was written**: the victim's witness pattern digests identically before and after,
///    from two independent readers (the kernel through the direct map, and the victim itself
///    through its own mapping after the attacker is dead). The victim is held in a `CALL` across
///    the whole attack so that "after" really is after.
/// 4. **No ambient display.** A third client, which painted into this very screen, reads the
///    address where the screen is mapped in the compositor and in the capture client, and faults.
///    It holds no mapping of the screen, so there is nothing to read and no verb to ask with.
///
/// A read fault proves the page is not mapped *at all*, which is the same reason a write cannot
/// reach it either; the two probes here are a write (integrity) and a read (confidentiality) so
/// both directions are exercised on real hardware behaviour rather than argued from one.

/// Two display terminals, side by side, each a compositor client with exactly a window client's
/// authority. The keystroke routing this rung already proved is now **visible in the picture**,
/// which is a stronger statement than the endpoint-level one and a different kind of evidence:
/// an `A` typed while terminal 0 has focus appears in terminal 0's grid, a TAB moves focus, and
/// a `B` appears in terminal 1's. Neither letter appears in the other window, and the kernel
/// checks that by comparing every pixel of the composed screen against the two engines it ran
/// itself.
///
/// # Why this is the capability claim and not a policy claim
///
/// Terminal 1 receives the `B` because it **holds an input endpoint**, not because it asked and
/// not because the compositor consulted a list (DECISIONS §33). The compositor's whole part in
/// it is choosing *which* of the capabilities it holds to use. A client granted no input endpoint
/// has an empty capability table slot and cannot be sent a keystroke by anyone, which the neighbouring test
/// in this module proves by value (`NoSuchSlot`); this one proves the other half, that a
/// keystroke routed to one holder does not land in another's memory.
///
/// # And the terminal is a client, unchanged at both seams
///
/// `compositor` cannot tell a display terminal from the `window` client that paints a coordinate
/// pattern: same grants, same control page, same doorbell, same `COMMIT`. Neither `compositor` nor
/// `graphics_proto` needed a line changed to carry text. That is the seam claim made twice in one
/// milestone, once at each rung.
///
/// Uses the kernel's display stand-in rather than the GPU, deliberately: this test is about
/// routing and composition, the device is proved elsewhere in this file, and a third `display`
/// against the same physical device would put the scanout's picture in a race with the
/// host-side check that reads it.

///    against `compositor::expected_screen_pixel`, a value it computed itself;
/// 3. **a capture client in its own address space**, which holds a read-only mapping of the screen
///    (that mapping being the screenshot capability) and digests what it sees;
