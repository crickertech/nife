/// This is the whole of calef's 2026-09-21 ruling that a thread observing itself reads a page,
/// proved end to end: `crates/current_cpu_protocol` lays the page out, `AddressSpace::new` maps it
/// read-only, `schedule()` writes the core at switch-in, and `user_mode_runtime::current_cpu`
/// reads it. (The ruling's `design/decisions/` section is on another branch and is named here
/// rather than cited.)
///
/// **What it asserts is membership in the online set, not a particular number**, and that is the
/// assertion worth having rather than the one that looks stronger. A test that pinned the answer
/// to `0` would pass on QEMU `virt` forever and say nothing, because the scheduler is free to put
/// the thread anywhere. A test that the id names a core which is actually online is the one that
/// catches the failure this tree has already paid for: the VisionFive 2's set is `{1, 2, 3}`, and
/// treating a count as an index put `init` into a parked core's inbox and cost three boots
/// (`crates/cpu_set`). A userspace consumer indexing an array by this value inherits that hazard,
/// so the value had better be a real id.
///
/// **And that neither read is `None`**, which is the other half: a thread cannot execute an
/// instruction without having been switched in first, so by the time this program runs its page has
/// been written, and a `None` here means the page never got mapped or never got written.
