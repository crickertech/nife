/// **A command is timed by the shell's clock, and the command is handed nothing.**

/// This is the milestone's whole claim, and the three assertions are what make it one rather than a
/// slogan:
///
/// - **The same command, timed and untimed, answers the same thing.** `worker 3` is run twice in the
///   script, once bare and once behind `time`, and both must report `3*3 = 9`. A prefix word that
///   re-tokenized its tail, dropped an option or spawned something else would fail here, and nothing
///   about the printed duration would have told anybody.
/// - **The duration is positive and sane.** A real spawn (an address space, an ELF copy, a thread, a
///   rendezvous and a reply) cannot take zero time, so a zero here means the two readings came from
///   the same instant, which is what a `time` that read its clock once would print. The upper bound
///   is loose on purpose: TCG under load is slow and a tight bound would be a flake, while a
///   nanoseconds-for-microseconds error misses a ten-second ceiling by four orders of magnitude.
/// - **`worker` holds no clock.** Its manifest declares none, so init endows none, and it is still
///   timed. That is the sentence the milestone exists for: measuring a thing needs the observer's
///   authority, not the subject's.
///
/// And the builtin, which is the other end of the same claim: `time echo hello` spawns **no process
/// at all** and still reports a duration, because what is being measured is an interval and not a
/// process.

/// counter, which the kernel opened to EL0, so the offset a clock page carries cancels and `time`
/// can always measure. The refusal was not protecting anyone; it was a capability check that
/// gated nothing.
