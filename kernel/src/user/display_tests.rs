/// The pattern is a per-coordinate function ([`graphics_proto::pixel`]), not a fill, and the digest is
/// position sensitive, so a blank, stale, shifted, transposed, or truncated surface cannot pass
/// (`crates/graphics_proto`'s host tests assert exactly those properties of the pattern itself). Two
/// independent witnesses report it, from two different address spaces: the **client** digests the
/// surface after the flush through its own mapping, and the **driver** digests it through a
/// different mapping after the device reported the transfer complete. The kernel compares both
/// against a value it computed itself from the contract, so neither process is grading its own
/// homework.
///
/// It also proves the device could reach those exact frames and no others: the surface lives
/// inside the driver's registered DMA region, the IOMMU domain maps exactly that region, and
/// `RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING` naming it succeeded, which under translation only happens if the
/// address translated.
///
/// # What this test does NOT prove, and what does
///
/// **This test proves the framebuffer, not the scanout.** The suite runs `-display none`, and
/// nothing inside the guest can read back QEMU's host-side surface, so "the bytes we handed the
/// device are the bytes it read out of our frames" is as far as an *in-guest* test reaches. A
/// wrong pixel *format* or a wrong scanout rectangle would pass this while showing garbage on a
/// real screen.
///
/// The scanout is proven **from the host instead**, because only the host can see it:
/// `cargo xtask`'s scanout check drives QEMU's monitor beside this suite, dumps the scanout with
/// `screendump` (which works headlessly), and compares the PPM against `graphics_proto::pixel` pixel
/// for pixel, on both ISAs. Together the two halves cover the whole path. See
/// notes/framebuffer-contract.md, "Proving the scanout, from the host".

/// pass every run including the ones that drew the wrong thing.
///
/// # What the script exercises, and why each part is there
///
/// Four rows of text (a one-row picture would hide a stride error), three renditions (a terminal
/// that ignored SGR would draw every glyph correctly and still fail), a `\r\n` pair (what
/// `line_editor::expand_output` puts on the wire for a Unix `\n`), descenders and an underscore (the
/// glyph rows a font table truncated to seven would lose), and then **keystrokes**, delivered as
/// `OP_BYTES`: the terminal contract's driver half, byte for byte what `user/src/input.rs` sends
/// and what the compositor forwards to a focused client.
///
/// # And the picture the driver reports is the *blank* terminal, on purpose
///
/// `display`'s one status report covers its first flush, which here is the terminal's blank grid
/// before anything has been written. So it doubles as the check that an empty terminal is a
