/// **A userspace program reads the same counter frequency the kernel did**, on every architecture,
/// through whatever mechanism that architecture has.
///
/// This is the test the tree did not have, and its absence is what let `user_mode_runtime::cntfrq`
/// return a hardcoded `10_000_000` on riscv64 for two months. Under QEMU `virt` that constant is
/// the right answer, so every existing assertion (`freq > 0`, `ticks > 0`) passed and would have
/// gone on passing on radon, where the real rate is 4 MHz and every userspace duration was
/// therefore 2.5x too large. **A test that compares against a constant cannot catch a constant.**
/// So this compares against the kernel's own number, which comes from the machine: `CNTFRQ_EL0` on
/// aarch64, `/cpus/timebase-frequency` on riscv64, `CPUID` leaf `0x15` or PIT calibration on
/// `x86_64`. If any of the three ever hands userspace a different number than it uses itself, this
/// fails, and it fails on the emulator rather than on somebody's board.
///
/// **What the chain under test actually is**, which is why this uses `coremark` rather than a
/// smaller fixture. The kernel spawns `hello` directly (`spawn_hello`, which maps the timebase page
/// on the architectures that need one), and `hello`'s `init_coremark` role then builds `coremark` as
/// a child through `supervision_protocol::build_child_space`, the tree's one *userspace* ELF loader.
/// So the number this asserts on travelled kernel to `hello` to `coremark`: a generation of
/// propagation, not just a mapping. That second hop is the one that used to lose the number
/// entirely (the child got a zeroed placeholder page and `cntfrq` substituted 1 GHz on `x86_64`).
///
/// `coremark` is also the only program in the tree that reports its own `cntfrq` over IPC, which is
/// the other half of why it is the vehicle: nothing had to be added to a fixture to ask this
/// question.
