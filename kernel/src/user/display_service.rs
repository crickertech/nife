//! **The display seam's wiring**: a confined virtio-gpu driver, the client that paints through it,
//! and the terminal that took the client's place (milestones 29, 33; notes/framebuffer-contract.md).
//!
//! # The pixels are capabilities now (milestone 108, notes/frames.md)
//!
//! Everything here used to arrive as `Spawn::maps`: the kernel wrote the DMA region into the
//! driver's address space and the surface into the client's, at addresses the kernel picked, before
//! either program's first instruction. Nothing in either capability table said the memory was there, and
//! nothing could narrow it, hand it on, or take it back.
//!
//! Each program now holds its pages as `Frame` capabilities and maps them itself, out of an untyped
//! it also holds. **This is where the object shows its edge**, and the milestone's scope note asked
//! for exactly this finding: a `Frame` names *one page*, so the driver's nine-page DMA region is
//! nine capabilities in nine consecutive slots of a sixteen-slot capability table. It fits, with one slot
//! spare, and it would not fit a larger surface. The `const` assertion on `DRIVER_SLOT_DMA` is
//! there so that a scanout somebody widens fails the build rather than the boot.
//!
//! What stays wired at spawn is nothing at all here: these programs have no extra stack pages, so
//! the only page the kernel still places is the one `load` gives every process.
