//! **The display seam's wiring**: a confined virtio-gpu driver, the client that paints through it,
//! and the terminal that took the client's place (milestones 29, 33; notes/framebuffer-contract.md).
//!
//! # The pixels are capabilities now (milestone 108, notes/frames.md)
//!
//! Everything here used to arrive as `Spawn::maps`: the kernel wrote the DMA region into the
//! driver's address space and the surface into the client's, at addresses the kernel picked, before
//! either program's first instruction. Nothing in either capability table said the memory was there, and
//! nothing could narrow it, hand it on, or take it back.
//!
//! Each program now holds its pages as `PageFrame` capabilities and maps them itself, out of an untyped
//! it also holds.
//!
//! # One capability per run, not one per page (DECISIONS §102, milestone 142)
//!
//! `PageFrame` used to name exactly one page, so the driver's DMA region (rings and control
//! buffers, then the surface) was one capability per page: at the 128x64 scanout this milestone
//! grew from, that was 9 capabilities in 9 consecutive slots of a sixteen-slot capability table,
//! with one slot spare and no room for anything larger. §102 gave `PageFrame` a page count, so a
//! whole run is now **one capability and one `MAP` call**, however many pages it holds. That is
//! what makes the grown scanout ([`graphics_protocol::WIDTH`] x [`graphics_protocol::HEIGHT`],
//! [`graphics_protocol::SURFACE_PAGE_FRAMES`] page frames) fit at all: that many one-page capabilities
//! never would have, whether the surface is the 900-frame 1280x720 this milestone first grew to or
//! the 311-frame 924x344 it was retargeted to on 2026-08-27. See notes/frames.md.
//!
//! What stays wired at spawn is nothing at all here: these programs have no extra stack pages, so
//! the only page the kernel still places is the one `load` gives every process.
