//! **The raw-keystroke primitive** (milestone 169): `OP_RAWMODE` and `OP_READRAW`, proved against
//! a real `line_editor` process the way this tree proves everything, with a client that asks for
//! raw mode, sends real keystrokes, and gets them back unbuffered.
//!
//! `raw_mode_service::start` plays both the input driver and the application on one `TERM`
//! endpoint (the contract already allows this: DECISIONS §21's endpoint-only naming means nobody
//! on the other end can tell who is calling) and a fake console that never reads its own shared
//! page, so a test can sentinel-fill that page and check it untouched: the same witness-page
//! discipline `c_seam`'s confiner tests use, applied to "nothing was echoed" instead of "nothing
//! outside a grant changed".
