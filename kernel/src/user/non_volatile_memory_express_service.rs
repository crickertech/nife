//! **Wiring for the EL0 NVMe block server** (milestone 261; [DECISIONS §86]'s option 2a,
//! DECIDED 2026-09-03; notes/non-volatile-memory-express.md).
//!
//! [DECISIONS §86]: ../../../design/decisions/86-el0-nvme-driver.md
//!
//! The kernel half of a split the hardware already draws. `kernel/src/non_volatile_memory_express.rs` resets the
//! controller, builds the admin queues by register, IDENTIFYs the namespace and creates the one
//! I/O queue pair; this file decides what the process that drives that queue pair is handed, and
//! the whole of the confinement claim is in the [`Spawn`] literal below.
//!
//! # What the server holds, and what it is denied
//!
//! Held, and it is four mappings and two endpoints:
//!
//! - slot 0, the **request** endpoint (RECV): clients `CALL` here, `filesystem_protocol::blk`'s
//!   wire format, the same one the virtio block server speaks;
//! - slot 1, a **readiness** endpoint (WRITE): exactly one message once the first command has
//!   round-tripped, so a hang in bring-up is distinguishable from a hang in the first read;
//! - mapped: **one page of BAR0**, device-typed, the **doorbell page** at `bar0 + 0x1000`;
//! - mapped: **the data plane's run of its DMA region**, normal memory, read/write: the I/O
//!   submission ring, the I/O completion ring, and [`crate::non_volatile_memory_express::TRANSFER_PAGES`] pages of transfer
//!   buffer.
//!
//! Denied, and each of these is a decision rather than an omission:
//!
//! - **BAR0's controller register page** (offsets 0x000..0x1000: `CC`, `CSTS`, `AQA`, `ASQ`,
//!   `ACQ`). A process that cannot name that page cannot reset the controller and cannot move a
//!   ring. This is the split, and it is a page boundary because NVMe 1.4 §3.1 put one there.
//! - **The admin plane's pages of the DMA region** (the two admin rings and the IDENTIFY buffer).
//!   The kernel allocated the region and mints every mapping into it, so which pages the server
//!   can address is entirely in the kernel's gift.
//! - **An `Irq` capability.** The server polls the completion ring's phase tag. That is one fewer
//!   authority than `components/src/entropy.rs` holds, and it is also what the NVMe controller is
//!   created for: `Command::create_io_cq` sets `IEN=0` and names no vector, so there is no
//!   interrupt to grant. The cost is recorded in this module's `BUGS`.
//! - **A `Virtio` capability**, because this is not a virtio device and there is no kernel-
//!   mediated transport to hold.
//! - **A `DeviceFrame` or `PageFrame` capability.** The pages arrive as [`Mapping`]s installed
//!   before `_start` runs, so the server holds no *name* for either window and cannot delegate,
//!   remap or revoke them. Milestone 159's TRNG driver made the same choice for the same reason,
//!   and its own header records that an earlier draft's `DeviceFrame` slot described a thing
//!   nobody hands over.
//! - **The physical address of anything but its own data plane.** [`non_volatile_memory_express::Handoff`] carries one
//!   base, and it is page [`crate::non_volatile_memory_express::DATA_PLANE_PAGE`] of the region, not page 0.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **A driver confined to a region can still aim DMA anywhere inside that region, its own admin
//! rings included.** The IOMMU keys on the controller's requester id and bounds it to the whole
//! allocation, because the controller fetches admin commands out of it; so a server that computes
//! a PRP pointing back at page 0 can make the controller overwrite the admin submission ring. It
//! cannot reach a byte outside the region, so this is a denial of service against the controller
//! and not an escape, and §86's option 2a states it in exactly those terms. **Option 4's
//! doorbell validator is what would close it**, and §86 records in advance what measurement would
//! buy that; this milestone is not that measurement.
//!
//! **The doorbell page carries the admin doorbells too, when `CAP.DSTRD` is 0.** `SQ0TDBL` is at
//! `0x1000` and `CQ0HDBL` at `0x1004`, so the server can ring the admin queue. It cannot *write*
//! the admin submission ring (that page is not mapped), so the worst it can do is make the
//! controller re-fetch slots the kernel wrote or never filled. Same class as the entry above:
//! denial of service against the controller, not an escape. A controller reporting a nonzero
//! stride would put the admin doorbells on their own page and this would not arise; QEMU reports
//! 0, which §86 notes is also "the expected doorbell stride value" for hardware.
//!
//! **The server cannot read `CSTS`, so a hung controller presents as a timeout rather than as
//! `CSTS.CFS`.** The kernel's admin plane short-circuits on the fatal-error bit; the EL0 data
//! plane polls a bounded loop and answers `EIO`. That is a worse diagnostic for a real failure
//! and it is the direct price of not mapping the controller register page, which is the trade
//! this milestone exists to make.
//!
//! **One command in flight, so the ring depth buys nothing.** Inherited from the kernel-resident
//! driver this replaced (notes/non-volatile-memory-express.md's `BUGS`), and it is what makes any throughput number
//! measured against this server a lower bound rather than the device's.
//!
//! Name: recorded (crates/non_volatile_memory_express). Renamed 2026-09-18 under DECISIONS §154
//! (the acronym test is whether the phrase is spoken), for milestone 261 (the NVMe driver leaves
//! the kernel). This
//! module is a `<program>_service` like `entropy_service`, `clock_service` and `virtio_service`,
//! so its name is the program's plus the suffix and carries no decision of its own. It was
//! `nvme_service` while the program was `nvme_server`; the ruling and the refusals live once,
//! beside the crate, in `crates/non_volatile_memory_express`.
