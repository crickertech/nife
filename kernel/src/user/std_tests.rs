/// Six steps, each of which has to happen for the next one to mean anything:
///
/// 1. a block server brings up the crash test's own disk (nothing else in the boot touches it);
/// 2. an FS server mounts it, so the image was sound before this test damaged it;

///    traps with the transaction's commit unwritten. The `CUT` word is how we know the kill was

/// 5. a **different FS-server process** mounts the same disk through the same block server. Its
///    readiness sentinel is the consistency result: `Server::open` refuses an image it cannot
///    make sense of, so arriving at all means the filesystem is intact;
/// 6. a fresh client reads the file and says which payload is in it.

/// A whole Rust `std` program runs on the native ABI and its output is exactly right.

/// Granted a heap, a stdout endpoint, and a clock, so both `fs` and `net` refuse: the two
/// `unsupported` lines in the transcript are "no ambient filesystem" and "no ambient network"
/// felt from inside std, on a binary that also runs both for real when it is granted them.
///
/// The `wall clock ok` line is milestone 51's half: `SystemTime::now()` reached a real time,
/// through a read-only page and the ambient counter, and the program asserted it was inside the
/// same sanity window the clock service applies. Before that milestone the same call returned
/// 1970 plus uptime and would have passed any test that only checked it did not crash.
///
/// The `config seeded` line is milestone 47's environment-variable fork (DECISIONS §111): this
/// process is granted an inert-configuration page unconditionally
/// (`std_service::start_on`/`CONFIG_SLOT`/`CONFIG_PAGE_STD`), assembled once from
/// `env_proto::PageBuilder` before the program exists, and `pal::nife::init` reads `TZ`, `LANG`
/// and `TERM` off it into `std::env`'s table before `main` runs. The line proves the whole path:
/// the kernel assembled and validated the page, mapped it read-only, the std PAL's probe found
/// the granted capability, and the values it read back are the exact ones the kernel wrote. The
/// `env ok` line just below depends on it: `vars().count()` is asserted at 3 rather than 0
/// precisely because this line's three keys are already there.
///
/// The `env ok` line is milestone 64's, and it is a third correction of the same shape, found by a
/// different method. `std::env::vars()` used to **abort the process**: nife had no `sys::env`
/// backend, so it fell through to the unsupported one whose `env()` is a `panic!`. Nothing in a
/// build failure list showed it, because it compiled. The line asserts three things at once: that
/// the call returns, that the listing holds exactly what this process's grants seeded and nothing
/// more (three keys from the config page above, not zero: milestone 47 gave the count a nonzero
/// honest answer where it used to be an always-empty one), and that `set_var` takes, since that
/// is what `set_var` means on every other platform.
///
/// The `paths ok` line is the same finding a third time, and it is why this test grew rather than
/// a new one appearing. `std::env::temp_dir()`, `std::env::split_paths()` and `std::process::id()`
/// were all `panic!` in the fallbacks nife had no arm in, so each of them **killed the program**
/// while compiling perfectly; `tempfile::NamedTempFile::new()` reached the first of them before it
/// ever got to its own "operation not supported" arm, which is not what the measurement note said
/// it did. The line asserts the two that now answer (`temp_dir` is the granted directory and
/// `TMPDIR` steers it; a path list survives a join and a split) and, just as deliberately, the
/// three that still refuse (`current_dir`, `current_exe`, `home_dir`), so that a later lane cannot
/// quietly turn a refusal into a fabricated answer.
///
/// The `entropy ok` line is milestone 56's half, and it is the same shape of correction:
/// `std::random` reached a virtio-rng device, through one endpoint that names no device, and
/// the program asserted two draws differ. Before that milestone the same call returned
/// splitmix64 seeded from boot-relative time, which would also have passed any test that only
/// checked it did not crash.
///
/// The `exiting through process::exit` line, and the two assertions after the transcript, are
/// milestone 64's fourth pass and the same shape a fourth time. `std::process::exit` fell through
/// to `crate::intrinsics::abort()`, so a program ending the way almost every CLI-shaped `main`
/// ends executed a trap and was reported to its supervisor as a crash. It was invisible to the
/// three earlier passes for a reason worth keeping: `sys/exit.rs` is not a `sys/<module>/mod.rs`
/// backend, so "read every module the PAL falls through" does not reach it, and `_start` calls
/// the PAL's own exit directly, so the *usual* way a program ends never went near the broken one.
/// `cargo xtask std-aborts` is the mechanism that replaces that reading.
