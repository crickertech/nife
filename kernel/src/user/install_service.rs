//! **The offer a booted stick makes, and the two programs that carry it out** (milestone 198 (a
//! package manager, and the trivial install that makes a second customer possible), rung 2a).
//!
//! The proposal it follows is milestone 515 (a stick that puts itself on the machine's disk).
//!
//! # What this module is, and what it deliberately is not
//!
//! It is the **boot policy**: decide whether this boot could install at all, say what would be
//! destroyed, ask, and then wire the two confined programs that do the work. It is not the
//! installer. Nothing here writes a byte to a disk.
//!
//! The split is the whole argument, and it is the one `disk_service` already makes for milestone
//! 57's partitioner:
//!
//! | | holds | can destroy |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | this module | the boot path, the console | nothing; it has no block endpoint of its own to spend |
//! | `components/src/installer.rs` | one disk, one entropy endpoint, a read-only copy of the boot file | that disk |
//! | `redoxfs_server`'s `mkfs` | the same disk, the same entropy endpoint | that disk |
//!
//! **The question is asked here rather than in the installer**, and that is not an accident of
//! where the console is. A confirmation a program prints to itself is a confirmation that program
//! could also decide to skip; asking before the capability is granted means the authority to wipe
//! the disk does not exist until the answer does.
//!
//! # When the offer is made
//!
//! Three things must be true, and all three are facts about the machine rather than preferences:
//!
//! 1. **This boot came from a file the loader could read back** (`memory::boot_file_region`), so
//!    there is something to install. A `-kernel` boot has no such file and is silently skipped.
//! 2. **There is an NVMe controller**, which is the disk an install would go to.
//! 3. **That disk does not already carry nife.** An installed machine boots from a file too, so
//!    without this check every boot of every installed machine would pause to offer to wipe itself.
//!    The check is a survey process, not a parse in the kernel: `installer`'s `ROLE_SURVEY`, spawned
//!    with the disk and **no entropy endpoint**. That is `disk_partitioner`'s verify role, one
//!    milestone along. **What the missing endpoint narrows is what the survey would write, not what
//!    it can** (2026-09-24 security audit): a `blk` endpoint is the whole disk with no read-only
//!    form, a reader of a partition table never checks that its ids were drawn from anywhere, so a
//!    survey that chose to could write any table, or zeros, anywhere on that disk. What stops it is
//!    the program's role, which is rung three of AGENTS.md's ladder; `confirm`'s section below
//!    prices the read-only `blk` that would make it rung one.
//! 4. **Somebody answers.** The wait is bounded, so a stick booted on a machine with no console
//!    reaches the prompt instead of hanging.
//!
//! Anything else is a refusal, and every refusal is silent-or-explained and then continues to the
//! ordinary boot. **Refusing by default is the whole safety property**: the only path to a write is
//! a person typing [`CONFIRMATION`].
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//!   install     : this system was booted from a file and can install itself.
//!   install     :   TARGET: the NVMe disk attached to this machine, 1073741824 bytes.
//!   install     :   EVERYTHING ON THAT DISK WILL BE DESTROYED.
//!   install     :   Type INSTALL and press return to proceed; anything else continues the boot.
//!   install     : > INSTALL
//!   install     : partitioning and copying the boot file...
//!   install     : installed. nife data at LBA 2048, EFI system at LBA 1046528.
//!   install     : filesystem created.
//!   install     : DONE. Remove the installation medium and reboot.
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **x86_64 only**, because `memory::boot_file_region` is: a device-tree handoff has one initrd
//!   slot in `/chosen` and no second one for the loader's own file. `uefi_loader`'s
//!   `place_boot_file` carries the argument and the gap, and
//!   `design/roadmap/568-the-boot-file-has-nowhere-to-go-on-a-device-tree-machine.md` prices
//!   closing it and names the three other things that still stand between it and an install on
//!   those architectures.
//! - **It asks on the console, which means the kernel reads the UART** (`console::read_line`).
//!   That is only sound because this runs before the progenitor hands the device to the input
//!   driver, and it is the reason the offer is made at this exact point in the boot and not later.
//! - **The disk is named by what it is, not by model and serial.** Milestone 515's `BUGS` asks for
//!   model and size, and only the size is here: reading a controller's model is a second IDENTIFY
//!   (`CNS_CONTROLLER`) in the admin plane and there is nowhere in
//!   `non_volatile_memory_express::Handoff` to put forty ASCII bytes, whose three scalars are all
//!   spent. On a machine with two disks this sentence would not say which, and that is why the
//!   offer says "the NVMe disk attached to this machine" rather than naming an ordinal it cannot
//!   back up. **It is the single most load-bearing sentence a stranger reads**, and it has a
//!   milestone of its own, `design/roadmap/569-the-disk-an-installer-names-has-no-model.md`,
//!   which finds that the kernel-side half needs no ruling and the program-side half is the wire
//!   question milestone 421 (the block roster cannot name an NVMe disk) is already held on.
//! - **Nothing here is crash-atomic**, and a power cut between the partitioner and `mkfs` leaves a
//!   partitioned disk with no filesystem, which the next boot reports as a disk it cannot mount.
//! - **It checks for nife and for nothing else.** A disk carrying Windows, or a Linux root, looks
//!   exactly like an empty one from here: the survey asks "is there a nife data partition" and any
//!   other answer is "installable". A person who says yes to the question loses that disk. Naming
//!   what is already on it is `disk_surveyor`'s job, and
//!   `design/roadmap/570-the-install-offer-should-say-what-is-already-on-the-disk.md` is the
//!   milestone for it.
//! - **A machine that already carries nife is never offered an install again**, which is what stops
//!   an installed system offering to wipe itself on every boot and also means there is no way to
//!   reinstall from the stick. The sharp case is a power cut between the installer and `mkfs`,
//!   which leaves a nife data partition with no filesystem in it and a machine that will never be
//!   offered an install again. `design/roadmap/572-there-is-no-way-back-from-the-stick.md`
//!   is the milestone, and the fix is a second question rather than a second mechanism.

///
/// # What "this boot worked" means here, and it is a promise rather than a mechanism
///
/// **The criterion is: the machine got far enough that a person can log in and fix whatever else is
/// wrong.** Concretely, at this call site, all of the following already happened:
///
/// | |
/// |---|
/// | the kernel came up, its self-tests passed, and it reached userspace |
/// | the NVMe controller was brought up and its server answered requests from ring 3 |
/// | the block server and the filesystem server started, and the filesystem server **mounted the installed disk and reported ready** |
/// | the progenitor was loaded out of the archive, measured against the trust root, and built |
///
/// Nothing is confirmed unless every one of those held, because this runs after all of them and
/// the boot does not reach here otherwise.
///
/// **Why not earlier, and why not later.** Confirming at the kernel's self-test would mark an
/// upgrade good that has no working disk and no userspace, which is the failure the whole feature
/// exists to prevent; the bias has to be late. Confirming later is what the rest of this comment
/// is about, and the honest answer is that later is not reachable automatically on this system
/// today: past this point the machine is waiting for a person, and an unattended appliance has
/// nobody to ask. The Boot Loader Specification leaves the call to the operating system for the
/// same reason, and ChromeOS's update engine sets the bit from userspace on the same judgement.
///
/// **What a boot that satisfies this criterion can still be wrong about**, which is the honest half
/// of the feature and is repeated in `crates/boot_slot`'s `BUGS` where a reader meets it:
///
/// - **Anything nothing exercises at boot.** The network stack, the compositor, a driver for a
///   device this machine has and the boot path does not touch. An upgrade that breaks only those
///   is confirmed and kept.
/// - **The shell**, which is the one thing the proposal's recommended criterion names and this does
///   not reach. The filesystem is mounted and the progenitor is built, but nothing has typed
///   anything. A regression between here and a prompt survives.
/// - **Anything that fails after the first few seconds**: a leak, a wedge under load, a filesystem
///   that mounts and then corrupts. This is a statement about coming up, not about running.
///
/// # What holds the authority to write the partition table, and how narrow it is
///
/// `components/src/installer.rs`'s [`ROLE_CONFIRM`], spawned here with four capabilities and
/// nothing else: the report endpoint, the disk's `blk` endpoint, the page it shares with that
/// disk's server, and a budget for the one page it maps itself. **No entropy endpoint**, so it
/// cannot draw the unique ids a new partition table carries and the only table it can write is the
/// one it read; **no boot file**, so it cannot rewrite the image it is vouching for; no console, no
/// filesystem, no network.
///
/// It is not as narrow as it should be, and the gap is named rather than papered over: a `blk`
/// endpoint is the whole disk, because nothing in `filesystem_protocol::blk` bounds a client to a
/// block range. So this process *could* write anywhere on that disk. That is the same limitation
/// `installer`'s own `BUGS` records for the filesystem server, it is one wire field away from
/// fixed, and it is the reason this is a boot-path call rather than something a program could ask
/// for later.
///
/// # What serialises this against the filesystem server, and the answer is an ordering
///
/// **Nothing enforces it.** One NVMe server has one transfer region, shared by every client of its
/// endpoint, and a client stages bytes into that region before it calls. Two clients staging at
/// once would corrupt each other, and no lock, lease or range check prevents it.
///
/// What makes this write safe is where it is: **after the filesystem server's ready report and
/// before the progenitor's first instruction.** In that window the filesystem server is blocked in
/// receive with no client that could wake it, because the kernel boot path is single-threaded and
/// is the only thing that can hand its endpoint to anybody. So the region has one user.
///
/// That is rung three of `AGENTS.md`'s ladder, a written record at the thing itself, and it is an
/// **exception** to the rule that the higher rung wins. It is stated as one: **this is a foot gun.**
/// The day something spawns a second disk client before the progenitor runs, or this call moves
/// after it, the ordering silently stops holding and the symptom is a corrupted partition table on
/// somebody's installed machine. The mechanism that would make it hold is a transfer region per
/// client, or a `blk` endpoint bounded to a block range; both are wire decisions and neither is
/// this lane's.
