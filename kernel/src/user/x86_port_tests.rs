//! **The load-bearing tests of the x86 port-range capability** (milestone 299, DECISIONS §121
//! reversed 2026-09-15; a third added by milestone 313's audit). A `PortRange` capability is enforced entirely at the context switch, by the
//! TSS I/O permission bitmap, with nothing on the syscall path to assert on; the only honest test is
//! a ring-3 program that executes `out` and observes whether the CPU allowed it. So these build
//! hand-assembled `x86_64` children (`super::x86_programs`) exactly as `supervision_tests` does, and
//! read the outcome from the child's supervision endpoint: a word arrives if the `out` was allowed,
//! an `EVENT_FAULT` if it was not.
//!
//! Two properties, both named load-bearing in the milestone's own BUGS:
//!
//! 1. **A non-holder cannot touch the port, and a holder's grant does not leak across a switch.**
//!    [`port_holder_transmits_then_a_non_holder_faults`] runs a holder (which transmits) and then a
//!    child with no port capability (which faults on the same `out`). The second running *after* the
//!    first is the hand-off test: if the switch away from the holder had left the TSS permitting the
//!    port, the non-holder would inherit it and not fault.
//! 2. **A revoked holder faults on its next `in`/`out`.**
//!    [`a_revoked_holder_faults_on_its_next_port_write`] parks a holder in `RECV`, revokes its port
//!    range while it is parked, wakes it, and confirms the `out` it then executes faults.
//! 3. **A holder that drops its own port capability faults on its next `in`/`out`.**
//!    [`a_holder_that_deletes_its_port_capability_faults_on_its_next_port_write`] is milestone 313's
//!    audit finding turned into a test: the first two prove the grant follows the capability across
//!    a switch and a revoke, and neither could see that `SYS_CAP_DELETE` left it behind.
//!
//! 4. **A holder that takes the range back from everyone else keeps its own bitmap.**
//!    [`a_take_back_leaves_the_invokers_own_bitmap_installed`] is the 2026-09-24 audit's finding
//!    turned into a test: `PortRange::REVOKE` spares the invoker's capability, and until that audit
//!    the arch half reset the invoker's own core anyway, so the sparing was true of the table and
//!    false of the hardware until the next switch-in.
//!
//! `x86_64` only: there is no port space, and no TSS I/O bitmap, on the other two architectures.
