//! **What a test-boot service holds, and the one call that hands it back.**
//!
//! # The problem this exists for
//!
//! A boot has one pool of physical frames. The aarch64 test suite builds a service, proves
//! something with it, and moves on; the service is still there when the next test starts, and every
//! frame it was given is spoken for until the machine stops. Measured on 2026-08-16, the suite
//! finished a boot with **216 free frames of the 29307 it started with, and no free run longer than
//! 106**, which is why an ordinary allocation began failing as `Unmappable(OutOfPageFrames)` in
//! whichever test happened to spawn last, about one run in three. Three milestones were misled by
//! that symptom, because the test that reports the failure is never the test that caused it.
//! notes/frames.md carries the ledger.
//!
//! # No new mechanism, and that is the point
//!
//! Everything here is DECISIONS §16 object revocation, already built and already proved:
//!
//! - [`crate::sched::kill_thread`] arms §16's kill on a thread by name (what `Untyped::DESTROY`
//!   does to a whole region, for one thread).
//! - [`crate::sched::reclaim_region`] tears every kernel object out of an untyped region, unpins it,
//!   and returns the memory. A first call that finds a live thread in the region **arms the kill on
//!   it and refuses**; the retry reclaims. `force_kill_tests` proves that loop on a runaway.
//! - A dead thread's address space dies with it (the `Drop` chain), which returns the region behind
//!   it without anyone naming that region at all.
//!
//! So a `Holding` is bookkeeping: remember what was handed out, and spend the existing verbs on it in
//! the order that works. There is no new syscall and no new kernel object.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A thread that only ever blocks cannot be reclaimed this way**, and the limit is §16's rather
//!   than this type's. The armed kill is spent by `schedule()`, which a `Blocked` thread never
//!   reaches, so [`Holding::release`](crate::user::holding::Holding::release) can end a thread that
//!   runs and cannot end one parked in `RECV` for good. What rescues the common case is that reclaiming a region **removes the endpoints
//!   inside it and wakes their waiters with an aborted IPC**, so a service blocked on an endpoint
//!   its own budget paid for does die. A service blocked on an endpoint from somewhere else does
//!   not, and [`Holding::release`](crate::user::holding::Holding::release) returns `false` rather than pretending: see
//!   `reap_region_objects`'s own note ("the cooperative tier's job").
//! - **`release` is destructive and cannot be used as a question.** Its first `reclaim_region` arms
//!   kills, so calling it to find out whether a service is idle ends the service. That is
//!   `reclaim_region`'s recorded BUGS entry, inherited here.
//! - **A holding names what the kernel handed out, not what the process built.** A process that
//!   retypes objects out of its own budget is covered (they are in the region); one that reaches
//!   memory some other way is not, and nothing here can see the difference.
//!
//! Name: **provisional** (this lane, 2026-08-16). `Holding` is a noun and says what the thing is:
//! what a service holds. It is deliberately *not* `Lease`, which reads better in the abstract and
//! would collide head-on with the DHCP lease this file's biggest caller talks about on every other
//! line (`notes/net.md`, `start_smb_serve`'s `(lease, smb)`). Crate, module and type names are
//! calef's call; expect this one to change.
