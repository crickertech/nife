/// collects the corpse (§32), and the region comes home. A component that merely stops answering
/// produces none of it, and this test is the machine saying so rather than a paragraph claiming it.
///
/// **Four results, and the first two are negative.**
///
/// 1. **The domain does not report a hang.** Every member of the survey is `BLOCKED`, none is `DEAD`,
///    and that is byte for byte what a healthy idle system reads as: `abi::survey::BLOCKED` is the
///    state of a server parked in `RECV_CAP`, which is every healthy server between requests. The
///    view milestone 126 built is the widest one a supervisor has and it cannot tell the difference.
/// 2. **The supervisor's whole vocabulary over its domain is refused.** `Rendezvous::REAP` is asked
///    about every member and answers `StillAlive` every time, on purpose: §32 authorizes collecting a
///    corpse and not killing. Against a hung component there is no corpse, so there is nothing to
///    say.
/// 3. **The service is restored with no authority the operator did not already hold**, which
///    contradicts §32's sentence that a supervisor restarting a hung child "still needs the stronger
///    right". The device comes back by `PageFrame::REVOKE` take-back, which asks the holder for nothing;
///    the replacement parks on the stable rendezvous and drains what queued behind the silence; the
///    client's stream closes over the hang. §32 is right about *reclaiming the hung component's
///    memory* and wrong about restarting its service, and those are different acts.
/// 4. **Restoring the service does not recover the caller that was mid-`CALL`.** That caller is
///    parked awaiting a reply, and a caller awaiting a reply is woken by `sched::ipc_reply` and by
///    nothing else in the kernel: `abi::Error::Gone` reaches a caller whose *rendezvous* died and never
///    one whose *server is alive and silent*. The one-shot `Reply` capability naming it is `WRITE`
///    without `GRANT`, inside the hung component's capability table, so the operator cannot answer on its
///    behalf, forge one, or revoke its way to it. In this run the wedge is deliberate and lets go
///    when asked. A real one does not, and `CL_WAS_RELEASED` is the bit that marks which of the two
///    this was.
///
/// **Nothing here waits on a clock**, and that is deliberate rather than incidental: the wedge fires
/// on the identity of one request, the hang is a `CALL` whose parked state is established inside the
/// same critical section that wakes the operator, and every assertion below is about program order.
/// A watchdog that decided "hung" from elapsed time would need the timed wait milestone 106 has not
/// decided, and a *test* that did would be the next load-sensitive assertion (milestone 62, 78).
