/// is spawned as a *second client of the same stack*, which the socket contract permits (clients sharing an endpoint share its
/// grant and its socket table; `socket_proto`'s BUGS): the echo client owns socket ids 0 and 1, the
/// SMB adapter 2 and 3, and the listen grant is widened to the two-port range
/// `[NET_LISTEN_PORT, smb_port]`, keeping the denied-port check (8080) meaningful.
///
/// `smb_rounds` connections must be served by the adapter before it reports; the host side is
/// xtask's SMB prober, the mirror of the inbound echo prober, driving a real
/// negotiate-through-read exchange through the second `hostfwd`.
///
/// `fs` is the adapter's directory capability into the FS service (milestone 54's second act):
/// [`spawn_stack_client`] documents its two halves. With `Some` the adapter serves the RedoxFS
/// share the seeding client just wrote; with `None` it serves its baked-in fixture.
///
/// `cred` is milestone 54's identity item, and it is the difference between a share anyone on the
/// forwarded port may change and one that wants a proof: the credential service's verify endpoint
/// and the frame it shares with a client. Pair it with `fs`'s mode being
/// [`SMB_SHARE_FS_AUTHENTICATED`]; the adapter refuses every login without the endpoint and admits
/// every guest without the mode, so the two are only useful together.
///
/// `udp_bind_grant` is the third milestone in the same spawn (55's mDNS stack half): the UDP port
/// range the socket client may `BIND_UDP`, [`socket_proto::udp_bind_grant`]'s half of the word, or
