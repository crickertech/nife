//! **Revocation against a mapping the kernel wired, rather than a mapping a capability made**
//! (the `map_physical` mapping record, 2026-09-21).
//!
//! **The defect this module was written to demonstrate was live in the tree and is fixed here.**
//! What follows describes the tree as it stood on 2026-09-21; [`AddressSpace::map_physical`] now
//! records, and `kernel/falsifications/` carries the patch that takes the record back out and turns
//! this test red.
//!
//! Every unmap sweep in `crate::revoke` is driven by the mapping log, and the only way into that
//! log is [`crate::revoke::record_mapping`]. `AddressSpace::map_physical` did not call it. So a
//! page the kernel wires into a process it is building (a [`super::Spawn`]`::maps` entry, a
//! [`super::DeviceRun`], the initrd read-only, the `x86_64` timebase page) was mapped into a live
//! address space with no record anywhere that it had been, and `PageFrame::REVOKE`,
//! `DeviceFrame::REVOKE` and `MemoryRegion::DESTROY` all walked straight past it. The capability
//! went and the mapping stayed, which is a take-back doing half its job.
//!
//! **This was reachable in an ordinary boot, and the path is one the tree wires deliberately.**
//! `user::fs_service::spawn_fs_server` puts the file channel's shared pages into the FS server
//! through `Spawn::maps`, and [`super::boot_progenitor`] hands the progenitor
//! `page_frame_cap(file_shared, WRITE|GRANT)` in slot 6 over the first of exactly those pages. A
//! `PageFrame::REVOKE` on that slot is a syscall the progenitor may make: it deleted every
//! capability naming the run and unmapped every mapping recorded under it, and the FS server kept
//! its writable mapping of a page the progenitor had just un-shared. The two halves were wired by
//! different modules, which is why nobody had put them side by side.
//!
//! **Why the fix is a required argument rather than a call.** `record_mapping` already takes
//! [`crate::revoke::PageMapSource`] as an argument with no default, for AGENTS.md's rung one: a
//! mapping that cannot say which capability made it is the record
//! DECISIONS §132 (what `PageFrame::REVOKE` owes an overlapping run) found missing. `map_physical`
//! was the
//! one mapping site that never had to answer, because it never recorded. It takes the same argument
//! now, so a caller must say, and recording is no longer something a caller can forget to do after
//! the fact: [`super::user_address_space_map`] used to be the one path that remembered, and it is
//! now the one path that has nothing extra to remember.
//!
//! **This module is a new file on purpose.** `kernel/src/user/tests.rs` is this tree's worst merge
//! hotspot and AGENTS.md's lane rules say to stay out of it. It is named to sort before
//! `thread_leak_police`, whose own header explains why that matters.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The test drives `PageFrame::REVOKE`'s sweep, not the other two.** `revoke_device_from_others`
//!   ([`DeviceFrame::REVOKE`]) and `revoke_region` ([`MemoryRegion::DESTROY`]) read the same log and
//!   are fixed by the same record, but nothing here drives a wired mapping through either, so read
//!   those as reasoned from the code rather than measured. `revoke_region`'s limb is the narrower
//!   one in practice: no `map_physical` call site in the tree maps a page that came from a
//!   `MemoryRegion`, so nothing reaches it today (see `map_physical`'s own docs).
//! - **The test proves the mapping is gone, not that the process faults on it.** Walking the page
//!   tables is what `crate::revoke`'s own suite asserts and it is what the sweep controls;
//!   demonstrating the fault needs a live process, which `user::live_swap_tests` does for the
//!   device case and at a whole boot's cost.
//! - **`AddressSpace::map_new` still does not record**, and is deliberately left alone. Its frames
//!   are retyped from the space's own backing region and freed with it, so no capability names them
//!   and no sweep can be asked about them. That is a different question from this one and its
//!   answer would be a different fix.
