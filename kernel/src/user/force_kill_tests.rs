/// **A `Reply` capability naming a torn-down caller does not survive the teardown**, which is the

///
/// `cap::reply_cap` mints `Object::Reply(tid)` whose payload is a generational thread name with
/// **no call identity**, and `sched::ipc_reply`'s guard checks the caller's `WaitRole` and discards
/// the rendezvous. That is sound only while nothing can leave a reply park and enter a second
/// `CALL` with an unconsumed `Reply` still naming it. A design that freed a stranded caller by
/// *waking* it would create exactly that path, and a hung server's stale `Reply` would then pass
/// the role check and forge an answer to a later, unrelated conversation. `L4Re` documents the
/// identical hazard as a consequence of its own finite receive timeouts and Zircon documents it
/// for `zx_channel_call`'s timeout; see notes/blocked-thread-teardown.md.
///
/// **Proposal A takes both of seL4's fixes rather than either.** The caller is never woken, which
/// is `ThreadState_Inactive` and means no second `CALL` can exist to be forged against; and the
/// outstanding capability is swept anyway, which is `cteDeleteOne(callerCap)` from `cancelIPC`.
/// This test pins the sweep, because the sweep is the half that a later change could quietly drop
/// while every capacity assertion above went on passing. **A change that traded a permanent block
/// for a forgeable reply would be a worse defect than the one it fixes**, and a test that asserted
/// only the reclaim would not notice.
///
/// The caller staged here is the hardest shape there is: its request was collected, so it sits on
/// **no queue at all** and no rendezvous sweep could reach it.
///
/// **Verified it can fail**: deleting the `delete_matching` sweep from
/// `sched::finish_blocked_resident` leaves the slot occupied and trips the middle assertion, while
/// the reclaim itself still succeeds.
