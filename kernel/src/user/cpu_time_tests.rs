//! **A thread's scheduled CPU time, as `SURVEY` reports it** (milestone 282 (a thread's CPU time, and the `top` it makes possible),
//! DECISIONS §150 (how does a thread's CPU time reach userspace?)).
//!
//! `survey_record_tests` proves the selector *mechanism*: that a record can be asked for, that an
//! unknown one is refused, that the walk is the same walk whichever record it is. This file proves
//! the one thing no mechanism test can, which is that the **number means what it says**. A record
//! that returned a constant zero, or that charged every tick to the wrong thread, would pass every
//! assertion in that file.
//!
//! Its own file, which is this tree's rule rather than a preference: `tests.rs` is the merge
//! hotspot every lane collides in.
//!
//! # The shape of the proof, and why it is a spinner against a sleeper
//!
//! CPU time is only meaningful as a comparison. An absolute figure could be wrong by any factor and
//! still look plausible, so the assertions here are all **differences between two threads in one
//! domain over one interval**: a runaway that never yields against a child parked in a send that
//! nobody receives. The runaway must gain; the sleeper must not. That pair also happens to be the
//! two ends of the accounting decision §150 made, since a wall-clock age would report the two
//! **identically** and is exactly what this catches.
//!
//! Arch-neutral (DECISIONS §19 (architectural parity is a tenet)), and here that is a claim and not a convenience. The counter
//! lives in `sched`, the increment is in `sched::on_tick`, and the only architecture-specific thing
//! in reach is the one-instruction spin loop, which `force_kill_tests` already keeps for all three.
//! So all three ISAs run literally these assertions.
