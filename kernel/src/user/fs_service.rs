/// **The spawn-protocol position that says which directory is which is the capability table slot**: the
/// confined program's slot 0 is always [`TwoDirGrant::a`], slot 1 always [`TwoDirGrant::b`].
/// That is the whole of what this milestone decides about the wire, deliberately: a shell-to-init
/// encoding for a *second* `DIR_BIT` grant (extending `grant_plan::spawnproto`'s `GRANT_WORDS`
/// precedent the way a real interactive `bind` eventually will) is a design fork this milestone's
/// own roadmap block leaves to whoever wires this into the shell.
///
/// Both caretakers share the one FS server this boot has: [`narrow_dir`]'s idempotent `ensure`
/// pays for wiring it once and the second call reuses what the first built. Both narrowed
/// endpoints end up mapping the **same** shared file-channel frame at [`FILE_VA_CLIENT`], and
/// that is safe for the reason [`narrow_dir`]'s own doc gives one level narrower: the confined
/// program is one thread of control with at most one `CALL` in flight, so it is never mid-request
/// on both caretakers at once, whichever it happens to be talking to at a given moment owns the
/// page exclusively for the length of that call.
