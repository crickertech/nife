//! Name: ratified 2026-09-15 (calef, the doc on `wire`, moved here 2026-09-24), as
//! `call_reply_service`. The wiring folds onto the same `call_reply` stem as the two fixtures it
//! spawns, so `git grep call_reply` finds the pair and their kernel-side wiring as one family.
//! Module/file rename pending the batched 291 sweep.

/// milestone 291, so this took one image and two role numbers; they are `fixtures/src/call_server.rs`
