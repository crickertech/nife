//! **The wiring for the three network time programs** (milestone 51; split from one binary by
//! milestone 290).
//!
//! Until milestone 290 there was one `ntp` binary with three `arg0` roles. There are three programs
//! now: `components/src/network_time_client.rs`, `fixtures/src/network_time_test_server.rs` and
//! `fixtures/src/unwritable_clock_witness.rs`.
//!
//! **The invariant this file carries is that the client and the witness are endowed by one
//! function.** `spawn_with_client_endowment` takes the image as a parameter, so a slot added to
//! the client is a slot the witness gets, and there is no second capability list to forget. That,
//! rather than the two sharing a binary, is what keeps
//! `an_ntp_client_holds_no_writable_clock_page` proving what it claims: the fault comes from the
//! capability set, and any process holding that set faults at that address whatever code it runs.
//! **Do not grow a second list here.** A hand-maintained copy of a fact the wiring already holds is
//! how a confinement claim decays without breaking a build (milestone 117's `swish` `caps` bug).
