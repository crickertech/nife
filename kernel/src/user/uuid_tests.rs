/// This is the half of milestone 111 that carries the claim. The endowment is the easy direction:
/// wire a capability, watch a program use it. The claim is the other one, that authority a program
/// did not declare is not quietly available anyway, and randomness is the authority where that is
/// hardest to check by looking: a process that draws a key and a process that hardcodes one make
/// the same syscalls and produce output of the same shape. Nothing but a test that takes the
/// capability away can tell them apart.
///
/// So the assertions are about **silence**. Not one byte of the 36-character identifier reaches the
/// sink, the whole stream is the one sentence, and the process ends normally rather than faulting
/// on a `CALL` that could not succeed. A `uuid` that fell back to a counter, a boot-time seed or a
/// monotonic tick would pass no part of this, which is exactly the fallback `crates/gpt` refuses to
/// provide and `disk_partitioner` refuses to invent.
///
/// Arch-neutral, so **both ISAs run literally this test** (DECISIONS §19): what is under test is
/// the capability model's answer to an empty slot, which is not instruction-set-specific.
