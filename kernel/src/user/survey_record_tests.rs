//! **The `SURVEY` selector, and the one record it ships with: a thread's placement.**
//!
//! `survey_tests` proves the *walk*: what a domain contains and who may look at it. This file
//! proves the *selector*, which is the other axis calef's 2026-09-21 ruling added: which per-thread
//! fact a walk asks for. The two are deliberately separate files rather than one, because the
//! properties are independent and the failures read completely differently. A broken walk reports
//! the wrong threads; a broken selector reports the wrong fact about the right threads, which is
//! the more dangerous of the two, because every tid still looks correct.
//!
//! Its own file also keeps this out of `tests.rs`, which is the tree's merge hotspot.
//!
//! Arch-neutral, and that is a claim rather than a convenience DECISIONS §19 (architectural parity is a tenet). Placement is
//! `sched`'s: `pick_spawn_target` samples two online cpus' runnable counters and `place_on` puts
//! the thread on the winner, and not one line of either is under `arch/`. So all three
//! architectures run literally these assertions, and a divergence would mean something is wrong in
//! the scheduler rather than in an ISA.
