//! The tests for milestone 151 (notification objects), which builds DECISIONS §101 (notification objects), on
//! every architecture.
//!
//! Each proves something the crate's Kani harnesses cannot, because it is about the kernel half:
//! the registry, the wake, the TCB binding reaching into another object's wait queue, the syscall
//! layer's rights and registers, and teardown. The state machine itself (no bit lost, a waiter
//! before the bound receiver, the invariant) is proved in
//! `crates/inter_process_communication/src/notification.rs` and not re-tested here.
