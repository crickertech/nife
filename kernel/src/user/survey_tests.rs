/// **`pgrep`: the filter over the same domain, and the fourth answer it adds** (milestone 126).
///
/// This is the only place in the tree that can drive the filter with a real selector over a real
/// kernel domain. At the prompt the selector arrives in a register and nothing carries bytes from a
/// command line to a program, so a shell-spawned `pgrep` always takes the default and names every
/// member (`crates/pgrep`'s `BUGS`). Here a selector can be handed over directly.
///
/// Four answers, all distinct, all over one rendezvous the kernel really built:
///
/// - **members matched**: `pgrep dead` names the corpse and neither live child;
/// - **nothing matched**: `pgrep ready` over a domain of three says so, and it is *not* the empty
///   answer and *not* a refusal. Upstream `pgrep` cannot tell these apart, because there all three
///   are "print nothing, exit 1", so a monitor cannot distinguish an idle machine from a closed
///   door;
/// - **the domain is empty**: `crates/ps`'s sentence, reused rather than restated;
/// - **refused**: a send-only holder, loudly, keeping milestone 108's shape.
///
/// And the claim the whole pair exists to make, asserted rather than promised: **the tid `pgrep`
/// printed cannot be reaped through the capability that printed it.** That is why there is no
/// `pkill` here. A domain names its members and does not act on them (calef, 2026-08-17).
