/// that had not reached its serve loop, and the whole boot would deadlock with a sender and a
/// caller both waiting on nobody. The entropy service does not show this because its wiring

/// **`pub(super)` since milestone 54's identity item**, because the SMB gate needs the same sealed
/// store: its adapter authenticates a real NTLMv2 session against this service, so the SMB test
/// calls this to get the verify endpoint. Calling it from either place is safe in either order,
