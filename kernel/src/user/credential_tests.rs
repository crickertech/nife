/// Wire the whole system once: the entropy service, the credential service, and the

/// and the service's readiness report.
///
/// Once per boot, because the seal is irreversible: a second provisioner would `CALL` an
/// endpoint whose receiver is gone and block forever, which is the correct behaviour and a
/// terrible test.
///
/// **The readiness message is taken here and not in the test that asserts on it**, which cost a
/// hang to learn. A `SEND` on this kernel's endpoints is a rendezvous: it blocks until somebody
/// receives. The credential service sends its readiness word between the seal and the serve
/// loop, so a test that let a client `CALL` before draining that message would find a service
/// that had not reached its serve loop, and the whole boot would deadlock with a sender and a
/// caller both waiting on nobody. The entropy service does not show this because its wiring
/// receives immediately.
/// **`pub(super)` since milestone 54's identity item**, when the SMB gate needed the same sealed
/// store: its adapter authenticated a real NTLMv2 session against this service, so that test
/// calls this to get the verify endpoint. Calling it from either place is safe in either order,
/// which is what the once-per-boot latch below is for; what would not be safe is a *second*
/// wiring, and there is no way to ask for one.
///
/// Returns `None` if the mmio virtio-rng device this depends on is not attached (milestone 145:
/// correct on a bare board boot with no `NIFE_RNG`-equivalent). The `None` result is itself
/// memoized alongside the success case, so a board boot's first caller pays for the failed probe
/// once and every later caller gets the same answer immediately rather
