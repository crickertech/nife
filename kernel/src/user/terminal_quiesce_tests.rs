//! **A terminal can be quiesced for replacement without stranding its reader** (milestone 23 (a
//! capability-routed component OS with live replacement); calef's ruling of 2026-09-26, "1a and
//! 2b"). `OP_QUIESCE` rides the terminal endpoint, and a parked `OP_READLINE` or `OP_READRAW` is
//! answered `FLAG_RETRY` before the terminal stops receiving, because the reply capability that
//! names the reader cannot leave `line_editor`'s capability table.
//!
//! The test plays the supervisor as well as the input driver and the reader, on the harness
//! `raw_mode_service` already provides. What it proves is the incumbent's half of a swap: the
//! reader is handed back, the half-typed line survives a resume, and the resumed read repaints
//! nothing. The replacement's half needs the handoff page count first
//! (`design/roadmap/proposals/a-region-retypes-a-frame-run.md`).
