// judgment as `virtio_service`'s DMA page ("twenty page frames is not worth the hazard"): three
// pages times six raw_mode_tests plus two rmle_tests call sites is eight tests' worth, already
// inside `SUITE_PAGE_FRAME_BUDGET`'s headroom (`[that test kept N frames]` on this suite shows 31
// or 33, not the ~112 that leaving the *threads* unreclaimed would have cost per call). Worth
// fixing only if a future caller adds enough call sites to matter.
