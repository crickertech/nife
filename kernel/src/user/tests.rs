///
/// **This test fails without the shootdown**, which is the property worth having. The sequence:
///
///   1. a probe thread on **another** core installs space A and reads `VA`, which is what pulls the
///      translation into *that* core's TLB, tagged with A's ASID, and **leaves it installed**
///   2. this core moves `VA` onto a different frame **with no per-address invalidation at all**, so
///      the only thing that can announce the change anywhere is the ASID sweep
///   3. this core calls `flush_asid`
///   4. the probe reads `VA` again, on the same core, with the same space still installed
///
/// Step 4 must see the new frame. If the sweep stayed local it sees the old one, and that byte is
/// exactly the bug: a core still translating an address space that no longer means what it did.
///
/// Two of those choices are load-bearing. **The space is never re-installed**, because a `satp` or
/// `TTBR0` write between the reads is a second event a core (or an emulator) is entitled to treat as
/// a flush, and then step 4 would be right for a reason that has nothing to do with the shootdown.
/// And the mapping is **changed rather than recycled**: tearing the space down and handing its ASID
/// to a new one is the scenario that matters in production, but the allocator would likely hand the
/// new space the dead one's frames, and reading the right byte off the right frame by accident is
/// the same failure of proof.
///
/// # BUGS
///
/// - **The probe is placed, not pinned.** `spawn_on` is a hint and an idle core may steal, so the
///   probe records where it actually ran and the test asserts only that it was not *this* core. It
///   cannot land here: this thread spins without yielding, so its core never goes idle and never
///   steals. Both of the probe's reads happen inside one thread with interrupts masked, so they
///   cannot land on two different cores.
/// - **It needs two cores** and skips nothing if it has one: it fails, because the runner passes
///   `-smp 4` on both ISAs and a machine that came up single-core is a finding, not a reason to be
///   quiet.
/// - **A broken shootdown could hang this test instead of failing it**, if the reason it were broken
///   were that the remote core never services the request. The probe's spin is deadline-bounded and
///   reports `PROBE_GAVE_UP` so that case is named rather than silent, but the failure text would
///   then be about the handshake and the real cause would be one level down.

/// Milestone 72. It opened by asserting `reclaim_region(thread_control_block_region).is_err()` while the child was
/// still runnable, over a comment reading "the refusal leaves the region untouched". That comment
/// went stale when DECISIONS §16 was amended: a refused reclaim is **not** passive, it *arms the
/// kill* on every live thread in the region so the owner's retry can tear a runaway down (§24's
/// `^C` escalation depends on it). So the probe marked this child `killed`, and `schedule()`
/// converts a killed thread to a corpse at its next preemption. Win the race and the child reaches
/// its `SEND` first and the test passes; lose it and the child is reaped without ever sending, the
/// `ipc_recv` below never returns, and the machine goes fully idle: the intermittent lost-wakeup
/// hang that kept `cpu-matrix` red on branches that could not have caused it.
///
/// Proved by widening the window rather than by waiting for the race: a call-free delay loop in
/// front of `REPORT_STUB` guarantees a preemption before the `SEND`, and with the probe present
/// that hangs the watchdog on **both** ISAs, first run, every run. It is not a RISC-V defect; the
/// riscv64 leg simply lost the race more often. With the probe gone the same widened child passes.
///
/// The refusal itself is not lost coverage: `force_kill_tests` proves refuse-then-arm-then-reclaim
