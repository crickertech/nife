//! **The block-device roster and the disk surveyor** (milestone 57, notes/block-devices.md).
//!
//! The kernel's whole part in "what drives are attached" is here, and it is deliberately two
//! separate acts:
//!
//! 1. **Write the roster.** One page, laid out by `block_roster`, listing every block device the
//!    kernel's own scans found, and mapped **read-only** into whichever program was granted it. It
//!    carries no capacity and no address, because a listing is not a handle.
//! 2. **Hand one device to one process.** The block server owns the DMA and the transport for
//!    exactly one disk (`fs_service::spawn_block_server`, unchanged); the surveyor holds an
//!    endpoint to it and a page they share.
//!
//! Those two authorities are what milestone 57 is about. `parted /dev/sda` as root holds both at
//! once and can reach any disk in the machine; here the program with the listing cannot open
//! anything from it, and the program with the disk was handed exactly one.
//!
//! The kernel never reads a partition table. It finds a device, confines it, and hands over
//! endpoints; every byte of GPT judgement happens in userspace, in a crate whose tests run on the
//! host against tables `sgdisk` and macOS `diskutil` wrote (notes/gpt.md).
//!
//! # The pages are capabilities now (milestone 108, notes/frames.md)
//!
//! Both of those pages used to arrive as `Spawn::maps` entries: the kernel wrote them into the new
//! address space before the program's first instruction, at an address the kernel picked, with
//! permissions the kernel picked. Nothing in the program's capability table said they were there.
//!
//! They are `Frame` capabilities now, and the program maps them itself with `Frame::MAP`, spending
//! page tables out of an untyped it also holds. Four things change and none of them are cosmetic:
//! the rights are **attenuable** (`READ` on the roster is refused a writable mapping before a page
//! table is touched, rather than being caught by a permission bit afterwards), the frame is
//! **delegable** onward, the mapping is **recorded** so `Frame::REVOKE` can pull it back
//! (`disk_tests::the_roster_can_be_revoked_out_from_under_its_holder` is that claim), and the
//! authority is **legible**: reading this file's `grant_at` calls tells you the whole of what the
//! surveyor can reach, which is what CLAUDE.md means by a process's authority being readable in its
//! spawn literal.
//!
//! What stays wired at spawn is the **stack**, and that is a floor rather than an omission: a
//! program cannot map its own stack, because it needs a stack before it can make the syscall that
//! would map one.
