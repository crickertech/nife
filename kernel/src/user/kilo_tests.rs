//! **`kilo` itself, driven with real keystrokes over the raw-keystroke primitive, saving a real
//! file** (milestone 169's second half).
//!
//! The proof shape mirrors [`raw_mode_tests`](super::raw_mode_tests): the test plays the input
//! driver on `kilo`'s terminal, and the file it edits is verified **independently**, by the test
//! opening the same granted directory itself after `kilo` has exited and reading the bytes back,
//! rather than trusting `kilo`'s own report. That is the two-witness discipline this tree already
//! uses for the confined-C test (`c_seam`'s confiner) and the framebuffer test (driver digest and
//! client digest, taken from two different address spaces): neither witness here is `kilo` grading
//! its own homework.
