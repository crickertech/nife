//! Untyped memory. **The kernel stops allocating.**
//!
//! Milestone 11, and DECISIONS.md §10's deliberately-deferred third axis. The idea, from seL4:
//! the kernel does not own a pool it hands out from. Instead a process holds a capability to a
//! chunk of raw memory (an `Untyped` region, `capability::Object::Untyped`), and to get a page it
//! **retypes** part of that memory into the thing it wants. The kernel is a bookkeeper: it advances a watermark and hands
//! back a physical address. It calls no allocator.
//!
//! # What this buys, and the one number that proves it
//!
//! After a process is handed its untyped, **the kernel's free-frame count does not move while the
//! process allocates.** Every page the process maps comes out of its own untyped, carved once at
//! the start. A process cannot make the kernel allocate, so it cannot exhaust kernel memory: it
//! can only run out of *its own* budget, and when it does, the retype fails and the kernel is
//! untouched. That is the astonishing property, and `notes/untyped.md` shows the flat frame count.
//!
//! # Where the boundary sits now (updated across milestone 14)
//!
//! Milestone 11 converted the memory a process **asks for** (`Untyped::MAP` pages) to untyped.
//! Milestone 14 phase B.4 converted the memory a process **is made of**: `exec` carves one
//! region per process and the address space's root, tables, and image pages are all retyped
//! from it, so teardown is [`destroy`] and the whole budget returns in one call. The kernel's
//! own objects went fixed instead of untyped-backed (TCBs in a static pool, endpoints in a
//! fixed table; notes/tcb.md records why retype earns nothing while the kernel is the only
//! payer). What remains heap-backed is the revocation database, phase C's work.

//!
//! # Where the bookkeeping lives (milestone 135)
//!
//! The table itself, and every decision taken over it, is `crates/regions`: host-testable, Kani-
//! proved for the arithmetic, and searched by loom for the racing case (`script/interleaving-check`).
//! What stays here is what a crate a model checker can run must not have, which is the I/O: the
//! frame allocator, the direct map, the revoke, and the lock. The division is not tidiness. The
//! double free at `crates/frames/src/lib.rs:315` was a *protocol* bug, and a protocol that lives in
//! a `no_std` kernel module is reachable by neither of this project's two verification tools.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **`Error::OutOfMemory` collapses three unrelated causes into one code** (milestone 153). `SPLIT`
//! returns it when the caller's own untyped budget is exhausted, when the caller's cspace is full,
//! or when [`MAX_REGIONS`] itself is exhausted; `RETYPE_OBJ` collapses a different pair the same
//! way (see each method's own doc comment in `crates/abi`). The first two are facts about the
//! caller; the third is a fact about every other live region on the machine, which the caller had
//! no part in causing and cannot fix locally. A caller, or a person debugging one, cannot currently
//! tell which is true. **Declined for now (DECISIONS §119), for want of a customer**: no caller is
//! confused by this today, and §119 records non-binding guidance (new cause-specific `Error`
//! variants, the shape `crates/timetable`'s own `Unbacked`/`Refusal` split and POSIX's
//! `EMFILE`/`ENFILE` both already use) for whoever eventually has one.
