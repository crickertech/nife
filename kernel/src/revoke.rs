//! Capability revocation and untyped reclamation (milestone 13, DECISIONS §13; storage reworked
//! at milestone 14 phase C).
//!
//! Until now a granted capability could not be retracted and a spent page could not be reclaimed.
//! That was safe only by a structural accident: retyped frames are **spend-only, never reused**
//! (untyped.rs), so a peer that still mapped a shared frame after the granter left was mapping
//! valid, non-reused memory. `memory_region::destroy` carried a tripwire saying exactly this: wiring up
//! any reclamation before revocation exists turns those "harmless" dangling mappings into a
//! use-after-free.
//!
//! This module is that revocation. It keeps a **mapping database, lite**: every mapping of an
//! untyped-derived page, and since §132 the object each mapping was made under.
//!
//! # Two scopes, because two questions are being asked
//!
//! **Reclamation asks "is this page safe to hand out again", so it is object-blind.**
//! `memory_region::destroy` unmaps a page from *every* address space that held it and deletes every
//! capability whose run overlaps the range, after which no holder maps it and no capability names
//! it. Anything less is §13's use-after-free, because the allocator is about to give the memory to
//! somebody else.
//!
//! **`PageFrame::REVOKE` asks "whose authority is being taken back", so it is capability-scoped**
//! (DECISIONS §132, option C, decided 2026-08-27). It reclaims nothing (a region is spend-only), so
//! a mapping made under a *different* capability over the same physical memory is somebody else's
//! authority and survives. §102 is what made those two answers diverge: once one capability can name
//! a run, two capabilities can overlap, and the tree's display wiring has three that do.
//!
//! seL4 keeps a full capability-derivation tree and revokes a *subtree*. This keeps no tree: the
//! object address in each record stands in for one, because `derive` never changes the object, so
//! one word matches a capability and all of its derivatives.
//!
//! # Who pays for the records (phase C, the heap's last customer)
//!
//! The database used to be a global `Vec`: one entry per user mapping, growing without bound, on
//! the kernel's heap. **Now the mapper pays.** Each address space's records live in log pages
//! retyped from *its own* untyped region, reached through a fixed registry of live spaces (root,
//! region, log head). A process that maps a thousand shared pages spends its own budget recording
//! them; a process that cannot afford the record cannot make the mapping. And teardown got
//! simpler, not more complex: the log pages are region pages, so `memory_region::destroy` reclaims the
//! records with the process, and "forget this root" is one registry slot going empty.

/// One recorded mapping: `va` in the owning space maps `phys`, **under the capability whose run
/// starts at `object`**. `phys == 0` is a tombstone (RAM starts at `0x4000_0000` on this board, so
/// no real frame is 0).
///
/// # Why the third word exists (DECISIONS §132, option C)
///
/// Without it a revocation cannot tell *which* capability produced a mapping, so `PageFrame::REVOKE`
/// had to unmap the physical page from every space that held it, whoever mapped it and under
/// whatever authority. §102 made that visible by letting one capability name a run: the tree's own
/// display wiring has a driver holding `PageFrame(dma, 312)` and two clients holding
/// `PageFrame(dma + 4096, 311)` over the same memory, so a client's revoke reached into the
/// driver's space under a capability nobody revoked.
///
/// **The run's base address identifies the capability, derivatives included**, and that is the
/// whole reason one word is enough: `Cap::derive` narrows rights and never changes the object, so
/// matching on the object matches the entire derivation family without the §13 derivation tree this
/// kernel deferred.
///
/// **A mapping made with no `PageFrame` capability at all records itself as its own object**
/// (`object == phys`): `MemoryRegion::MAP` retypes a page and maps it in one step, and there is
/// never a capability to name. That is the honest encoding rather than a sentinel, because the page
/// really is the whole of what was mapped.
///
/// # BUGS
///
/// **Two capabilities sharing a base but not a length are one object here.** `PageFrame(p, 401)`
/// and `PageFrame(p, 74)` are distinct objects to `Cap`, and a revoke of the shorter one unmaps the
/// longer one's mappings of the pages they share. Carrying the length too would cost a fourth word
/// and take `LOG_ENTRIES` from 170 to 127 (a `LogEntry` would round up to 32 bytes), which is twice
/// the log pages a space pays now rather than 1.5x, to separate a pair nothing in the tree mints.
/// The failure is bounded in the safe direction: the over-broad unmap can only reach pages inside
/// the revoked run, and it is strictly narrower than the space-blind unmap this replaced. Named
/// here because a reader who trusts "capability-scoped" without qualification would be wrong.

/// invoked names the whole run, so the whole run is what gets deleted and unmapped, in one syscall
/// regardless of how many pages the run holds.
///
/// The two passes are not the same granularity on purpose. Capability deletion is one exact-object
/// match against `(phys, count)`, because that is the one capability (and its narrowed derivatives)
/// this invocation could possibly be revoking. Unmapping stays per-page, because the mapping
/// database records one entry per mapped virtual page regardless of how long the run is
/// (`PageFrame::MAP` loops over the run and records each page individually); that granularity does
/// not change here.
///
/// **Both passes are scoped to the invoked capability's derivation family** (DECISIONS §132, option
/// C, decided 2026-08-27). The capability pass always was: `derive` narrows rights and never
/// changes the object, so exact-object equality *is* the family. The unmap pass now is too, and
/// that is what changed here: it takes only the mappings recorded under this run's base, so
/// revoking a client's `PageFrame(dma + 4096, 311)` no longer reaches into the gpu driver's space,
/// which holds `PageFrame(dma, 312)` over the same physical memory and was never revoked. What
/// makes one word enough to say "and its derivatives" is [`LogEntry`], which carries the reasoning
/// and the one case it cannot separate.
///
/// # BUGS
///
/// **A capability whose run overlaps this one is left holding authority over pages this call has
/// unmapped out of *its own* holders' spaces**, and that is now deliberate rather than a gap: §102
/// contemplates two capabilities coexisting over sub-ranges of one region, and letting a one-page
/// holder delete a 312-page capability by naming a page inside it is an authority a one-page
/// capability should not have (§132 option B, refused). The overlapping holder keeps both its
/// capability and its mappings; only what was mapped under *this* capability goes.
///
/// **Revocation still owes a device nothing** (§132's question 3, deliberately not answered by this
/// work). `PageFrame::REVOKE` is a CPU-side operation: the gpu driver registers its DMA window with
/// `virtio::register`, that window is not derived from any capability, and revoking one does not
/// narrow it. So a capability-perfect revocation of a surface leaves the device able to write those
/// pages until the driver's virtio registration is itself torn down. Coupling `PageFrame` and
/// `Virtio`, which are independent today, is a separate decision and remains calef's call: see
/// design/decisions/132-overlapping-page-frame-runs.md.

/// to be returned to the allocator and reused. A device page is never reclaimed; revoking it exists
/// to make ownership **exclusive**, which is what live replacement needs between tearing one driver
/// down and endowing the next. A take-back that also deleted the invoker's capability would leave

/// the outcome a live replacement must not have: after this call the device has one owner. So it
