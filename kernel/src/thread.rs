//! Kernel threads.
//!
//! # What a thread actually is
//!
//! From notes/registers.md, milestone 1, before any of this existed:
//!
//! > **A thread is a stack plus a set of register values.** That is not a metaphor. It is the
//! > complete and literal definition.
//!
//! And that is exactly what a [`Thread`] is here: a [`KernelStack`], and a single **stack
//! pointer** naming the place on that stack where its registers are saved. Nothing else. The
//! `context` field is 8 bytes, and it is the whole of a suspended thread's CPU state, because
//! everything else is sitting on the stack it points at.
//!
//! # Every thread gets a guard page
//!
//! Milestone 3 blew the boot stack, wrote through `.bss` and `.data` into `.text`, and hung
//! the machine for 150 seconds with no output. Milestone 4 gave the *boot* stack a guard page,
//! and the same bug became an instant, precise fault naming the exact byte that went too far.
//!
//! Thread stacks get one too, and it is not decoration: **a thread stack is 24 KiB**, well under
//! half the boot stack's, and threads are where deep recursion actually happens. This is the
//! first non-test user of `mmu::map_page` / `mmu::unmap_page`, which we built at milestone 4
//! ahead of any caller precisely so the discipline (break-before-make, an un-ignorable TLB
//! flush) would be right the first time.
