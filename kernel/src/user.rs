//! Userspace. EL0. The actual operating system boundary.
//!
//! Everything before this was a Rust program that boots. From here on, the machine runs code
//! that **we did not compile and do not trust**, and the kernel's job stops being "do things"
//! and starts being "decide what is allowed."
//!
//! # Entering EL0 is returning from an exception that never happened
//!
//! There is no "drop to EL0" instruction. There is only `eret`, which restores whatever
//! `SPSR_EL1` says and jumps to `ELR_EL1`, and the exception level to return to is *in*
//! `SPSR_EL1`. So we do not need a new way down. We need a **fake way back**: fabricate a
//! [`TrapFrame`] with `SPSR = EL0t`, point `sp` at it, and fall into the `exception_restore`
//! that milestone 2 already wrote.
//!
//! This is the second time the project has pulled exactly this trick. `Thread::spawn` fakes a
//! `switch_to` frame so that the `ret` which *resumes* a thread also *starts* one
//! (notes/threads.md). Both times the "start" path turned out to be the "resume" path with a
//! forged frame, and no new code at all.
//!
//! # What milestone 4 already paid for
//!
//! The kernel lives entirely in `TTBR1`, at `0xffff_...`. Userspace lives in `TTBR0`, at
//! `0x0000_...`. **The hardware picks the table register from bits 63:48 of the address**, so:
//!
//! - The kernel is mapped in every address space, for free. Nobody had to copy anything.
//! - A syscall **does not switch page tables**. There is nothing to flush and nothing to remap.
//! - Installing a process is one `msr ttbr0_el1`.
//!
//! None of that was written for milestone 7. It fell out of a higher-half decision made three
//! milestones ago, and `Flags::user_code()` / `Flags::user_data()` have been sitting in the
//! `paging` crate, unused, waiting for today.
//!
//! # What is deliberately NOT here
//!
//! **A syscall ABI.** The user program below executes `svc #0` and asks for nothing. There is
//! no syscall number, no argument convention, no return value. DECISIONS §10 chose
//! capabilities, and the syscall surface gets designed against a capability table at 7d, in one
//! piece, on purpose. Not accreted here because it was convenient.

    // function's own stack. That traded a deterministic overlap for an intermittent one, and
    // milestone 71 caught it: `current_sp()` is a real call at opt-level 0, so it returned
    // `sp - 16`, which put the frame at `sp - 304` while `trap.s` builds an S-mode trap frame at
    // `sp - 288`. The two differ by exactly 16 bytes, so the user frame's `x[2]` (the user `sp`)
    // sat precisely on the trap frame's `x[0]` slot, which `trap.s` writes as a literal zero. Any

    // frame: user `sp` read 0 every time, `sepc` read whatever `t5` held, and `sstatus` read the
    // trap's `scause` (whose UXL bits are 0, an illegal U-mode XLEN). When `t5` happened to be 0 the

/// space (its segments, a deep stack, and the whole initrd mapped read-only so it can parse and load

/// line discipline and the shell out of the progenitor's own budget and wires them together; the
/// kernel touches none of it. It does not block: the progenitor and its children run on the
/// scheduler while the boot thread parks.
///
/// **The capability slot layout is the same on all three architectures** (milestone 166's point):
/// the delegable root budget at slot 0, the console device at slot 1, the UART receive interrupt at
/// slot 2, the wall clock page read-only at slot 3 (milestone 51's wiring), the inert-configuration
/// page read-only at slot 4 (milestone 47's environment-variable fork, DECISIONS §111), the file
/// service and the page its clients share at slots 5 and 6 when a RedoxFS disk is attached (milestone
/// 50), the virtio-rng trio at 7-9, the graphical terminal stack at 10-12 and the virtio-net trio
/// at 13-15 (milestone 590 (the booted system starts its network stack)) when each is present.
/// That fills sixteen of the table's
/// twenty-four slots at spawn, which is why the progenitor spends the net trio before anything else.
/// `components/src/progenitor.rs`'s single `GRANTS` table reads exactly this. Until milestone 166
/// aarch64's boot carried two extra capabilities at slots 1 and 3 (a report endpoint and a test
/// interrupt) that the interactive system never used, only because its loader was shared with
/// milestone 19d's test roles; [`spawn_hello`] is that shared role path, now boot-free.
///
/// **Only two differences are the hardware's, and only those are `#[cfg]`-gated**:
/// - **The console device (slot 1).** aarch64 and riscv64 grant the UART's registers as a
///   `DeviceFrame` (a page), `WRITE|GRANT` so the progenitor maps them into the console and input
///   drivers it builds. `x86_64` has no page for its console (COM1 is port I/O), so it grants a
///   `PortRange` over `0x3F8..=0x3FF` instead (milestone 299, DECISIONS §121 reversed 2026-09-15):
///   the progenitor delegates it with `CAP_INSERT` rather than `MAP_INTO`, and the kernel's TSS I/O
///   bitmap is what lets the drivers' `in`/`out` reach exactly these ports.
/// - **Arming the interrupt controller.** aarch64's GIC has no boot-hart lottery, so its UART line
///   is enabled inline before the thread is built and its virtio-rng source as its caps are inserted;
///   riscv64 enables the PLIC source and supervisor external interrupts only after the driver is
///   running, because the lottery forbids arming earlier (see [`VirtioBootGrant::intid`]); `x86_64`
///   arms nothing here, because it has no userspace input driver to feed until DECISIONS §149.

/// 2. *The fault is the bug we planted.* The kernel's reported fault address equals the address the C
///    code computed, so the crash is not something unrelated on the way there, which would make the
///    rest of the assertions vacuous.
/// 3. *Nothing outside the grant changed.* Two witness pages, both position-derived patterns
///    checked byte by byte through the confiner's own mappings. `WITNESS_RO` is the **same physical
///    frame** the component holds read-only, so an unchanged page is not "the store landed

///    **different frame at the same virtual address**, which is the statement that a virtual
///    address means nothing outside the address space that owns it.
/// 4. *The supervisor restarts it and the restart works.* Not "an instance ran": the replacement's

/// real authority, and a control that must fail.

///    checks every answer against its own independent computation of the digest. It has no code
///    path for "the server went away" because there is no such event to have one for.
/// 2. **The operator's witness**, a shared page in `swapper`'s address space that each instance
///    stamps with its own version per request. Read after every writer is dead, it says that no
///    request went unserved (nothing was lost in the down window) and that the version never goes
///    backwards (**there were never two owners of the device at once**, which is the whole reason
///    step 2 revokes).
/// 3. **The control that must fail**: the outgoing instance is told to read one UART register
///    *after* the operator revoked it. It faults, and the kernel's fault message carries the
///    device's own virtual address. Before the revoke the same read succeeded, which is what makes
///    this a receipt rather than a coincidence.
/// 4. **The attacker**, `chatty` in its usurper role, endowed with exactly the honest client's
///    capabilities including a real working capability to the stable endpoint. It tries to park
///    itself in `RECV_CAP` and become the server. `NotPermitted`: its capability carries `WRITE`
