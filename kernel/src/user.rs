//! Userspace. EL0. The actual operating system boundary.
//!
//! Everything before this was a Rust program that boots. From here on, the machine runs code
//! that **we did not compile and do not trust**, and the kernel's job stops being "do things"
//! and starts being "decide what is allowed."
//!
//! # Entering EL0 is returning from an exception that never happened
//!
//! There is no "drop to EL0" instruction. There is only `eret`, which restores whatever
//! `SPSR_EL1` says and jumps to `ELR_EL1`, and the exception level to return to is *in*
//! `SPSR_EL1`. So we do not need a new way down. We need a **fake way back**: fabricate a
//! [`TrapFrame`] with `SPSR = EL0t`, point `sp` at it, and fall into the `exception_restore`
//! that milestone 2 already wrote.
//!
//! This is the second time the project has pulled exactly this trick. `Thread::spawn` fakes a
//! `switch_to` frame so that the `ret` which *resumes* a thread also *starts* one
//! (notes/threads.md). Both times the "start" path turned out to be the "resume" path with a
//! forged frame, and no new code at all.
//!
//! # What milestone 4 already paid for
//!
//! The kernel lives entirely in `TTBR1`, at `0xffff_...`. Userspace lives in `TTBR0`, at
//! `0x0000_...`. **The hardware picks the table register from bits 63:48 of the address**, so:
//!
//! - The kernel is mapped in every address space, for free. Nobody had to copy anything.
//! - A syscall **does not switch page tables**. There is nothing to flush and nothing to remap.
//! - Installing a process is one `msr ttbr0_el1`.
//!
//! None of that was written for milestone 7. It fell out of a higher-half decision made three
//! milestones ago, and `Flags::user_code()` / `Flags::user_data()` have been sitting in the
//! `paging` crate, unused, waiting for today.
//!
//! # What is deliberately NOT here
//!
//! **A syscall ABI.** The user program below executes `svc #0` and asks for nothing. There is
//! no syscall number, no argument convention, no return value. DECISIONS §10 chose
//! capabilities, and the syscall surface gets designed against a capability table at 7d, in one
//! piece, on purpose. Not accreted here because it was convenient.

    // `sp - 16`, which put the frame at `sp - 304` while `trap.s` builds an S-mode trap frame at
    // `sp - 288`. The two differ by exactly 16 bytes, so the user frame's `x[2]` (the user `sp`)

    // trap's `scause` (whose UXL bits are 0, an illegal U-mode XLEN). When `t5` happened to be 0 the

///    code computed, so the crash is not something unrelated on the way there, which would make the
///    rest of the assertions vacuous.
/// 3. *Nothing outside the grant changed.* Two witness pages, both position-derived patterns
///    checked byte by byte through the confiner's own mappings. `WITNESS_RO` is the **same physical
///    frame** the component holds read-only, so an unchanged page is not "the store landed

/// 4. *The supervisor restarts it and the restart works.* Not "an instance ran": the replacement's
