//! GICv2: the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller.
//!
//! The thing that decides *which* interrupt you are taking, and whether you are allowed to
//! take it at all. The CPU only has one IRQ input line; the GIC is the multiplexer in front
//! of it, and everything a kernel wants from interrupts (priorities, masking individual
//! sources, routing to a particular core) lives here rather than in the CPU.
//!
//! # Two halves, and the split is the whole design
//!
//! | | Where | Shared? | What it does |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | **Distributor** (GICD) | `0x0800_0000` | one for the whole machine | decides *which core* gets an interrupt, and whether a given source is enabled at all |
//! | **CPU interface** (GICC) | `0x0801_0000` | one **per core** (banked) | the core's own view: acknowledge, set a priority mask, signal end-of-interrupt |
//!
//! One distributor, N CPU interfaces at the *same address* (the hardware banks the registers
//! per core). Which is what makes "route this interrupt to core 3" a thing the hardware can do
//! without the software knowing.
//!
//! # Three kinds of interrupt, and the numbering is not arbitrary
//!
//! | INTID | Kind | |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0-15 | **SGI**: Software Generated | one core kicking another. How SMP bringup and TLB shootdown work. |
//! | 16-31 | **PPI**: Private Peripheral | *per-core*. The timer is one of these, and it has to be: every core needs its own. |
//! | 32+ | **SPI**: Shared Peripheral | the UART, the disk. Any core may service them. |
//!
//! **The timer is a PPI (INTID 30) and that is not an accident.** A timer that fired on only
//! one core could not preempt threads on the others. Each core has its own timer, its own
//! countdown, and its own interrupt, all wearing the same number.
//!
//! # Priorities are backwards
//!
//! **Lower value = higher priority.** And `GICC_PMR` is a *mask*: an interrupt is delivered
//! only if its priority is **strictly less than** PMR. So `PMR = 0xff` means "let everything
//! through" and `PMR = 0` means "let nothing through".
//!
//! Get the comparison backwards and you get a machine that takes no interrupts and gives you
//! no clue why.
