//! NS16550 UART driver (RISC-V console).
//!
//! The other ancient, beautifully dumb serial port. Where aarch64's `virt` machine has a PL011,
//! RISC-V's has an NS16550 (a 16550-compatible 8250) at `0x1000_0000`. Same idea, different
//! register block: eight registers, and the transmit-ready flag lives in the Line Status Register
//! instead of a Flag Register.
//!
//! **The register block's shape is the board's, not the architecture's**, and since the
//! VisionFive 2 prep (notes/visionfive2.md) this driver carries it as data ([`Shape`]) instead of
//! assuming QEMU's. QEMU `virt` wires byte-wide registers at consecutive addresses; the JH7110's
//! UART0 is a Synopsys `DesignWare` `DW_apb_uart`, an 8250 whose registers sit **four bytes apart**
//! (`reg-shift = <2>`), want **32-bit accesses** (`reg-io-width = <4>`), and run from a **24 MHz**
//! clock, so the old byte read of LSR at offset 5 landed in the middle of the IER word and the
//! transmit poll would spin on garbage forever. The shape comes from the device tree
//! (`console::configure_from_dtb`); until that runs, [`Shape::QEMU_VIRT`] keeps the behavior this
//! driver always had, byte for byte.
//!
//! This one uses plain volatile access rather than `tock_registers` register blocks: the register
//! *indices* are what the 16550 defines, and the stride between them is a runtime value no static
//! layout macro can express. Named offsets and bit masks are clearer for a device this small.
//!
//! **The register block need not be in memory at all** (milestone 161). The same 16550 that QEMU's
//! RISC-V `virt` puts at physical `0x1000_0000` is, on every x86 machine including the OptiPlex
//! milestone 87 tracks, at **I/O port** `0x3f8`: a separate address space reached only by the `in`
//! and `out` instructions, with no page tables in front of it. That is a difference in how the
//! eight registers are *reached* and in nothing else, so it is a type parameter
//! ([`RegisterSpace`]) rather than a second driver. The parameter defaults to [`Mmio`], so every
//! existing use of `Ns16550` means exactly what it always did.
//!
//! Splitting the access out this way is also what keeps rule #1: `in`/`out` are instructions, so
//! the port-space implementation lives under `arch/x86_64/`, not here.
//!
//! Same rule as every driver here (DECISIONS.md §4): **it reaches into no globals.** It is
//! constructed with a base address and a shape and knows nothing else. It is the sibling of
//! `pl011.rs`, selected by the console at compile time. See notes/riscv-port.md.
