//! GICv3: the memory-mapped half, the distributor and one redistributor per core.
//!
//! Milestone 227. The GICv2 driver beside this one ([`super::gic`]) is the place to learn what a GIC
//! is; this file is what changes when the version does. Three things change, and only two of them
//! are here:
//!
//! | | GICv2 | GICv3 | where it lives |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | **Distributor** (GICD) | routes SPIs with an 8-bit CPU mask (`ITARGETSR`) | routes SPIs to an **affinity** (`IROUTER`), once `ARE` is set | here |
//! | **Per-core private state** (SGIs, PPIs) | banked inside the distributor | a **redistributor frame per core**, each at its own address | here |
//! | **CPU interface** (acknowledge, EOI, priority mask, send an SGI) | banked MMIO, `GICC_*` | **system registers**, `ICC_*` | `arch/aarch64/gic_cpu_interface.rs` |
//!
//! The split is DECISIONS §4 rule 1, and it is the reason there are two files rather than one:
//! `msr`/`mrs` are architecture code, so the CPU interface lives under `arch/`, while everything
//! reachable through a pointer stays a driver that is handed its addresses and knows nothing else.
//! `arch::irq` (the aarch64 adapter) is the one place that holds both and decides which version
//! this machine has. See design/roadmap/227-gicv3-driver.md for the placement and what lost.
//!
//! # What a redistributor is, and why each core must find its own
//!
//! GICv2 banked a core's private interrupts at one shared address: every core wrote `ISENABLER0`
//! and the hardware routed the write to that core's copy. GICv3 gives each core a **frame pair**:
//! `RD_base` (control, identity, power) and `SGI_base` 64 KiB above it (the enables, priorities and
//! groups for INTIDs 0-31). The frames sit end to end in the region the device tree names, and
//! **which frame is which core is written in the frame itself**, in `GICR_TYPER[63:32]` as an
//! affinity value. So a core finds its frame by walking the array and comparing, never by indexing
//! it with its own id; that is Linux's `gic_iterate_rdists` and `__gic_populate_rdist`, and this
//! walk is the same one.
//!
//! A frame pair is 128 KiB, or 256 KiB on a GICv4 part with virtual LPIs (`GICR_TYPER.VLPIS`), and
//! the last frame in a region says so (`GICR_TYPER.Last`).
//!
//! # Groups, and the one setting that decides whether anything arrives at all
//!
//! A GICv3 delivers an interrupt through the CPU interface only if the interrupt's **group** is
//! enabled there. This kernel runs at non-secure EL1 and enables Group 1 (`ICC_IGRPEN1_EL1`), so
//! every interrupt it uses is configured Group 1 (`IGROUPR` all ones), in the distributor for SPIs
//! and in each redistributor for SGIs and PPIs. Leave one Group 0 and it is signalled as an FIQ,
//! which this kernel does not take: the second way to build a GIC that boots and takes nothing.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! Distributor and redistributor writes are ordinary Device-nGnRE stores, which arrive in program
//! order at one device, so no barrier is needed between them. What is needed is **`RWP`**, "register
//! write pending": a write to `CTLR` or to a clear-enable register has taken effect only when that
//! bit reads zero (Arm IHI 0069, `GICD_CTLR.RWP` and `GICR_CTLR.RWP`; Linux
//! `gic_do_wait_for_rwp`). The driver waits on it after exactly the writes Linux waits after:
//! turning the distributor off and on, the redistributor's private-interrupt setup, and a disable.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **No ITS, no LPIs.** Message-signalled interrupts on a GICv3 go through a separate device (the
//!   ITS), which milestone 317 wants for interrupt remapping. Nothing here touches it, and under HVF
//!   QEMU offers a `GICv2m` frame instead of an ITS anyway.
//! - **No extended SPI or PPI ranges** (`GICD_TYPER.ESPI`, INTIDs 4096 up). No machine this kernel
//!   boots has them, and an INTID past 1019 is refused by [`enable`] rather than written somewhere.
//! - **No redistributor power-down.** A core that parks never puts its redistributor back to sleep
//!   (`GICR_WAKER.ProcessorSleep`); nothing in this kernel powers a core off.
//! - **The frame stride is inferred per frame from `VLPIS`**, as Linux does when the tree states no
//!   `redistributor-stride`. A board that pads its frames and states a stride would be misread; none
//!   this kernel meets does, and the walk fails loudly (no frame found) rather than silently.
//!
//! Name: provisional (`gicv3` for the module), and a lane's to propose: the version suffix is the
//! vocabulary Arm's own documents and Linux's `irq-gic-v3.c` use for exactly this split.
