//! **The JH7110's clock and reset generator, the volatile half** (milestone 220).
//!
//! `crates/jh7110_crg` owns the offsets, the bit positions, the bring-up plan and the device-tree
//! query, all of it host-tested and pointer-free. This file is the twenty lines that actually
//! store to a register, and it does nothing else: it walks a plan it is handed, against a base it
//! is handed, and reports what the hardware said.
//!
//! Same rule as every driver here (DECISIONS §4): **it reaches into no kernel global.** No base
//! address of its own, no static state, no idea which device it is bringing up.
//!
//! # Why this is in the kernel, when drivers here are EL0 processes
//!
//! DECISIONS §86 (whether an NVMe driver can leave the kernel, and what capability would let it)
//! names *"the microkernel thesis that drivers are user programs"* as this project's direction of
//! travel, so a kernel-resident driver is an exception and owes an argument. It is the same
//! argument §86 settled for NVMe on 2026-09-03, and reusing it beats inventing a second one: **the kernel keeps the admin
//! plane, EL0 gets the data path, and no new syscall surface is added.**
//!
//! Three things make the clock controller a stronger case for that split than NVMe was, not a
//! weaker one:
//!
//! - **It is a shared resource, and granting it would *widen* a driver's authority rather than
//!   confine it.** The STG window is one 64 KiB block holding the clocks and resets for USB,
//!   both PCIe root ports, the DMA engine and the security block. A userspace TRNG driver holding
//!   it could gate PCIe's clock or assert USB's reset. Milestone 159's whole demonstration is that
//!   the driver holds *one page of one device's registers and two endpoints*; handing it the CRG
//!   would trade the narrowest authority in this tree for the widest.
//! - **It is one-shot setup, entirely off any hot path.** Fatal risk 6's unmeasured half is "at
//!   real speed", and nothing about three register writes at wiring time is on that path. The
//!   performance argument that makes EL0 attractive for NVMe's data path does not exist here.
//! - **It costs zero new syscall surface**, which is the property §86 called the reversible part
//!   of its own decision. `start_jh7110` already maps the device page and spawns; this adds three
//!   stores before it. Nothing two programs agree on changes, so if a later milestone wants a
//!   clock service at EL0 (a power-management story would want one), that is a decision taken on
//!   its own evidence and not one this forecloses.
//!
//! # SAFETY, and the one rule that keeps it true
//!
//! [`bring_up`] stores to whatever address it is given. `STG_BASE`'s fallback in the pure crate
//! means a `Found` can name `0x1023_0000` on a machine that has nothing there, and a store to
//! unmapped MMIO on RISC-V is a fault or a hang. **So the caller must have established that this
//! machine is a JH7110 before calling**, and `memory::jh7110_crg` is where that is
//! established: it records a region only when the tree names either a CRG or a JH7110 TRNG, so
//! QEMU's `virt` board (which names neither) never produces one and this driver is never reached
//! there.
