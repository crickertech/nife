//! PLIC driver: the RISC-V Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (milestone 20).
//!
//! The RISC-V analog of the GIC. Where an aarch64 device raises an SPI into the GIC and the CPU
//! takes an IRQ exception, a RISC-V device raises a wire into the **PLIC**, which routes it to a
//! *context* (a hart at a privilege level) as a supervisor external interrupt (`scause` = 9). The
//! PLIC's job is priority arbitration and the claim/complete handshake; it does no masking of its
//! own beyond the per-context enable bits and threshold.
//!
//! The register model, all 32-bit MMIO at fixed offsets from the base (which comes from the device
//! tree, like the GIC's):
//!
//! ```text
//!   base + 0x0000 + 4*source          per-source priority (0 = never interrupt)
//!   base + 0x1000 + ...               per-source pending bits (read-only; we do not use them)
//!   base + 0x2000 + 0x80*context      per-context enable bits, one bit per source
//!   base + 0x20_0000 + 0x1000*context per-context priority threshold (interrupt if prio > threshold)
//!   base + 0x20_0004 + 0x1000*context per-context claim (read) / complete (write)
//! ```
//!
//! A *context* is a (hart, privilege) pair, and **the numbering is the board's**, read out of the
//! device tree's `interrupts-extended` by `arch::irq::init_contexts` (`isa::plic`). On QEMU's `virt`
//! S-mode is `2*hart + 1` (`2*hart` is M-mode, which OpenSBI owns); on the JH7110 the disabled S7
//! contributes only an M context and S-mode is `2*hart`. This driver is always handed a context
//! and never derives one, so the mapping lives in `arch::irq`, not here.
//!
//! Same rule as every driver here (DECISIONS §4): **it reaches into no kernel globals.** [`init`]
//! is handed the base address and the context; everything else works from the base it stored. (It
//! owns a lock, as `drivers/gic.rs` does, which is not a kernel global: it is this driver's own
//! state, and the rank constant is the only thing it borrows from above.)
//!
//! # Exactly one register in this map needs serializing, and it is not the hot one
//!
//! Audited register by register (finding 3 of notes/arch-audit.md):
//!
//! | Register | Shape | Serialized? |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | per-source priority | one 32-bit word **per source**, whole-word write of a constant | no: unshared |
//! | per-context enable bits | one word shared by **32 sources**, read-modify-write | **yes** |
//! | per-context threshold | one word per context, whole-word write of `0`, idempotent | no: not an RMW |
//! | per-context claim/complete | one word per context, read = claim, write = complete | no: hart-local |
//!
//! Only the enable word is a read-modify-write over state shared between callers, so only it takes
//! the lock. The claim/complete handshake stays lock-free on purpose: it is the external-interrupt
//! hot path, and it cannot race, because a context belongs to exactly one hart and the handler
//! claims and completes against its own context with interrupts masked throughout. It also does not
//! share a word with the enable bits (different 0x2000 and `0x20_0000` blocks), so serializing one
//! does not drag in the other.

    //! **What can and cannot be tested here, stated up front.**
    //!
    //! The bug this file's lock closes is a lost update between two MMIO accesses. It cannot be
    //! reproduced on demand: the window is two instructions wide, enables happen a handful of times
    //! per boot, and widening the window to catch it would mean shipping test-only code inside the
    //! critical section and then testing the instrumented version rather than the real one. A loop of
    //! two harts hammering the enable bits would pass with the lock and pass without it, so it would
    //! prove nothing. There is no test here that would have caught the bug, and pretending otherwise
    //! would be worse than saying so.
    //!
    //! What *is* tested is the half that a test can actually pin: the read-modify-write preserves the
    //! neighbours that share its word. That is precisely the invariant a lost update violates, so a
    //! regression in the RMW itself (an inverted flag, a wrong bit or word index, a `write` that
    //! forgets to `read` first) fails here deterministically. It is also the regression this change
    //! introduced the risk of, by folding `enable` and `disable` into one helper.
    //!
    //! The serialization itself is proved by the suite it runs inside rather than by an assertion:
    //! every riscv virtio test spawns a driver (which calls `enable` from thread context, interrupts
    //! on) and takes device interrupts (which call `disable` from the handler). If the rank were
    //! misplaced, §9's enforcement is an `assert!` in `IrqSafeMutex::lock` and the run would panic
    //! with LOCK ORDER VIOLATION; if the lock were not IRQ-safe, a handler would spin against a
    //! thread on its own hart and the run would hang. A green suite is a real statement about both.
