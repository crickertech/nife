//! PL011 UART driver.
//!
//! The serial port: ancient, and beautifully dumb. Write a byte to a magic address
//! and it goes out a wire, one bit at a time. It is the simplest way a computer can
//! say anything at all, which is why it is the first thing every kernel learns to
//! do. See notes/qemu.md.
//!
//! Note the rule from DECISIONS §4: **this driver reaches into no globals.** It
//! is constructed with a base address and knows nothing about the rest of the
//! kernel. Whoever owns it decides where it lives. (Compare NetBSD's `bus_space`,
//! notes/portability.md.)
