// The GIC interrupt-controller driver, aarch64's. Gated now (milestone 20): portable code names
// `arch::irq`, not `drivers::gic`, so the only things that reach the GIC are aarch64 arch code
// (exceptions, timer) and the aarch64 `arch::irq` adapter. RISC-V's analog is `plic`. This gating is
// the last of the HAL leaks closed: a new ISA is a new `arch/` directory, not a diff across the
// kernel (DECISIONS §4, §17). aarch64 IRQ tests in portable files stay `cfg(test)`, aarch64-only.

// than a memory address, which is a `RegisterSpace` in that driver rather than a second driver).
