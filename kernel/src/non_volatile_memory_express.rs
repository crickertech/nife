//! **The NVMe controller's admin plane** (milestone 53's storage half, narrowed to the admin half
//! by milestone 261; notes/non-volatile-memory-express.md, [DECISIONS §86](../../design/decisions/86-el0-nvme-driver.md)).
//!
//! What is left in the kernel after §86's **option 2a**, and the line is the one the hardware
//! already draws. Creating a queue names the physical address a ring lives at, in a PRP field of
//! an admin command; the admin rings' own bases are the `ASQ` and `ACQ` registers. **That is the
//! dangerous authority**, so it stays at EL1: reset the controller, build the admin pair by
//! register, enable it, IDENTIFY the namespace, and create the one I/O queue pair whose rings are
//! inside the region the IOMMU has already confined the device to. A process that never issues an
//! admin command and never touches those registers cannot choose where any ring lives, which is
//! what makes the geometry below a guarantee rather than an agreement.
//!
//! **The data path is gone from this file and runs at EL0.** Building a command, copying it into
//! the submission ring, ringing the doorbell and watching a completion's phase tag are
//! `components/src/non_volatile_memory_express.rs`'s now, over the same `crates/non_volatile_memory_express` arithmetic this module
//! computes with. The bring-up below is still a test of that machinery, because the admin queue
//! rides the identical ring discipline.
//!
//! Rule 2 shapes what is here exactly as it shaped the whole driver before: [`NonVolatileMemoryExpress`] takes the
//! register window's virtual base and one DMA region, passed in, and reaches for nothing else.
//! What reaches into the kernel is [`bring_up`], the policy function, which finds the controller
//! on the bus (`pci::find_nvme_device`), allocates the DMA region, and **confines the device to it
//! in hardware** before the controller is enabled: on all three `virt` machines the IOMMU denies an
//! unlisted requester id by default (milestone 16b), so a controller that has not been confined
//! cannot fetch its first command, and this bring-up is proof the confinement admits exactly what
//! it should.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-17 (calef, DECISIONS §154), performed 2026-09-18. Introduced 2026-08-15
//! with milestone 53's NVMe block driver as `nvme.rs`, the volatile half of the `nvme` crate, and
//! it takes its crate's name because that is what the pairing means: `pci` and `virtio` already
//! sit this way. The argument and the refusals are recorded once, beside the crate, in
//! `crates/non_volatile_memory_express`.
