//! **The instruction-count instrument** (milestone 78), a boot mode that asserts two timing claims
//! in a unit a busy host cannot move.
//!
//! *Provisional names throughout: the `icount` feature, this module, `tick_trace`, `script/icount`.
//! calef names crates, programs and modules (AGENTS.md); a lane ships a provisional one and says so.*
//!
//! # Why a separate boot mode rather than a wider margin
//!
//! Milestone 78 exists because assertions were failing on pull requests that changed no executable
//! code. Two of its claims survived every re-aiming the other rounds did, and they survived for the
//! same reason: **from inside the guest, a slow handler and a descheduled emulator are the same
//! observation.** `notes/load-sensitive-assertions.md` says so, and
//! `notes/load-sensitive-assertions/known-residuals.md` records the residual window that the miss
//! taxonomy narrowed rather than closed. The taxonomy itself was deleted on 2026-08-18, on both ISAs,
//! so that window no longer exists anywhere; this boot's instruction-denominated claim replaced it.
//!
//! Under `-icount shift=0,sleep=off` that confound does not exist. QEMU's virtual clock advances by
//! exactly **one nanosecond per guest instruction retired** and by nothing else, so the host
//! scheduler cannot move it at all. A claim denominated in instructions is therefore not
//! falsifiable by load, which is a different thing from a claim with a generous bound: it changes
//! what is measured rather than how loosely.
//!
//! # The claims
//!
//! 1. **The timer fired at the deadline the kernel armed.** On riscv64 this is the one this
//!    milestone could not previously make: SBI's `set_timer` is write-only, so `DEADLINE` is our own
//!    bookkeeping and nothing proved the firmware was armed with it. An implementation that
//!    maintained `DEADLINE` correctly and armed SBI with something else would pass every existing
//!    test. Here the arrival of each interrupt is compared against the deadline that fired, in
//!    instructions, and a divergence of any size shows up on the tick it happens.
//! 2. **The handler takes fewer than N instructions**, measured from the deadline to the moment the
//!    next one is armed. That span is exactly the quantity `MISSED_TICKS` is a coarse proxy for: a
//!    miss is that span exceeding a whole tick period. Bounding it directly is the assertion the
//!    missed-tick tests could not make.
//! 3. **Zero missed ticks**, which falls out for free and closes a recorded BUGS entry rather than
//!    adding a feature: **under this instrument a missed tick cannot be the emulator.** The taxonomy
//!    on both ISAs classified a miss by how late it was, and its cut left a window one tick period
//!    wide where a host deschedule was still called a slow handler. There are no deschedules in
//!    virtual time, so `missed_ticks() == 0` is assertable here with no taxonomy at all.
//! 4. **The re-arm law: the deadline advanced by exactly one interval per delivered tick.**
//!
//! # Claim 4 was added because this instrument could not see the drift bug (milestone 62)
//!
//! Claim 4 is the newest and it is here because **the first three do not subsume the suite's
//! `ticks_arrive_at_the_configured_rate`, and the record said they did.** Milestone 62's lane
//! injected the exact defect that test was written for on 2026-08-18, re-anchoring the grid from
//! `now` inside `rearm` (aarch64), and ran both instruments against it:
//!
//! | | verdict |
//! |---|---|
//! | `script/test --arch aarch64` | **red**, `timer drift: 20 ticks moved CNTV_CVAL_EL0 off the grid` |
//! | `script/icount --arch aarch64`, claims 1-3 | **green**, and every number byte-identical to a clean run: arrival min/mean/max 1008, handler 1056, `missed_ticks 0` |
//!
//! Byte-identical is the finding rather than merely green. Claim 1 compares the arrival against
//! **the deadline that fired**, so a kernel that re-anchors the whole grid arms the timer with the
//! same word it records and the comparison is satisfied on every tick, forever, while the delivered
//! rate falls to about 70 Hz. Nothing in claims 1-3 has a term that moves.
//!
//! So the law is asserted here too, and here it needs no retry loop: claim 3 has already established
//! that the window contains no miss, and a miss is the only thing that legitimately re-anchors the
//! grid. The suite's twin needs eight attempts to find such a window and on a loaded host sometimes
//! never does, which is the whole of milestone 62's disposition; on this instrument the window is
//! miss-free by assertion.
//!
//! # Why it is opt-in, and what that costs
//!
//! `-icount` is not a flag that observes; it changes what QEMU is. Two things about it are
//! disqualifying for a general test path, and **neither of them is speed**, which is worth saying
//! because the milestone block states the cost as "icount is slower and changes what the suite
//! measures" and the first half had never been measured. It is not slower on compute (2026-08-17: an
//! identical boot took 2.47-2.61 s under the instrument and 2.62-2.80 s without it, three runs
//! each). The second half is right, and is what the next two paragraphs are.
//!
//! It makes every vCPU share **one** virtual clock, so an idle hart parked in `wfi` jumps that clock
//! forward to the next event and multi-hart timing becomes fiction. That is why this boot and the
//! bench boot are both `-smp 1`, and why the placement probe can never move here
//! (notes/benchmarks.md). A suite run this way would silently stop proving every cross-core property
//! it exists to prove.
//!
//! And it makes a clock-bound wait cost instructions rather than host time: 0.64 s of virtual time
//! is 6.4x10^8 guest instructions, which this instrument spends about 3 s of wall clock retiring,
//! where a plain TCG guest reaches the same counter value in 0.64 s. The suite is full of such
//! waits.
//!
//! So the instrument is its own boot, its own feature and its own command, on the model
//! `script/bench` already set, and **nothing on the test path changes at all**: the `tick_trace`
//! hooks below are `#[cfg(feature = "icount")]`, so the test and shipping builds do not contain
//! them.
//!
//! The feature **implies `bench`** rather than standing alone, and kernel/Cargo.toml carries the
//! reason: both boots park at the same point, so both leave the same functions unreferenced, and
//! `bench` already spells that set out across five files. `script/bench`'s own binary is untouched
//! either way, which is the property that mattered.
//!
//! # What the numbers are
//!
//! Every quantity here is reported in **instructions**, converted from the counter the arch layer
//! already exposes: one counter tick is `1e9 / frequency()` nanoseconds and one nanosecond is one
//! instruction, so aarch64's 62.5 MHz counter reads in steps of 16 instructions and riscv64's
//! 10 MHz `rdtime` in steps of 100. That quantization is the instrument's resolution and it is
//! stated in the output rather than hidden, because it is what decides whether a given change is
//! visible here at all (see BUGS in notes/instruction-clock.md).
//!
//! The boot never exits on its own: it prints `icount: done` and parks in `wfi`, and `xtask icount`
//! owns the QEMU child and terminates it. Same contract as the bench boot, for the same reason.
