//! Stack overflow detection.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Milestone 3 hung the machine. A test put a 16 KiB array on the 64 KiB boot stack,
//! `sp` walked below `__stack_bottom`, and the frame wrote straight through `.bss`,
//! `.data`, and into `.text`. The kernel then executed its own corrupted code.
//!
//! There was no crash, no fault, no message. It hung *while printing*, and the print
//! had nothing to do with it. The bug was thousands of instructions upstream, in a
//! function prologue that had already returned.
//!
//! That is the worst failure mode this codebase can produce, and it was completely
//! invisible. So now it isn't.
//!
//! # What the real fix is
//!
//! A **guard page**: leave the page below the stack unmapped, and the MMU faults the
//! instant anything touches it. Precise, free at runtime, and impossible to miss.
//!
//! We can't do that yet, because we have no MMU. That's milestone 4, and the TODO is
//! recorded in link-aarch64.ld.
//!
//! Until then, a canary. It is strictly worse than a guard page: it detects the damage
//! *after* it has happened rather than preventing it, and only if the overflow actually
//! wrote over the canary words. But it turns "the machine went insane for no reason"
//! into "you blew the stack," which is the difference between an afternoon and five
//! seconds.

///
///   - a store through a stray pointer that happens to name a guard page, with `sp` nowhere near

///     8` are the first two words above a *different* stack's top, and a pointer that treats a
///     stack top as inclusive lands there rather than anywhere near `sp`.
///
/// So it now prints `sp` beside the faulting address in the same units and leaves the comparison
/// to the reader, rather than asserting the answer.
///
/// **The `sp` it prints is the interrupted one, taken from the trap frame**, and that is milestone
/// 124's correction to milestone 78's line. It used to read the live `sp` in the handler, "a few
/// frames deeper than the faulting context but on the same stack", and the second half of that
/// sentence stopped being true when a trap from kernel mode started running its handler on this
/// core's interrupt stack: the live reading would name a stack that has nothing to do with the
/// fault. Each ISA's fault path passes the value it already holds (aarch64 computes it from the
/// frame's own address, RISC-V reads the frame's saved `x2`), so the number is now exact rather
/// than close, which is a better report as well as a necessary one.
///
/// **One reading of "slot N-1" is a trap, and the printed guidance names it.** aarch64 has no
/// double fault: if the vector's own `SAVE_CONTEXT` store lands in a guard page it re-enters the
/// same vector with `sp` another 272 lower, repeatedly, until the frame fits, which puts it in the
/// slot below and leaves `FAR_EL1` holding the *first* failing address. That produces exactly the
