//! **The multi-tasking workload benchmark, and the thing that times it** (milestone 168).
//!
//! `design/decisions/96-process-kernel-or-event-kernel.md` has four inputs and three of them are
//! settled. The live one is performance, and the retrospective it rests on says exactly where the
//! difference lives: *"generally within 1% on micro-benchmarks but a 20% performance advantage of
//! the event kernel on a multitasking workload (AIM7)"* (Elphinstone and Heiser, *L4 Microkernels:
//! The Lessons from 20 Years of Research and Deployment*, ACM TOCS 34(1), April 2016, section 4.1,
//! read on 2026-09-04). Every instrument this tree owns is on the left of that sentence. This
//! module is the right of it.
//!
//! `crates/job_mix` is the workload's definition, and its header carries what AIM7 actually is,
//! which of its properties are kept and which of its 53 jobs are deliberately not.
//! `fixtures/src/job_mix_task.rs` is one task. This file is the supervisor: it builds the pool, releases a
//! subrun's worth of tasks, owns the wall clock, and prints.
//!
//! # The division of labour, and why it is the soak's and not the bench's
//!
//! `kernel/src/bench.rs` would have been the obvious home and is the wrong one, for a reason the
//! gate makes concrete: **this milestone's number has to be taken on radon**, and the bench boot
//! has never run on a board. The path a board takes is `script/board-image` plus
//! `script/board-console`, which is a kernel feature that prints to the serial console and a watcher
//! that reads it. So this is shaped like `kernel/src/soak.rs`: `--features job_mix`, the tour ends
//! here instead of halting, output is machine-readable lines on the console, and `script/job-mix` is
//! the QEMU rehearsal that proves the mechanism before anybody carries a card to a desk.
//!
//! It differs from the soak in the one way that matters: **a soak never ends and this one does.**
//! The sweep is finite, and when it is finished this prints [`job_mix::DONE`] and halts.
//!
//! # The pool is built once and released in slices, which is not how AIM7 does it
//!
//! AIM7 forks a fresh set of tasks per subrun. This spawns [`job_mix::MAX_TASKS`] processes once and
//! releases the first N of them per subrun, leaving the rest blocked on their own go endpoints.
//!
//! **Two reasons, and the second is a limitation rather than a design.** The honest one: a process
//! here costs an address space and a loaded image, and `spawn_el0` in `kernel/src/bench.rs` exists
//! to reclaim exactly one of those per iteration; spawning 63 across a sweep would measure the
//! memory-region allocator's fragmentation as much as the scheduler. The one to know: it means the
//! parked tasks' kernel stacks exist during every subrun even though nothing touches them. For the
//! quantity §96 asks about that is the right choice (the cost is in the stacks the machine *cycles
//! through*, and E1 measured the same way), but it is not a faithful reproduction of AIM7's own
//! subrun, and a reader comparing the two should know which is which.
//!
//! # Release skew, priced rather than hidden
//!
//! The supervisor hands out the go-ahead one rendezvous at a time, and a rendezvous is synchronous,
//! so task N starts N round trips after task 0. At the top of the sweep that is 32 sends of roughly
//! a microsecond against a subrun of tens of milliseconds, so it is under a part in a thousand. It
//! is not zero, and the alternative (a shared flag every parked task spins on) was refused: it would
//! have the tasks *not* in this subrun burning cores while the subrun ran, which would make the
//! sweep measure the pool size rather than N.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A number from one boot is a draw from a distribution, and on radon that distribution spans
//!   fifteenfold.** `notes/soak.md` records four runs on that board whose rates differ by that much,
//!   and milestone 240's census explains them: the rate tracks how the boot-time placement lottery
//!   landed. Nothing in this module fixes placement, because nothing in this kernel can. What it
//!   does instead is **print the census** ([`print_census`]) so a run's number is never quotable
//!   without the arrangement that produced it, and the bench procedure in `notes/job-mix.md` asks
//!   for repeated boots rather than one. **A single boot's jobs-per-minute figure is not a result.**
//! - **Each point is the median of [`job_mix::REPEATS`], and that is a decision about this
//!   workload rather than a house rule.** Until 2026-09-19 this kept the best of three, which is
//!   `kernel/src/bench.rs`'s `tp_best` methodology and is right on a shared dev Mac. On radon the
//!   spread between repeats is the tasks' own contention, not somebody else's load, and a best-of
//!   drawn from it moved 29% between boots at `tasks=4`. `job_mix::REPEATS` carries the evidence
//!   for 21 and the median. The fastest and slowest repeats are printed on the same line so the
//!   spread is never hidden, and every repeat still gets its own `job-mix-repeat:` line.
//! - **The breakdown exchange after each subrun is not free for the machine**, only for the clock.
//!   It is `JOB_KINDS` rendezvous per released task, after the clock stops and before the next
//!   subrun starts, so it warms the report endpoint and the supervisor's stack between repeats in a
//!   way the pre-2026-09-19 sweep did not. It is the same for every repeat and every point.
//! - **This does not compare a process kernel against an event kernel**, and it cannot: there is no
//!   event kernel to compare against. It measures what this kernel does under multi-tasking load,
//!   which is the input §96 says it is missing. §96 stays open either way.
//! - **The supervisor is a thread on the machine under test.** It is blocked in `RECV` for the whole
//!   of every timed window rather than spinning, so it is much less load than the soak's yielding
//!   watcher; it is not zero, and it is one more thread the scheduler holds.
//! - **The subrun's wall clock includes the tasks' own report sends.** The last of N tasks finishing
//!   is followed by N rendezvous the supervisor drains, and the clock stops after the last of them.
//!   That is deliberate (AIM7's subrun ends when every task has finished, and reporting completion
//!   is part of finishing) and it is a fixed additive cost that grows with N, so it flatters the
//!   small subruns by a few microseconds.

// **The seven markers in this import moved out of this file** (milestone 324 part 2): `CENSUS`,
// `DONE`, `FAILED`, `KIND`, `POINT`, `STARTED` and `SUBRUN`. They were private `const`s here and
// string literals in `xtask/src/main.rs`, agreeing with `crates/board_console`'s recogniser by a
// reader having checked; that is milestone 268's finding 3 wearing different clothes, and the fix
// is the one that milestone found. They now sit beside the rest of the workload's definition, which
// both halves of the instrument already read, and `crates/boot_ladder`'s header carries the general
// argument for why a printed line is a crate rather than a literal.
