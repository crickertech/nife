//! **The kernel proving it works on this machine, before it hands the machine to anybody.**
//!
//! Milestone 268's second rung. The boot ladder is: say what the machine is
//! ([`crate::print_machine_description`]), prove the kernel works on it (here), then hand over. All
//! three architectures climb the same ladder, and this module is the same code on all three: every
//! check below is portable, and the one place an architecture differs is
//! `arch::exceptions::self_test`, which each one already had to write anyway.
//!
//! # It reports, it does not gate
//!
//! calef, 2026-09-09: *"I could see building tools to diagnose what broke but we can only run them
//! if there is a prompt"*. A failing check prints its verdict and the boot carries on to userspace.
//! A machine you cannot log into is a machine you cannot fix, and a self-test that halted the boot
//! would take the diagnosis away at exactly the moment it is wanted.
//!
//! **So the verdict has to be read by something other than a person**, or milestone 268 ships its
//! own finding 4 back: a check that reports by printing a word and carrying on, with nothing
//! gating. `boot_ladder::SELF_TEST` is that contract. `crates/board_console` matches it, `cargo xtask
//! boot-check` boots all three architectures and fails on a red one, and CI runs that.
//!
//! # The verdict line is a contract, and its wording is provisional
//!
//! ```text
//! nife self-test: 5 of 5 passed
//! nife self-test: 4 of 5 passed, 1 FAILED: exceptions
//! ```
//!
//! Three properties, each of which is a lesson from something that already went wrong in this tree:
//!
//! - **The prefix is always present and identical on every architecture.** Milestone 268's finding
//!   3 is that `Stage::Tour`'s only matchable string lived inside the RISC-V arm of `main.rs`, so
//!   on the other two there was no signal on the channel at all, and a missing marker looks exactly
//!   like a slow board.
//! - **The counts print on success as well as on failure**, so "ran nothing and passed" is
//!   distinguishable from "ran the set and passed". A vacuous pass is the failure a gate acquires
//!   silently.
//! - **`FAILED:` is spelled the way this tree already spells it**, in `main.rs`'s preemption check
//!   (`FAILED: a spinner did not run, or nothing was preempted.`), rather than as a new word.
//!
//! The wording is **provisional** (milestone 268): a line two programs agree on is calef's under
//! AGENTS.md's *move fast on what can be undone* tenet, and the milestone block says a lane should
//! ship one and say so rather than wait. The other half of the contract is
//! `board_console::progress`, which is tested against this module's own constant rather than
//! against a remembered string.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Nothing here proves an architecture ran the set.** The verdict says five of five passed on a
//!   kernel that ran five checks; it cannot say that the *right* five ran, because the list is a
//!   compile-time fact and a check deleted from it takes its own evidence with it. The count is the
//!   partial defence (a shrunken set prints a smaller total), and `crates/board_console`'s tests
//!   pin the wording, but the set itself is guarded by review.
//! - **The set is cheap on purpose and therefore shallow.** Every check below completes in
//!   microseconds except [`fn@timer`], which waits about 20 ms for a tick. Nothing here spawns a
//!   process, touches a device, or exercises IPC, because this runs on every boot including a
//!   board's, and a boot self-test that cost a second would be turned off. The deep proofs are
//!   `script/test`'s suite; this is the subset that has to be true before a prompt is worth
//!   offering.
//! - **A check can still hang the boot if the operation it measures never returns.** The two
//!   waits here no longer can: both read the counter through [`Counter`], which reports a counter
//!   that has stopped rather than waiting on it, and [`fn@timer`] spins rather than sleeping, so a
//!   machine whose interrupts never arrive cannot park it either. What nothing here bounds is a
//!   `sched::yield_now` or an `mmu::map_page` that itself never comes back; that needs a watchdog
//!   on another core or on the timer interrupt, which this module deliberately does not own.
//!   (Before 2026-09-14 a stopped counter hung [`fn@timer`] forever, and `arch::timer::spin_for`
//!   still has that exposure.)

use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering};

// **The verdict's two fixed strings come from `crates/boot_ladder`**, not from literals here, so
// that this module and `crates/board_console` cannot hold two copies of one contract (`AGENTS.md`
// rule 7). Each carries its own trailing space, so a matcher that finds one has found a boundary
// rather than the start of a longer word.
