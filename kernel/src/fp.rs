//! **The floating-point and vector registers belong to one thread at a time.**
//!
//! The policy half of the per-architecture `arch::fp` modules, and the only thing that calls them.
//! Three ISAs, three completely different control registers, one rule:
//!
//! > **The FP/SIMD register file holds the running thread's data, or it holds
//! > [`FpState::INITIAL`]. It never holds a thread's data while a different thread runs.**
//!
//! Everything below is that sentence made true at the one instant it could stop being true, which
//! is the context switch. [`hand_over`] is called by the outgoing thread, on the outgoing thread's
//! stack, with interrupts masked and the scheduler's lock already released, immediately before
//! `arch::switch_to`. The switch itself is untouched: it still saves a calling convention's
//! callee-saved set and nothing else, and this runs beside it rather than inside it.
//!
//! # Why eager, and why the word "lazy" is a warning here
//!
//! The cheap-looking scheme is to leave the outgoing thread's registers in the hardware, trap when
//! the incoming thread touches them, and only then swap. It is cheap because a thread that never
//! touches FP never pays, and it is what several kernels did until 2018, when **LazyFP
//! (CVE-2018-3665)** showed that on x86 the trap is not a boundary: speculative execution past the
//! `#NM` reads the registers the trap was supposed to protect, and one thread recovers another's
//! AES round keys. The mechanism was `CR0.TS`, which is the very bit this tree's x86 half uses.
//!
//! So `CR0.TS`, `CPACR_EL1.FPEN` and `sstatus.FS` are used here to answer *"has this thread ever
//! wanted FP"*, which is a performance question, and never to answer *"whose data is in the
//! registers"*, which is a confidentiality one. The second question is answered by the registers
//! themselves always being right. That is what the `else` arm of [`hand_over`] is for: when the
//! outgoing thread had FP and the incoming one does not, the file is scrubbed to
//! [`FpState::INITIAL`] before the trap is re-armed, so there is nothing behind the trap to leak.
//!
//! # What it costs when nobody uses floating point, which is today
//!
//! Every userspace target in `targets/` is soft-float and the kernel is built `softfloat` too, so
//! no thread in this tree has ever executed an FP instruction. For those threads [`hand_over`] is
//! two loads and two predictable branches, and touches no control register at all: the expensive
//! half is behind `live`, and `live` is false. Milestone 447's block has the measured numbers.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **`live` never clears.** A thread that used FP once saves and restores 512 bytes on every
//!   switch for the rest of its life. RISC-V's `sstatus.FS` could answer the narrower question
//!   ("have the registers been written since they were loaded") in hardware and this does not use
//!   it, because a uniform rule across three ISAs was judged worth more than one ISA's optimisation
//!   while no workload exists to measure the difference on. When one does, that is the first thing
//!   to try.
//! - **A migrating thread carries its register file through memory.** The save happens on the core
//!   the thread is leaving and the restore on the core it arrives at, which is correct and is also
//!   a kilobyte of traffic that a same-core switch does not pay. Nothing measures it.
