//! **Fatal risk 6's bench boot** (milestone 261 (the NVMe driver leaves the kernel); design/fatal-risks.md risk 6,
//! notes/risk-6-bench-evening.md). Behind the `disk_throughput` feature, name provisional.
//!
//! The decisive experiment is "one real, non-virtio device on real silicon, confined, at
//! throughput", and on xenon two things have to be true on the night that no code can make true:
//! the VT-d unit this kernel programs must be the one that owns the NVMe's requester id, and the
//! namespace's LBA size must give `blocks_per` in `1..=8`. Either one failing used to arrive at the
//! bench as something that looked like a result: a throughput number from a device nothing was
//! translating, or a boot test that said "skipped". So this boot prints **both verdicts before it
//! measures anything**, then measures, then prints **one verdict line** whose first word cannot be
//! read as a pass unless both held.
//!
//! What it prints, in order, every line prefixed `disk-throughput:` so a photograph of the screen
//! and a serial capture are read the same way:
//!
//! 1. `preflight 1/2 dmar scope : PASS|FAIL`, with which unit owns the controller and how;
//! 2. `preflight 2/2 lba size   : PASS|FAIL`, with the LBA size and `blocks_per`;
//! 3. `ipc floor`, `write`, `flush` and `read`, each with its count and its time;
//! 4. `verdict CONFINED-AT-RATE | UNCONFINED | SKIPPED | FAILED`, and nothing after it.
//!
//! # What the numbers count
//!
//! The client is the kernel's boot thread, playing the part a client process would: every block is
//! one `CALL` across a rendezvous into the EL0 server, which builds one NVMe command, rings the
//! doorbell, polls the completion's phase tag, and replies. So a figure is **one command in flight,
//! 4096 bytes per command, polled, plus two context switches per block**. That is a lower bound on
//! the device and an honest measure of this driver; it is not comparable to `fio` at queue depth 32,
//! and the `ipc floor` line exists so the IPC share can be subtracted by whoever quotes it.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **It writes.** A window of [`WINDOW_BLOCKS`] blocks starting 1 MiB into the namespace is
//!   overwritten and read back. On xenon that disk was wiped on 2026-09-17 and holds nothing; on
//!   any other machine this build is a way to destroy data, which is why it is a feature no gate
//!   builds and why the verdict names the window it wrote.
//! - **The client is in the kernel**, so the figure leaves out the cost of a client that is itself
//!   a process. The server is the thing risk 6 is about, and it is the same process either way.
//! - **Sequential only**, one pass, no warm-up and no repeats. A second boot is the repeat.
