//! **Getting a screen on the two architectures whose firmware never gives one** (milestone 243).
//!
//! *Module name provisional (AGENTS.md: calef names modules).*
//!
//! Milestone 243 built the whole console-on-a-framebuffer path arch-neutrally and then wired it up
//! on `x86_64` alone, because `x86_64` is the only one of the three whose boot chain includes a
//! stage that has already lit a display. Its own block records the gap in one line: *"aarch64 and
//! riscv64 have no screen. `machine_discovery::framebuffer` and `screen_console` are arch-neutral
//! and unused there."* This module is the discovery half for those two, under the emulator.
//!
//! # Two halves, and only one of them is here
//!
//! - **On real boards**, the answer is milestone 157: U-Boot has already configured the DC8200 and
//!   advertises a `simple-framebuffer` node, and the kernel reads where it is. That is board work,
//!   it needs the board on the desk, and it stays in 157 rather than being half-done here.
//! - **Under QEMU**, there is no such stage, so nothing can be read. What `virt` offers instead is
//!   [`ramfb`](crate::drivers::ramfb), which inverts the arrangement: the guest provides the memory
//!   and the emulator scans it out. That is this module.
//!
//! Both halves end at the same call, `console::attach_screen`, with the same five-field
//! [`Framebuffer`]. So when 157 lands it adds a branch above this one and changes nothing below it.
//!
//! # Why the pixels are a static
//!
//! A `ramfb` needs a physically contiguous, permanently owned region, and it needs it **before the
//! frame allocator exists**: the whole value of a boot-tour console is that it is armed before the
//! tour, and `memory::init` is thirty lines into it. The frame allocator is also page-granular with
//! no contiguous multi-frame request, so 469 pages of aperture is not a thing it could serve.
//!
//! The cost is honest and is recorded in BUGS: [`SPAN`] bytes of `.bss` on every boot of both
//! architectures, including the board boots where `ramfb` does not exist and the region is never
//! touched.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! There is one caller, `kernel_main`'s boot tour, and the whole of it is:
//!
//! ```text
//! match screen::attach() {
//!     Ok((found, cols, rows)) => println!("  screen      : {}x{} ...", found.width, found.height),
//!     Err(why) => println!("  screen      : none ({why})"),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! To see it, ask QEMU for the device and for a monitor to photograph it through:
//!
//! ```text
//! qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -device ramfb -display none \
//!     -monitor unix:/tmp/mon,server,nowait -kernel target/.../nife.img
//! echo screendump /tmp/shot.ppm | nc -U /tmp/mon
//! ```
//!
//! `cargo xtask test --arch aarch64` does exactly that and decodes the result back into text with
//! `board_console::screen`, which is the gate that proves the glyphs and not merely the boot line.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **[`SPAN`] bytes of `.bss` are spent whether or not there is a screen.** On the VisionFive 2,
//!   where `ramfb` cannot exist, that is 1.9 MB of RAM this kernel zeroes at boot and never writes
//!   again. Milestone 157's handoff needs no buffer at all (U-Boot's aperture is already somewhere),
//!   so this cost belongs to the emulator's answer and not to the boards'.
//! - **The geometry is fixed at compile time.** `ramfb` will scan out whatever is asked for, so a
//!   larger screen is a constant away and a larger `.bss` with it. 800x600 is chosen to be the
//!   smallest thing that holds the boot tour without scrolling being the common case.
//! - **Nothing here runs on `x86_64`**, which has its own discovery in
//!   `arch::x86_64::machine::attach_screen` and a real aperture rather than guest RAM. The two do
//!   not share a code path and deliberately share a *type*.
