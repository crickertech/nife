//! The syscall boundary. **Four calls <!--count:syscalls-->.**
//!
//! DECISIONS.md §4 rule 3 said the syscall surface stays narrow and explicit, *"a boundary, not a
//! habit."* §8 said milestone 7 was a hard decision point and that hacking one in without the
//! conversation meant the plan had failed. §10 had the conversation and chose capabilities.
//!
//! This is what that buys:
//!
//! ```text
//!   exit(code)                          authority over yourself
//!   yield()                             likewise
//!   cap_delete(slot)                    likewise: your own cspace is your own
//!   invoke(cap, method, a0, a1, a2)     EVERYTHING ELSE
//! ```
//!
//! Three of the four are authority over yourself and the fourth is everything else, which is the
//! property worth remembering rather than the count. This header said "three calls" from
//! 2026-07-14 until the 2026-08-17 documentation sweep, `abi::SYS_CAP_DELETE` having arrived on
//! 2026-07-24 without it; the count is now a re-derived `<!--count:syscalls-->` claim.
//!
//! No `open`. No `read`. No `write`. No `fork`. **A process can only act on things it was
//! handed.** The ABI lives in `crates/abi`, which both the kernel and every user program depend
//! on, so the boundary is *one artifact* rather than two files that agree by luck.
//!
//! # No pointer ever crosses this boundary
//!
//! There used to be a `user_slice` here: the console `write` syscall took a `(ptr, len)` from
//! userspace and the kernel read the user's memory, which is why it needed the `AT S1E0R`
//! confused-deputy defence. Milestone 8 moved the console to a userspace server and deleted that
//! path. Today every argument is a scalar in a register (a capability slot, a method, a `va`, a
//! word), so the kernel follows no user pointer and there is no deputy to confuse. The primitive
//! that made the old check possible, `mmu::user_can_read`, is kept for the next syscall that does
//! take a user pointer.
