//! **The machine statistics page, the kernel's half** (milestone 126 (the `procps` package), DECISIONS §225 (`free` sees the machine and your share) part 2).
//!
//! One frame holding the machine-wide counters `free`, `vmstat` and `top` read: the free frame
//! count, and per core the busy and idle ticks, the context switches, the interrupts and the run
//! queue. The layout is `crates/machine_statistics_protocol`'s; this module is the writes.
//!
//! **The counters live in the page itself**, so there is no copy and no refresh to schedule. Each
//! per-core word is written only by its own core (the context switch, the tick and the
//! cross-core interrupt all run on the core they count), and each core's words are one cache line
//! of their own, so nothing here contends. The frame count is written under the allocator's own
//! lock, by whoever changed it.
//!
//! **Before [`publish`] the writes land in a static sink** rather than behind a branch: the page
//! pointer starts at the sink, so a context switch pays one load and one add whether or not the
//! page exists yet, and never a test. Nothing counted before `publish` reaches the page; `publish`
//! runs before the scheduler starts, so that is the boot path's own few switches at most.
//!
//! The capability to the page is minted once, for the progenitor, with `READ` and `GRANT`
//! (`kernel::user::boot_progenitor`). Nothing else in the system can name the frame.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - A counter written before [`publish`] is lost, by the design above.
//! - Interrupts are counted where they reach the scheduler: the tick, a cross-core poke and a
//!   device interrupt routed to a driver. A spurious or unrouted interrupt is not counted.
//! - The soak build's timer-driven `irq_notify` counts as a device interrupt, because it takes the
//!   same path on purpose (`kernel/src/soak.rs`).
//!
//! Name: provisional, minted 2026-09-26 by milestone 126's `free` lane.
