//! **The NVMe block driver's volatile half** (milestone 53's storage half; notes/nvme.md).
//!
//! Everything an NVMe driver *touches*, over the arithmetic `crates/nvme` computes: volatile
//! register reads and writes into the controller's BAR0, command copies into the queue memory,
//! doorbell rings, and the polling loop that watches a completion's phase tag. The split is the
//! `pci` module's exactly, and rule 2 shapes the driver itself: [`Nvme`] takes the register
//! window's virtual base and one DMA region, passed in, and reaches for nothing else. What does
//! reach into the kernel is [`bring_up`], the policy function, which is what finds the controller
//! on the bus (`pci::find_nvme_device`), allocates the DMA region, and **confines the device to it
//! in hardware** before the controller is enabled: on both `virt` boards the IOMMU denies an
//! unlisted requester id by default (milestone 16b), so a controller that has not been confined
//! cannot fetch its first command, and this driver's bring-up is proof the confinement admits
//! exactly what it should.
//!
//! **Kernel-resident, and that is a recorded limitation rather than the design** (notes/nvme.md's
//! BUGS). The virtio drivers run at EL0 behind a `Virtio` capability whose kernel half validates
//! every queue address; NVMe has no such capability, and inventing one is new syscall surface,
//! which is a design fork (§10, §16) this milestone does not take. Until it is decided, the driver
//! serves the same block interface the FS server's block servers speak, one 4096-byte filesystem
//! block per transfer ([`fs_proto::blk`]'s unit), from kernel context.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded. Introduced 2026-08-15 with milestone 53's NVMe block driver, as the volatile
//! half of the `nvme` crate, the crate/module pairing `pci` and `virtio` already use. Provisional,
//! awaiting ratification with the crate's name.
