//! **How deep one IPC reaches into a thread's kernel stack** (milestone 134, 2026-09-19).
//!
//! Milestone 134's E1 predicts a knee in IPC latency against thread count from one piece of
//! arithmetic: thread kernel stacks sit `STACK_SLOT_SPAN` apart, each IPC touches a different one,
//! and "taking one IPC to touch roughly 1 to 2 KiB of its own kernel stack" they fill a 32 KB L1d
//! somewhere between 16 and 32 threads. That 1 to 2 KiB was an estimate. notes/stack-high-water.md
//! reports the deepest standing path across the whole suite, which is spawn and teardown rather than
//! IPC, so nothing measured the per-IPC figure. This does.
//!
//! # The method
//!
//! The same watermark as milestone 84 (stack high-water), through its `crate::stack::paint` and
//! `crate::stack::high_water`, re-armed **once per operation** instead of once per stack. Immediately before one IPC operation
//! the thread paints its own kernel stack from the bottom up to [`MARGIN`] bytes below its live `sp`;
//! immediately after, it scans for the deepest word that is no longer paint. The result is the
//! deepest byte that one operation reached, as a distance from the stack's top. Many operations,
//! many samples, and the report gives the minimum, the median and the maximum.
//!
//! Two shapes, each measured two ways:
//!
//! - **Kernel threads** ([`kernel_thread_shapes`]), which is E1's own shape: `bench.rs`'s
//!   `ipc_thread_scaling` runs kernel-thread pairs through `sched::ipc_send`/`ipc_recv`, and
//!   `call_reply` runs `ipc_call` against `ipc_recv_cap`/`ipc_reply`. The thread wraps each call in
//!   [`measured`], so the sample is that one call.
//! - **EL0 threads** ([`el0_shapes`]), which is the shape every real service runs. A user thread
//!   cannot paint its kernel stack, so the kernel does it for a registered thread at the end of every
//!   syscall ([`after_syscall`], called from `syscall::dispatch`): scan what the syscall that is
//!   ending reached, then paint for the next one. An EL0 thread's trap frame sits at the very top of
//!   its kernel stack (`sched::current_kernel_stack_top`'s note), so here the distance from the top
//!   is exactly the stack one syscall touches, trap frame included.
//!
//! # What the instrument costs, and why it does not perturb what it reads
//!
//! **Nothing in a default build**: all of this, including the one call in `syscall::dispatch`, is
//! `any(test, feature = "ipc_stack_depth")`. `script/fastpath-footprint`, `script/bench` and the
//! icount tripwire build neither. In a test build every syscall pays one relaxed load of
//! [`EL0_ARMED`] and returns.
//!
//! **In the path it measures, nothing below the paint.** Painting and scanning are done by the
//! measuring thread in its own frames, which sit *above* the painted ceiling; the operation then runs
//! below them. The one frame that is counted and is not the kernel's is the closure [`measured`] calls
//! (kernel shapes only), a few dozen bytes, and the report prints each series' caller offset so the
//! excursion below the call site can be read directly. What the instrument does cost is time (a
//! paint of up to 24 KiB per sample), which is why it is off in every build that measures time, and
//! why sampling stops once each series is full.
//!
//! # What it does not capture
//!
//! - **Interrupt nesting at the deepest instant.** A timer interrupt taken while an operation is at
//!   its deepest adds a trap frame to that sample (the handler itself runs on the interrupt stack
//!   when the trap is from the kernel; from EL0 it runs on this stack, before the next syscall). Those
//!   samples are the long tail, which is why the **median** is the per-IPC figure and the maximum is
//!   reported beside it as the interrupt-contaminated bound, not as the IPC's depth.
//! - **Real hardware.** Depth is decided by which calls run, not by timing, so QEMU measures it
//!   honestly (notes/stack-high-water.md, "Why the numbers are host-load-immune"), and this is not a
//!   timing number. What differs on silicon is codegen only if the build differs: the release kernel
//!   radon boots and the debug kernel `script/test` boots are different programs, and both are
//!   measured (see notes/stack-high-water.md for which is which).
//! - **Which lines are cache-hot.** A depth says how many bytes one operation *can* touch; it does not
//!   say they are all touched, or that they miss. That is M7's question in milestone 134's tier B.
//! - **Placement.** Under `script/test` the machine has four cores and the two ends may land on
//!   different ones, so a sample can come from the cross-core wake path or the same-core one. Both
//!   ends are spawned on the caller's core, and the report's spread says whether it mattered.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 134's lane, 2026-09-19): module, feature and the `ipc-stack-depth:`
//! line prefix alike. Names are calef's.
