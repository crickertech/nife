//! Microbenchmarks over the paths a microkernel lives on (milestone 21).
//!
//! Compiled in only by `--features bench` (`script/bench`); the bench boot diverges here before
//! the milestone tour, runs each benchmark in a fixed order, prints machine-readable lines, and
//! **halts**. It never semihosts: under HVF the semihosting `hlt` traps to the guest instead of
//! exiting (see xtask's `test()`), so the contract is output-based in both modes: `xtask bench`
//! owns the QEMU process, watches for `bench: done`, and terminates it. One exit mechanism,
//! accelerator-independent.
//!
//! # The two instruments (design/roadmap/21-benchmarks.md)
//!
//! - **icount (default):** QEMU virtual time is a deterministic function of instructions
//!   executed, so these counter deltas are *exact and reproducible per binary*: the same kernel
//!   prints the same numbers every run. But they are NOT stable across *different* binaries: adding
//!   unrelated live code shifts even untouched benchmarks by several percent, non-uniformly, because
//!   the compiler remakes whole-crate inlining and monomorphization decisions (notes/benchmarks.md
//!   has the measurement). So `bench/baseline-aarch64.txt` + `--check` is a **coarse tripwire** (10%) for a
//!   gross regression, not a fine attributor. Magnitudes are fiction anyway (TCG models no caches);
//!   the `--real` medians are the fine signal.
//! - **HVF (`--real`):** the kernel runs natively on the host core; real caches, real TLBs, the
//!   hardware counter at its real frequency. Magnitudes are true, determinism is gone (a shared
//!   desktop machine underneath), so real runs report and never gate.
//!
//! # Reading the numbers
//!
//! Each line is `bench: <name> <counter_ticks> <iters>`. The counter is `CNTVCT_EL0` at
//! `CNTFRQ_EL0` Hz (printed first), so ns/iter = ticks * 1e9 / freq / iters; xtask does the
//! division. Warmup iterations run untimed before each measurement so thread spawn and first
//! rendezvous costs land outside the window.

/// does a DMA transfer and waits on the disk's completion interrupt, roughly 200 us per block under
/// HVF. That swamps the FS server's own IPC-contract tax, which `relay_rtt` puts at a few hundred
/// *nanoseconds*. So this is the honest whole-path cost of a userspace file read, not an isolated
/// server tax, which is exactly the case milestone 21's rule names: when device latency swamps the
/// isolation, measure the whole path and say so rather than report a fictional isolated number.
///
/// The isolated file-server cost was attempted and abandoned, and this comment used to describe that

/// the device noise. The per-hop tax lives in `relay_rtt`, where it is measurable and gated.

// --- Multi-hart aggregate throughput (DECISIONS §28, the SMP placement win) ---
//
// Every primitive above is hart-pinned by design: the icount instrument boots `-smp 1` (the
// 2026-07-28 attribution finding, notes/benchmarks.md), so those numbers are per-core path length
// and cannot show §28's placement work at all. This one is different, and its methodology has to be
// different, so it is set apart here on purpose.
//
// It runs N independent ping-pong pipelines and measures the WALL-CLOCK time to complete them. A
// single pipeline is a synchronous rendezvous: only one of its two threads is runnable at a time,
// so it keeps ~one core busy and §28's local-wake rule keeps the pair co-located and warm. N
// independent pipelines are N such streams, which §28's power-of-two placement scatters across the
// cores at spawn. So the aggregate throughput of N pipelines should approach `online_count()` times
// a single pipeline's throughput: the whole machine filled, which is the property §28 exists to
// deliver and the one no hart-pinned primitive can see.
//
// **Why it is NOT on the icount baseline, and never gates.** Two reasons, both structural:
//   1. It is meaningful only with more than one hart. The icount instrument pins `-smp 1`, and so
//      does the default `--real` run (per-core magnitudes; see xtask's `bench`), so it runs ONLY on
//      the `--real --smp` boot (HVF, 4 harts), which the harness already forbids from
//      `--check`/`--save`. Everywhere else `online_count()` is 1 and it is skipped outright, so it
//      never touches `bench/baseline-aarch64.txt`.
//   2. Under `-icount` all vCPUs share one virtual clock (again the 2026-07-28 finding), so a
//      wall-clock throughput number is not even defined there; and TCG serialises vCPUs onto one
//      host thread, so there is no real parallelism to measure. Only HVF gives each core its own
//      counter and real concurrent execution.
//
// So this is a statistical `--real` measurement read by a human with loose bounds, exactly like the
// other HVF magnitudes, not a deterministic tick baseline. It reports two lines, `smp_pipe_solo`
// (one pipeline) and `smp_pipe_all` (N pipelines); the scaling factor is the solo ns/iter divided
// by the all ns/iter, and it should land near `online_count()`.
//
// **A methodology note about the solo baseline, learned by getting it wrong first.** The whole
// result is only as honest as its single-core reference, and the obvious way to take it is a trap.
// The main thread must **block** (a real `RECV`) while a batch runs, exactly as `ipc_rtt` above does,
// NOT busy-yield waiting on a counter. A yield-spinning main stays runnable, so on the solo batch
// the scheduler sees main plus the pair (three runnable-ish threads) and scatters them, turning each
// local rendezvous into a cross-core wake; the solo pair then clocked ~60x slower than `ipc_rtt`'s
// identical pair and the derived scaling went *superlinear* (>cores), which is not physical. With
// main blocked, the solo pair co-locates and runs at the `ipc_rtt` rate, and scaling lands at or
// below `cores`, as it must. Each batch is also run a few times and the **minimum** ticks kept: on a
// shared desktop under HVF the host preempts guest vCPUs, and the min is the least-contended sample,
// the closest thing to the true rate. Loose bounds, read by a human.
