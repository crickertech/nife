//! Bringing the other cores online (SMP steps 2 and 3b, DECISIONS.md §11).
//!
//! Core 0 starts each secondary with a PSCI `CPU_ON`, handing it a physical entry point
//! (`secondary_boot` in boot.s) and its own stack. The secondary replays the MMU-enable and lands
//! in [`secondary_main`].
//!
//! **Step 2** brought a core up "alive and idle" (bring-up path only). **Step 3b-ii** makes it a
//! full scheduler participant: it adopts the kernel's fine map, becomes its own idle thread with
//! its own run queue, brings up its GIC CPU interface and timer, and from then on schedules and is
//! preempted like the boot core.
//!
//! **Step 3c** adds cross-core placement. A core's run queue is single-owner, so to give it a
//! thread another core hands it through this core's **inbox** (the one cross-core scheduler
//! structure) and fires the reschedule SGI; the target drains its inbox into its own queue in the
//! handler. `sched::spawn_on(core, f)` is the primitive.
//!
//! **Load balancing** is the last piece, and since DECISIONS §28 it lives in `sched::spawn` itself:
//! two random choices at spawn, then work stealing by idle cores. There used to be an explicit
//! `spawn_balanced` that round-robined placement, and milestone 41 deleted it, because §28 left it
//! with no caller and a doc comment claiming a test used it that had already moved to plain `spawn`.

///   (milestone 100, reshaped by the by-id seating, 2026-08-14). The kernel indexes hardware by
///   logical id everywhere: `cpu::PERCPU`, the secondary stacks and the RISC-V trap stashes are
///   arrays indexed by it; the GICv2 targets an SPI by CPU-interface number and `send_sgi` by that
///   same number; the PLIC's S-mode context table (`arch::irq`) is indexed by hart id and the SBI
///   IPI mask is a bitmap of hart ids. Giving a core a logical id other than its hardware id would
///   need every one of those to translate, so [`read_cpu_list`] seats each core at the slot its
///   hardware id names and the equation holds by construction. The refusal that used to live here
///   (a positional slot whose recorded hwid was not its index) is now the seating's: a core whose
///   id is at or past `MAX_CPUS`, which includes every id on a clustered aarch64 board
///   (`MPIDR_EL1.Aff1` in use), gets a named line at roster time and stays parked. A machine whose
///   ids are sparse but small (say harts {0, 2}) now simply works, seats {0, 2}, where the
///   positional roster refused it; nothing between the ids is started or counted.
///
///   What that entanglement no longer includes, since the first-silicon sweep (2026-08-14): the
///   assumption that the online *logical ids* are contiguous from zero. Every per-cpu loop, both
///   IRQ-affinity round-robins and the spawn/wake placement now go through [`online_cpus`] /
///   [`nth_online`] (or mask with [`online_harts_mask`], as the RISC-V RFENCE calls do), so a
///   machine whose online set is {1,2,3,4}, the VisionFive 2 with all four U74s seated, is
///   handled (notes/visionfive2.md).
/// - **The conduit half is proved by parsing and not by calling.** `crates/machine_discovery`'s host tests read a
