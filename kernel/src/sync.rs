//! The kernel's lock.
//!
//! # The deadlock this exists to prevent
//!
//! A plain spinlock in a kernel that takes interrupts is a hang waiting for a schedule.
//! On **one core**:
//!
//! ```text
//!   kernel code:  ALLOCATOR.lock()   <- acquired
//!                 ...working...
//!        TIMER INTERRUPT
//!   handler:      ALLOCATOR.lock()   <- spins
//!                                       spins waiting for a lock that only the code it
//!                                       interrupted can release, and that code cannot
//!                                       run until the handler returns.
//!                                       Dead. Permanently. On one core.
//! ```
//!
//! This is not a race. It is a **guaranteed** hang the moment the timing lines up, and it
//! looks exactly like the mystery we lost two hours to in milestone 3.
//!
//! The fix: **mask interrupts for as long as the lock is held.** The interrupt cannot fire,
//! so it cannot try to take the lock. This is Linux's `spin_lock_irqsave`.
//!
//! # Two orderings that are the entire point
//!
//! **Acquire: mask interrupts FIRST, then take the lock.** The other order leaves a window
//! where we hold the lock with interrupts still enabled, which is precisely the deadlock.
//!
//! **Release: drop the lock FIRST, then restore interrupts.** The other order leaves a
//! window where interrupts are live and we still hold the lock. Same deadlock, arrived at
//! from the other side.
//!
//! Both windows are one or two instructions wide. Both are fatal. Both are the kind of bug
//! that works fine in testing for months.
//!
//! # Restore, do not enable
//!
//! [`IrqSafeGuard`] restores the interrupt state that was in effect when the lock was
//! taken. It does **not** simply enable interrupts on release.
//!
//! The difference matters when a lock is taken inside a context that already had interrupts
//! masked (an interrupt handler, or an outer lock). Blindly enabling on release would unmask
//! interrupts *inside an interrupt handler*, and the resulting fault is one you will not
//! enjoy explaining. This is why Linux's is called `irqsave`/`irqrestore`.
//!

/// # Lock ranking: the rule from DECISIONS.md §9, enforced by the machine
///
/// > Two locks? Define a global order and always take them in it. Otherwise **AB-BA
/// > deadlock**, which is a *real* race and far nastier than the interrupt deadlock this
/// > type's other half prevents.
///
/// We wrote that rule and then relied on discipline, which is to say on remembering. Now
/// every lock carries a **rank**, and the rule is:
///
/// > **You may only acquire a lock strictly LOWER than everything you currently hold.**
///
/// If every acquisition strictly decreases the rank, a cycle is **unrepresentable**. Not
/// unlikely. Impossible. That is why this is *prevention* and not *detection*: it kills the
/// circular-wait condition outright ([notes/deadlock.md](../notes/deadlock.md)), rather than
/// building a graph and hunting for cycles the way Linux's `lockdep` does.
///
/// FreeBSD (WITNESS) and Solaris use the same mechanism, for the same reason: it costs three
/// instructions and it cannot be wrong.
///
/// ## The hierarchy

///   61  ASPACES         user-built address spaces
///        |
///   60  IPC_TABLES      the thread table and endpoints
///        |
///   59  INBOX, MAPPINGS, KMEM   inboxes; the revocation registry; the kernel object budget
///        |

///   55  STACK_VA        free thread-stack addresses
///        |
///   30  FRAMES, RAM     the physical memory map
///        |
///   20  IRQ_CONTROLLER  the interrupt controller (the GIC, or the PLIC)
///        |
///   10  CONSOLE         the leaf: everyone may take it, it takes nothing
/// ```
///
/// (The allocators' ranks, HEAP and SLAB at 50, left with the allocators: milestone 14 removed
/// the kernel heap, and a lock that no longer exists needs no place in the order.)
///
/// Two locks at the **same** rank may never be nested (`R < R` is false), which is exactly
/// right: equal rank means we have declared no order between them, so nesting them would be
/// choosing one at random.
///
/// The nestings this permits, and they are the ones that actually happen:
///
/// - **MAPPINGS (59) → UNTYPED (58)**: recording a mapping retypes a log page from the paying
///   process's own region, while holding the registry lock (milestone 14 phase C).
/// - **anything → CONSOLE (10)**: a panic prints while holding a lock. Which is why the
///   console must be the leaf, and why it takes nothing itself.
///
/// ## A design this would have caught
///
/// `memory::ram_regions()` used to be an iterator that held the RAM lock while the caller
/// iterated. `mmu::map_everything` iterates it *and allocates frames inside the loop*, so it
/// would have held RAM (30) while taking FRAMES (30), and `30 < 30` is false. The ranking
