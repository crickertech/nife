//! Per-CPU state.
//!
//! Each core reaches its own private data in a single instruction, through a pointer the
//! architecture keeps in a scratch register for exactly this purpose (`TPIDR_EL1` on aarch64;
//! see [`crate::arch::set_percpu`]). This is the foundation the rest of SMP is built on: once a
//! core can name "my own state" cheaply, the scheduler's run queue, its current thread, and its
//! lock bookkeeping can each stop being a single machine-wide global. See DECISIONS.md §11.
//!
//! **Step 1 of §11.** For now the only thing that lives here is the lock-rank bookkeeping §9
//! keeps, which used to be one global (`HELD_RANK`) and would be clobbered the instant a second
//! core took a lock. Moving it here changes nothing on one core and is the smallest provable
//! piece of the per-CPU machinery. The block grows in step 3 to hold this core's run queue,
//! `current`, idle thread, reschedule flag, and migration inbox.
