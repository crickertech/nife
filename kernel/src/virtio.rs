//! virtio-mmio **enumeration**. Not a driver.
//!
//! This module reads the standardized identity registers of each virtio-mmio slot to find the
//! block device and route it to a userspace driver. It does not set up a queue, negotiate a
//! feature, or move a byte of data. That is all the driver's job, at EL0 (see the `virtio_blk`
//! role in user/src/hello.rs).
//!
//! **Why this much lives in the kernel.** Discovering which device is in which slot is bus
//! enumeration, the way firmware walks PCI: you read a device-independent ID register and hand
//! the device to whatever driver claims that ID. It is a bootstrap role, not device operation,
//! and it is the smallest amount of virtio knowledge that lets the kernel say "the block device
//! is in slot 3, its interrupt is INTID 51" without knowing the first thing about how a block
//! device works.

// Milestone: DMA confinement. The kernel owns the block device's transport.
//
// The device does DMA against raw physical addresses with no IOMMU in front of it, so page-table
// permissions do not apply to it. If a userspace driver could program the queue and ring the
// device itself, it could point the device at any physical address (the kernel, another process)
// and the device would read or write it. So the kernel keeps the two DMA-critical powers: the
// queue's ring addresses and the "go" signal, and **validates that every address the device
// will touch lies within the driver's own DMA region** before letting it proceed. The driver
// still builds its own requests in its own region and reads its own results; it simply cannot
// aim the device anywhere else.
//
// This is the software stand-in for an IOMMU. It is not generic (it understands the virtqueue
// *transport*: the descriptor table and the available ring), but it knows nothing about block
// devices: the request format, sectors, and results stay in the userspace driver.

/// number's history keeps earning: the honest fix is releasing a transport when its driver dies,
/// which is its own piece of work because nothing here unregisters. The same suggestion DECISIONS
/// §33 made about `KERNEL_EP_PAGES`, for the same reason.
///
/// **27 for milestone 37**, whose crash test brings up a block server on a disk of its own so that
/// deliberately leaving a filesystem half-written cannot touch the image every other FS test reads.
/// One more transport for the boot, and the same standing suggestion: this is the fourth bump, and
/// each one is a receipt for the missing unregister.
///
/// **29 for milestone 56's entropy service**, one transport per bus. This bump is the cheapest of
/// the five and the most annoying, because the entropy service is wired **once per device per boot**
/// (`entropy_service::ensure`) precisely so that a second one cannot reset the device under the
/// first, and it still costs two slots that are never released. The fifth receipt.
///
/// **30 for milestone 57's disk surveyor**, which brings up a block server on a fourth disk (the
/// GPT-partitioned image) so that reading a partition table cannot disturb any filesystem test. The
/// sixth receipt, and by now the pattern is not a coincidence: every milestone that wires one more
/// confined device costs a slot forever, because a transport is never unregistered. The fix is an
/// unregister on process death, not a seventh bump.
///
/// **31 for milestone 57's write half, which is the seventh bump the line above told it not to
/// take.** It is recorded that way on purpose. The fifth disk is a blank image the guest partitions
/// and formats, and it needs a block server of its own for the reason every other one does; what it
/// does not need is a slot held until reboot by a process that has been dead for minutes.
///
/// **Why this lane took the bump anyway**, since the alternative was named and refused: the
/// unregister is not a bookkeeping change. It has to decide what a `Virtio` capability *is* when its
/// holder dies (revoked, or dangling at a slot that has been reused), whether a transport can be
/// handed to a second driver at all after the first programmed the device, and how that interacts
/// with `entropy_service::ensure`'s "one service per device per boot" rule, which exists precisely
/// because re-driving a live device breaks the first driver. That is a lifetime decision about a
/// kernel object, which DECISIONS §16 says is a design fork rather than a task, so a lane that was
/// asked to partition a disk should not settle it in passing. Seventh receipt.
///
/// **32 for milestone 107's inbound half**, whose gate spawns one more `net_stack` over the mmio
/// NIC so a host process can connect to the guest. Eighth receipt, and the number is exact: 31 was
/// **precisely** the ceiling this boot already stood at, which is the clearest evidence yet that
/// this constant tracks "how many devices has this boot ever wired" rather than "how many exist".
/// The aarch64 machine has five.
///
/// **It was 33 for an hour, and the machine said no**, which is the honest half of this note. That
/// lane wanted two gates, one for the guest being connected to and one for the listen grant, and
/// wrote here that merging tests to fit a table is the table deciding what gets proved. Then the
/// suite ran: the second `net_stack` costs a 192-page untyped region nothing ever reclaims, and a
/// later test asking for 128 contiguous pages found **137 free frames and no run that long**. The
/// two claims now share one exchange with distinct stage codes. So the constraint was never this
/// table; it is the same missing reclamation, one resource over, and it binds harder there.
///
/// **The memory half was fixed on 2026-08-16 and this counter was not**, which is worth saying
/// plainly rather than letting the eight receipts above read as settled. A net service now hands its
/// frames back (notes/frames.md), so the *frame* ceiling those receipts describe is gone; this table
/// still bumps `count` and never reuses a slot, so a boot's device budget is still "how many devices
/// has this boot ever wired" and the aarch64 machine still has five. Reuse needs a **generational
/// name** here, the same machinery region slots and Tids already use, because a stale
/// `Object::Virtio` capability must not resolve to a different device than the one it named. That is
/// a change to what a capability means, not to a counter, so it is its own piece of work.
///
/// **33 for milestone 64's `std::net::TcpListener` gate**, which spawns one more `net_stack` over
/// the mmio NIC so that a std program with a listen grant and one without are two different
/// programs rather than two branches of one. Ninth receipt, and it is the first one taken **after**
/// the paragraph above, which is what makes it worth reading rather than another tally mark.
///
/// The eighth receipt records 33 being tried and refused an hour later, and the refusal was on
/// **memory** grounds: a second net server cost 192 unreclaimed pages and a later test found 137
/// free frames. That reason is recorded as fixed (2026-08-16, `Holding::release_or_fail`), and this
/// lane is the first to actually spend the thing the fix was supposed to buy. It held: 33 devices,
/// the new gate under five seconds, and the frame ledger untroubled. So the eighth receipt's
/// conclusion ("the constraint was never this table") is confirmed from the other side, and what is
/// left here really is only the counter.
///
/// **Which is the argument for the unregister, not against it.** Nothing above is a reason to keep
