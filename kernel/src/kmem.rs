//! **The kernel's own object budget** (milestone 19c.1; design/init-and-granular-spawn.md).
//!
//! One untyped region, carved once at first use, that every kernel-owned object draws from:
//! kernel endpoints (moved here from `IpcTables`'s private region), kernel thread stacks
//! (which used to draw open-endedly from the frame allocator), and, with 19c.2, the kernel's
//! own TCB pages. This is the milestone 14 thesis extended to its last uncovered corner: after
//! this carve, **the kernel cannot spend beyond it, structurally**. The frame allocator's count
//! does not move when kernel threads come and go; a steady-state test asserts exactly zero.
//!
//! # Recycling, and why it is not an allocator
//!
//! Region pages are watermark-carved and never individually returned (untyped.rs). Kernel
//! threads churn constantly (every test spawns some), so spend-only pages would exhaust any
//! carve. The fix is a fixed free-stack of dead object pages, reused page-for-page: a reaped
//! thread's stack pages and (19c.2) TCB page go on it, the next spawn takes them back. This is
//! page-granular, bounded by the carve, FIFO-free, and deliberately not a general allocator:
//! one size (a page), one owner (the kernel), no headers, no coalescing, nothing to verify
//! beyond a bounded stack. The distinction between this and the heap milestone 14 deleted is
//! the distinction between a budget and a market.
//!
//! Creator-paid, resolved (the 19c conversation): a kernel-created thread's stack comes from
//! this carve because **the kernel is its creator**; an init-created TCB's memory comes from
//! init's untyped because init is. One principle, two payers, no third regime.

/// The carve: 2048 pages (8 MiB). Endpoints (one page each, ~60 across a full test run), live
/// kernel stacks (6 pages x up to `MAX_THREADS`; see thread.rs `STACK_PAGES`), TCB pages (one
/// each, 19c.2), and slack. Exhaustion fails the spawn or create cleanly, the same contract as
/// every budget since milestone 11; raising this constant is the fix if the image ever
/// legitimately needs more, and there have now been two such days.
///
/// 2026-08-15: this was 768 when stacks were 4 pages (512 of 768 budgeted for stacks, the same
/// two-to-one ratio kept since), and the 24 KiB stacks made stacks alone outgrow the whole carve.
/// The symptom was `kmem::page()` returning `None` late in the aarch64 suite, surfacing as an
/// unrelated test's spawn failing with "no memory to wire one", exactly the failure shape this
/// module's budget contract promises (clean refusal, far from the cause).
///
/// 2026-08-27: `sched::MAX_THREADS` doubled to 256 on a measured peak (its own doc comment carries
/// the numbers), and this constant is the reason that raise is not free. A thread costs **7 pages
/// here**, six of stack and one of TCB, so 256 of them is 1792, endpoints are ~60, and 2048 leaves
/// 196 of slack. That is the whole arithmetic, and it is deliberately written as a sum rather than
/// as a ratio to the old number: a carve sized by doubling would have been a guess, and a carve
/// left at 1024 would have moved the ceiling from the thread table down to here, one level lower
/// and no easier to diagnose.
