//! **The kernel's own object budget** (milestone 19c.1; design/init-and-granular-spawn.md).
//!
//! One untyped region, carved once at first use, that every kernel-owned object draws from:
//! kernel endpoints (moved here from `IpcTables`'s private region), kernel thread stacks
//! (which used to draw open-endedly from the frame allocator), and, with 19c.2, the kernel's
//! own TCB pages. This is the milestone 14 thesis extended to its last uncovered corner: after
//! this carve, **the kernel cannot spend beyond it, structurally**. The frame allocator's count
//! does not move when kernel threads come and go; a steady-state test asserts exactly zero.
//!
//! # Recycling, and why it is not an allocator
//!
//! Region pages are watermark-carved and never individually returned (untyped.rs). Kernel
//! threads churn constantly (every test spawns some), so spend-only pages would exhaust any
//! carve. The fix is a fixed free-stack of dead object pages, reused page-for-page: a reaped
//! thread's stack pages and (19c.2) TCB page go on it, the next spawn takes them back. This is
//! page-granular, bounded by the carve, FIFO-free, and deliberately not a general allocator:
//! one size (a page), one owner (the kernel), no headers, no coalescing, nothing to verify
//! beyond a bounded stack. The distinction between this and the heap milestone 14 deleted is
//! the distinction between a budget and a market.
//!
//! Creator-paid, resolved (the 19c conversation): a kernel-created thread's stack comes from
//! this carve because **the kernel is its creator**; an init-created TCB's memory comes from
//! init's untyped because init is. One principle, two payers, no third regime.
