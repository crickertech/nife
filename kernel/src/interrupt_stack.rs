//! The per-CPU interrupt stack: where a trap taken on kernel code builds its frames.
//!
//! # The problem it solves
//!
//! A kernel thread runs on its own 24 KiB stack. When the timer interrupts it, the trap frame and
//! every frame of the handler above it were built **on that thread's stack**, at whatever depth the
//! thread happened to be. So the thread's stack had to be big enough for its own deepest chain
//! *plus* a whole interrupt, and a preemption arriving at the worst instant was the difference
//! between fitting and not.
//!
//! That is not a hypothesis. The 2026-08-15 CI overflows were symbolized to a thread spinning for
//! `IPC_TABLES` with about 272 bytes of stack left, and the arithmetic behind it charged ~2.3 KiB to the
//! interrupted thread for one preemption: trap frame, dispatch, the interrupt controller's claim,
//! the tick, and the scheduler. Milestone 124's interim fix grew the stack from 16 KiB to 24 KiB
//! with that measurement in hand and said in the same breath that the structural fix was **to bound
//! the cost rather than to pay it**. This is that fix. See notes/stack.md.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! One stack per core, over its own unmapped guard page, in a `(NOLOAD)` region the linker anchors
//! (`.interrupt_stacks`). A trap **from kernel mode** saves its frame on the interrupted stack, as
//! it always did, and then the handler body runs over here; a trap from user mode does not switch,
//! because a user thread's kernel stack is empty at that moment and because the syscall it is
//! probably taking will block, which this stack may not do.
//!
//! # The one rule, and why it is not negotiable
//!
//! **Nothing that runs on an interrupt stack may context-switch away from it.**
//!
//! A context switch parks the current `sp` in the outgoing thread's `Context` and resumes it later.
//! If that `sp` pointed here, the thread would resume on a stack that belongs to a core rather than
//! to it, and whose bytes the next interrupt on that core has already overwritten. So the deferred
//! `schedule()` at the tail of an interrupt runs **after** the handler returns to the interrupted
//! stack: `sched::preempt_if_needed` is called by the arch dispatcher's outer half, one frame
//! outside the switch. Three mechanisms hold it, deliberately overlapping, because a violation
//! would corrupt a stack rather than fault:
//!
//!   1. `sched::schedule` debug-asserts that `sp` is not on an interrupt stack.
//!   2. `script/stack-depth-check` proves in CI that no context switch is *reachable* from the
//!      interrupt-stack entry point, on both architectures.
//!   3. This paragraph, at the thing itself.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A trap from user mode does not switch**, so a deep syscall is still charged to the calling
//!   thread's kernel stack. That is correct rather than lazy (a syscall blocks, and a blocked
//!   thread's frames must live on its own stack), but it means this bounds the *interrupt* cost
//!   and not the *trap* cost.
//! - **The switch happens after the frame is saved**, so the trap frame itself (272 bytes on
//!   aarch64, 288 on riscv64) is still built on the interrupted stack. It has to be: a preempted
//!   thread's frame must survive until that thread runs again, and this stack cannot promise that.
//! - **A stack overflow whose first fault is the vector's own frame store still cascades.** The
//!   vector saves before anything can decide to switch, so this does not rescue an overflow that
//!   is already past the guard; it makes such an overflow much less likely instead.
//! - **The stacks are never reclaimed and cost `MAX_CPUS` slots whether or not the cores exist**,
//!   like the secondary stacks beside them. 160 KiB of address space and RAM for eight seats.
