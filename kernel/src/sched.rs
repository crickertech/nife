//! A round-robin scheduler, and the preemption that makes it mean something.
//!
//! # The whole point of the project, arriving
//!
//! DECISIONS.md §5, written before a line of kernel existed:
//!
//! > A userspace process is an arbitrary ELF binary. It has its own stack, it never yields, and
//! > it will loop forever because we will write a bug. Under cooperative scheduling, one bad
//! > user program hangs the machine permanently.
//!
//! This file is where that stops being true. The timer fires, the handler calls [`schedule`],
//! and the CPU is **taken away** from a thread that never asked to give it up.
//!
//! There is a test named `a_thread_that_never_yields_is_preempted_anyway`. It spawns a thread
//! whose entire body is `loop { count += 1 }`: no yields, no syscalls, not even a function
//! call. Under any cooperative scheduler that is a hung machine. Here it is a Tuesday.
//!
//! # Three rules, and each of them is a bug if you get it wrong
//!
//! **1. Release the run-queue lock BEFORE switching.** Switch away while holding it and the
//!    lock is now held by a thread that is not running. The next thread to want it spins
//!    forever waiting for a thread that will never be scheduled, because scheduling requires
//!    the lock. A deadlock of a shape that would take a day to find.
//!
//! **2. Interrupts stay masked across the switch.** Between "I decided to switch" and "I
//!    switched" there must be no window for a timer interrupt to decide *again*. And the mask
//!    is per-thread, because each thread's `schedule()` frame lives on its own stack, which is
//!    exactly what makes this work at all.
//!
//! **3. A brand-new thread must unmask interrupts itself.** Every *resumed* thread gets its
//!    interrupt state back from `eret` restoring `SPSR_EL1`. A thread that has never run has no
//!    `SPSR` to restore. `thread_trampoline` does `msr daifclr, #2` for exactly this reason,
//!    and without it the first thread you spawn can never be preempted, which would be a
//!    cooperative scheduler with extra steps.

    // console server out of init's budget and that server blocks in its serve loop, so init's
    // 2048-frame region was unreclaimable by construction. See notes/frames.md.

    // the refusal rather than by a hang (see `user::holding::Holding`'s BUGS).

    // is the same commitment one object over: the caller has said this region is going away. What it
    // must not do is *surprise* anyone, which is why it is written here rather than assumed.
    //
    // **Rescan for one at a time rather than listing them all first.** The obvious shape is to walk
    // the table into a `[u64; MAX_RENDEZVOUS]` and then walk that, because `remove` mutates the table

    // bytes MORE than all the headroom there was. See notes/stack-high-water.md.

    // RISC-V has nothing of the kind. `sip.SEIP` is read-only to S-mode (only the PLIC, driven by a
    // real wire, sets it), the PLIC's pending block is read-only by specification, and the one
