//! **The portable IOMMU seam** (milestone 16b; DECISIONS §20, notes/iommu.md).
//!
//! One IOMMU confines a device by translating every address it emits through page tables the
//! kernel programs, in the CPU's own page-table format. aarch64 has an SMMUv3 that walks
//! VMSAv8-64; riscv has the ratified RISC-V IOMMU (v1.0.1) that walks Sv39. Those are the two
//! formats the `paging` crate already builds for process address spaces, so a device's DMA domain
//! is not a new kind of table (`paging::domain::build_identity_domain`). This module is the thin,
//! architecture-neutral layer that ties that portable domain builder to whichever arch IOMMU
//! driver is compiled in (`crate::arch::iommu`): pick the frame allocator and the format, build
//! the domain, hand its root to the driver's `attach`. Everything ISA-specific (the register file,
//! the stream/device table, the command and fault queues) lives under `arch/`, per rule #1.
//!
//! # What "confine" does, and why it fails closed
//!
//! `confine(rid, regions)` builds an identity map (IOVA == PA) over exactly `regions` and nothing
//! else, then attaches the device whose requester id is `rid` to it. From that point the device
//! reaches precisely the frames in `regions`; any other address it emits has no mapping, so the
//! IOMMU faults instead of touching memory. Before `confine` runs for a device, the driver's
//! `init` has already installed an all-invalid stream table / device directory, so an unattached
//! device is denied by default. The window between "the bus grants Bus-Master Enable" and "the
//! kernel confines the device" is therefore closed by the hardware, not by careful ordering.

// fields without ever naming the type, so both re-exports are allowed to be locally unused.
