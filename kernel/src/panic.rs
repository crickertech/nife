//! What happens when the kernel panics.
//!
//! `std` provides a panic handler, so you have never had to think about this.
//! Without `std` you must write one, and it forces a real question: there is no
//! process to kill, no stderr, no shell to return to. What *should* happen?
//!
//! Our answer: say what went wrong, then stop the machine. Under `cargo test`, a
//! panic is a failing test, so we exit QEMU with a failure status instead.

// Both imports feed the handler below and nothing else, so a `cfg(kani)` build (which has no
// handler; see the comment on it) has no use for them.
#[cfg(not(kani))]
use core::panic::PanicInfo;

#[cfg(not(kani))]
use crate::{arch, println};

// **Absent under `cfg(kani)`, and that is a hole this milestone opened on purpose.** Kani links
// `std` into the crate it proves, and `std` already defines the `panic_impl` lang item, so a second
// definition here is a hard compile error rather than a choice. The shipping kernel is unaffected:
// `cargo kani` is the only thing that ever sets this cfg. What it costs a reader is that a proof
// cannot observe this handler's behaviour, so nothing proved about the kernel says anything about
// what happens after a panic. See notes/kernel-proofs.md.

    // SAFETY: we are dying. If we panicked while holding the console lock (a fault taken
    // inside a print), taking it again here would hang and we would lose the one message
    // that matters. Break it open. See sync.rs.
    // Forget what we thought we held, BEFORE trying to print.
    //
    // If we panicked while holding the console lock, HELD_RANK is 10, and the print below would
    // try to take rank 10 again. `10 < 10` is false, so the lock-ranking assertion would fire a
    // violation *inside the panic handler* and we would lose the original message to a
    // recursive panic. The bookkeeping is a debugging aid; it must never be the thing that
    // stops us saying what went wrong.
