//! **A timed window can exclude preemption, and this is the test that says so.**
//! Milestone 541 (a timed window that excludes preemption).
//!
//! `kernel/src/bench.rs`'s `map_new` masks interrupts across its timed window, because the window
//! is roughly 250 microseconds of guest time against a 10 ms scheduler tick (`TICK_HZ` is 100 on
//! all three architectures) and whether a timer interrupt lands inside it is therefore decided by
//! the phase the boot left the timer in. On 2026-09-21 a semantically identical rewrite of one
//! expression in `schedule()` moved that phase, one preemption landed in the window, and the row
//! read +26.4% and failed the tripwire while the map path's object code was byte-identical. See
//! notes/benchmarks.md and design/roadmap/541-a-timed-window-that-excludes-preemption.md.
//!
//! **The benchmark build is not the tested build**, which is the gap this file closes. `--features
//! bench` compiles the tour out and runs no tests, so nothing in the test suite ever executes
//! `map_new`'s masked window; what the suite *can* test is the primitive that window rests on,
//! which is that `arch::interrupts::disable` actually suppresses the scheduler tick and `restore`
//! actually brings it back. If either half stopped being true, `map_new` would go back to timing
//! the scheduler and would say nothing about it.
//!
//! These tests spin against the wall clock rather than counting instructions, so they hold under
//! `-icount` and under HVF alike: the counter `now()` reads advances in both.
//!
//! **What they do not trust the wall clock for is the tick being raised.** Both used to assume that
//! a masked spin of three tick periods guarantees a tick is pending when it ends. It does not: the
//! emulator raises the timer from its own main loop, and on 2026-09-24 that measured 1 to 5 ms
//! after the deadline typically and **86 ms** at worst, over 2,000 masked windows on the riscv64
//! `sifive-u54` model. So `unmasking_delivers_the_tick_that_was_held` failed CI once on `rv64`
//! (pull request #1195, a change to `design/decisions/` alone) saying the held tick had been
//! dropped. The same measurement found the kernel taking the tick at the unmask in every one of
//! 4,000 windows once it was pending, so the likely reading of that red is a tick not yet raised
//! rather than one dropped; the log cannot say which, and that is the gap. Each window now ends only once the
//! architecture says the tick is pending ([`until_the_tick_is_raised`]), which makes the first test
//! non-vacuous and takes the host out of the second. See notes/load-sensitive-assertions.md.
