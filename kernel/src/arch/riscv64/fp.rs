//! **A thread's floating-point registers, RISC-V.** The register file, the `sstatus.FS` writes that
//! decide who may touch it, and nothing else: the policy is [`crate::fp`]'s.
//!
//! # `sstatus.FS` is the best of the three, and this kernel uses a quarter of it
//!
//! Where aarch64 has an on/off switch and x86 has a one-bit "somebody else owns this", RISC-V has a
//! **four-state machine** in `sstatus[14:13]`, designed by people who had context switching in mind:
//!
//! | value | name | meaning |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `0b00` | Off | FP instructions raise an illegal-instruction trap |
//! | `0b01` | Initial | the registers hold their initial values |
//! | `0b10` | Clean | the registers match the copy in memory |
//! | `0b11` | Dirty | the hardware set this because something *wrote* an FP register |
//!
//! Dirty is a hardware-maintained dirty bit. A kernel that keeps a thread's saved copy in a stable
//! place can ask "have these registers been written since I loaded them" and skip the save when the
//! answer is no, which is a strictly better question than the one aarch64 can answer.
//!
//! **This kernel asks the coarse question anyway**, using `Off` against everything else as a plain
//! enable bit, because [`crate::fp`]'s rule is uniform across three ISAs and no workload exists yet
//! to measure the difference on. That is a deliberate cost, recorded in that module's `BUGS` and
//! here, rather than an oversight.
//!
//! # `sstatus` travels in the trap frame, and that is the trap
//!
//! On the other two architectures the control register this module writes is invisible to the trap
//! path. Here it is not: `TrapFrame::sstatus` is saved on trap entry and written back by `trap.s`'s
//! `csrw sstatus, t0` on the way out, so a handler that sets `FS` in the live CSR and returns has
//! its write undone by its own return. The first-use handler in `exceptions.rs` therefore sets the
//! **frame's** copy as well, and it is the only place that has to think about this: every later
//! switch sets the live CSR from [`crate::fp::hand_over`] to match the incoming thread's `live`,
//! and that thread's frame carries the same value because it was captured while the same flag held.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A hart with no D extension cannot run this at all**, and says so rather than looping.
//!   `sstatus.FS` is hardwired to zero on such a part, so [`enable`] does not take, [`is_enabled`]
//!   reports it, and `crate::fp::enable_for_current` turns the first-use trap into an ordinary
//!   fault. The thread dies with an illegal instruction, which is the truth. Nothing tests this:
//!   every machine in this tree's matrix (`qemu-system-riscv64 -cpu rv64`, the JH7110's U74) has D.
//! - **F without D is not handled.** A part with F only has 32-bit registers where [`fp.s`] writes
//!   64, so the save would be wrong rather than refused. `arch::isa` already reads the ISA string
//!   and is where that check belongs; it is recorded rather than built.
