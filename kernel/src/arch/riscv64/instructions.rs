//! **One function per instruction**: the riscv64 `asm!` that logic calls, kept out of the logic so a
//! proof can replace it.
//!
//! *Name provisional (a lane minted it 2026-09-25; names are calef's). It says what every item here
//! is, one machine instruction, rather than what register it touches, because not all of them touch a
//! CSR: `wfi`, the fences and the two general-register moves live here too.*
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! The model checker cannot reason about `asm!`. A harness whose call graph reaches one fails with
//! "`InlineAsm` is not currently supported", so any logic *around* an instruction was unprovable for
//! as long as the instruction sat inline in it: `current_root_pa` was one mask and a shift, and no
//! harness could reach it, because the `csrr` that fed it was in the same function.
//!
//! So the rule for this directory, riscv64 first (see
//! design/roadmap/proposals/kani-can-target-riscv64-from-the-hosts-we-have.md, "Containment,
//! priced"): **logic calls these, and these contain nothing but the instruction.** A harness then
//! replaces one with `#[kani::stub]` and a model, and the logic that called it becomes reachable.
//! notes/kernel-proofs/stubbing-an-instruction.md has the pattern and its caveat.
//!
//! # A stub is an assumption about the hardware
//!
//! Every model that replaces a function here is a claim about what the silicon does, written by
//! somebody who read the specification and could have misread it. A proof over a stub proves the
//! logic *given that claim*, and the claim itself is tested only by the QEMU and board suites. So a
//! function here stays exactly one instruction (or one fixed sequence that has no Rust meaning of its
//! own, like `sfence.vma` with no operands), and each one's documentation says what a model of it
//! must honour.
//!
//! # Codegen
//!
//! Every function is `#[inline(always)]`, so the instruction lands in its caller exactly where the
//! inline `asm!` used to, with the same operands and the same `options`. The `options` are copied
//! from each call site rather than unified: `nomem` on an `sstatus` write that changes what S-mode
//! may *load* would let the compiler move a user-page access across it, which is why
//! [`read_and_set_sstatus`] and [`read_and_clear_sstatus`] do not carry it and [`set_sstatus`] does.
//!
//! What stays `asm!` outside this file, on purpose: the register-preservation trap test in
//! `exceptions.rs` (it is a test *of* registers), `fp::touch`'s one FP instruction (a test that the
//! instruction traps), `timer::calibration_loop` (its instruction count is the point), `pmu::read_csr`
//! (a dispatch whose every arm is already one `csrr`, because the CSR number is an immediate), and
//! every SBI `ecall`, which goes through [`super::sbi::call`] instead.
