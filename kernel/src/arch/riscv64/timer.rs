//! **The timer, RISC-V.** The S-mode analog of aarch64's generic virtual timer.
//!
//! RISC-V exposes a free-running counter through the `time` CSR (read with `rdtime`). The next tick
//! is scheduled through the **SBI TIME** extension (`sbi_set_timer`, an `ecall` to OpenSBI in
//! M-mode), which both arms the next S-mode timer interrupt and clears the pending one. The Sstc
//! extension's `stimecmp` CSR would avoid the M-mode round trip, but SBI TIME works on every
//! OpenSBI and is the portable choice for now. See notes/riscv-port.md.
//!
//! # The deadline is remembered in software, and that is the whole difference
//!
//! aarch64 re-arms from `CNTV_CVAL_EL0`, an absolute deadline it can **read back out of the
//! hardware**, so `next = CVAL + interval` puts the deadlines on a fixed grid for free. RISC-V's
//! SBI `set_timer` is write-only: the firmware takes an absolute `time` value and gives nothing
//! back. So the grid has to be kept here, in [`DEADLINE`].
//!
//! Until milestone 19's test lane this file did the easy thing instead and re-armed with
//! `now() + interval` from inside the handler, which is **the same drift bug aarch64 shipped and
//! measured**: `now()` is read after the trap entry and the SBI round trip, so every period is
//! `interval + latency`, the lateness compounds, and the configured rate is not the delivered rate.
//! Nothing caught it because this ISA had no timer tests. See notes/riscv-arch-tests.md.
