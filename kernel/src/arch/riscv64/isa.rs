//! **Ask the RISC-V machine what it is, once, at boot.**
//!
//! Milestone 60. The decoding is all in [`machine_discovery::riscv64`], which is host-testable; what can only
//! happen on the machine is here: reading the device tree firmware handed us, asking that firmware
//! what it implements over SBI, and refusing to continue if the answer is a machine this kernel
//! cannot run on.
//!
//! Three sources, in the order they arrive:
//!
//! 1. **The device tree** ([`init`]), which is firmware's claim about the silicon.
//! 2. **SBI** ([`init`] again), which is firmware's claim about itself. `sbi_probe_extension` is
//!    the only way to know whether the four `ecall`s this kernel makes unconditionally will do
//!    anything at all.
//! 3. **The `satp.ASID` probe** ([`record_asid_bits`]), which is a measurement and arrives later,
//!    because it cannot run until `mmu::init` has installed the real page tables.
//!
//! # Where this is called from, and why in that order
//!
//! `kernel_main` runs [`init`] after `memory::init` (which needs the device tree first) and before
//! `mmu::init` (which is what would build tables a refused machine cannot walk). `mmu::init` then
//! calls [`record_asid_bits`] after its probe, and the boot prints [`print_summary`] once paging is
//! on, before any of the test, shell or bench branches, so every boot mode reports the machine.
