# Saving and restoring the FP register file, RISC-V. The assembly half of fp.rs.
#
# Structurally identical to arch/aarch64/fp.s; only the register set and the way the assembler is
# talked into accepting it differ. `f0`-`f31` are 64 bits each under the D extension, so this is
# 256 bytes against aarch64's 512, and `fcsr` carries both the rounding mode and the accrued
# exception flags in one CSR where aarch64 has two.
#
# # The `.option arch, +d`
#
# The kernel's target is `riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf`: integer, atomics, compressed, and
# deliberately no F and no D, so that the compiler cannot emit floating point into a kernel that
# had nowhere to save it. That is a statement about generated code, not about code written on
# purpose to move the register file, and `.option push` / `.option arch, +d` widens the assembler
# for exactly these two routines and `.option pop` puts it back.
#
# **The machine still has to have the extension.** `qemu-system-riscv64 -cpu rv64` and the JH7110's
# U74 cores both do. A hart that does not implement D leaves `sstatus.FS` hardwired to zero, which
# is the case `fp::is_enabled` reports back to `crate::fp::enable_for_current`; see fp.rs.

# The mirror. `fcsr` first, so that the loads below cannot be affected by a rounding mode belonging
# to the thread that just left; they are bit patterns rather than arithmetic, so it makes no
# difference today, and the ordering costs nothing and will still be right if that changes.
#
# Called with `sstatus.FS != Off`, which `fp.rs` guarantees: an `fld` under `FS == Off` raises the
# illegal-instruction trap this whole mechanism exists to serve, from inside the scheduler.
