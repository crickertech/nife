//! **Interrupt masking, RISC-V.** The S-mode analog of aarch64's `PSTATE.DAIF` handling.
//!
//! On RISC-V, S-mode interrupts are gated by one bit, `SIE` (Supervisor Interrupt Enable) in the
//! `sstatus` CSR. Setting it lets enabled sources (in `sie`) interrupt; clearing it masks them all.
//! These are leaf primitives with no dependencies, so they are implemented for real even though the
//! rest of the RISC-V trap path is not yet built. They are correct standard rv64, but unexercised
//! until the kernel boots on RISC-V.
