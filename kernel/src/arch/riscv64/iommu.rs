//! The RISC-V IOMMU (v1.0.1) driver: riscv's IOMMU, in front of the PCIe bus.
//!
//! Milestone 16b (DECISIONS §20, notes/iommu.md). The ratified RISC-V IOMMU is the architectural
//! twin of the SMMUv3 next door (arch/aarch64/iommu.rs), and the structural rhyme is the point of
//! building both: a **device directory table** instead of a stream table (keyed by the PCIe
//! requester id, called `device_id`), a **device context** instead of an STE+CD (the IOMMU's copy
//! of `satp`: a first-stage `iosatp` naming an Sv39 root the portable seam built), a **command
//! queue** for invalidations, and a **fault queue** where blocked transactions are recorded.
//!
//! On QEMU's `virt` board the IOMMU is itself a PCI function (`riscv-iommu-pci`, Red Hat
//! 1b36:0014): its register file lives in BAR 0, which the kernel places like any other BAR (the
//! kernel is the firmware here; see notes/pcie.md). The portable seam does that PCI legwork and
//! hands this module the register base; everything after that is this file.
//!
//! # Default deny, and one honest asymmetry
//!
//! `init` installs an all-invalid device directory before enabling anything, so a device the
//! kernel never attached faults (`DDT_ENTRY_INVALID`) instead of reaching memory. Before `init`
//! runs, though, the reset state of `ddtp` is mode `Off`, which *blocks* all transactions on this
//! IOMMU, so the pre-init window fails closed by architecture here; the SMMU needed an explicit
//! `GBPA.ABORT` for the same posture. Sv39 single-stage translation requires the U bit on every
//! leaf (a device does not "request supervisor privilege"), which is why the seam builds domains
//! with `user_data` flags; see `paging::domain`.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The MSI page table is offered and deliberately not used** (milestone 317). `CAPS.MSI_FLAT`
//!   is set on QEMU's `riscv-iommu-pci` (measured: `CAPS = 0x78c2cf4f10`, bit 22 set, on QEMU
//!   11.1.1's `virt`), so every device context here is the extended 64-byte format and carries
//!   `msiptp`, `msi_addr_mask` and `msi_addr_pattern`. [`attach`] writes all four of those words
//!   **zero**, which is `msiptp.MODE = Off`. No MSI page table is allocated and no entry in one is
//!   ever programmed.
//!
//!   **This is the whole of riscv's position on interrupt confinement, and it is not a gap in the
//!   same shape as the other two.** MSI confinement lives somewhere different on each
//!   architecture: a separate IOMMU feature on `x86_64` (`ECAP.IR`, and VT-d intercepts a write to
//!   the MSI address range so DMA remapping alone does not cover it), a separate *device* on
//!   aarch64 (the `GICv3` ITS, which this tree's GICv2 machine does not have at all), and here, one
//!   mode field inside a device context this driver already writes.
//!
//!   **What `MODE = Off` means for a transaction is a reading of the spec and not a measurement**,
//!   and it is flagged as such because this tree has carried a claim from memory before. The
//!   RISC-V IOMMU specification says MSI address translation is not performed in that mode and the
//!   transaction is translated as an ordinary memory access, which would mean an MSI-shaped write
//!   from an attached device is still bounded by the `iosatp` domain rather than escaping it. **No
//!   boot here has tested that**, nothing forges an MSI, and `MSI page table offered (mode off)`
//!   in the machine description is a report of the capability bit, not of any behaviour.
//!   See design/roadmap/317-interrupt-remapping-flags.md.
//! - **Untestable on the silicon this project owns, which inverts `x86_64`'s position.** The
//!   comment below on `CAP_MSI_FLAT` notes that real silicon without MSI support reports
//!   otherwise, and that branch has run zero times: no board shipping the ratified RISC-V IOMMU
//!   exists (milestone 143), and radon (the `VisionFive` 2) has no IOMMU at all. So this
//!   architecture is confined in the emulated case and has no second witness, where `x86_64` has
//!   xenon waiting to provide one.
