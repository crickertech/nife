//! The RISC-V IOMMU (v1.0.1) driver: riscv's IOMMU, in front of the PCIe bus.
//!
//! Milestone 16b (DECISIONS §20, notes/iommu.md). The ratified RISC-V IOMMU is the architectural
//! twin of the SMMUv3 next door (arch/aarch64/iommu.rs), and the structural rhyme is the point of
//! building both: a **device directory table** instead of a stream table (keyed by the PCIe
//! requester id, called `device_id`), a **device context** instead of an STE+CD (the IOMMU's copy
//! of `satp`: a first-stage `iosatp` naming an Sv39 root the portable seam built), a **command
//! queue** for invalidations, and a **fault queue** where blocked transactions are recorded.
//!
//! On QEMU's `virt` board the IOMMU is itself a PCI function (`riscv-iommu-pci`, Red Hat
//! 1b36:0014): its register file lives in BAR 0, which the kernel places like any other BAR (the
//! kernel is the firmware here; see notes/pcie.md). The portable seam does that PCI legwork and
//! hands this module the register base; everything after that is this file.
//!
//! # Default deny, and one honest asymmetry
//!
//! `init` installs an all-invalid device directory before enabling anything, so a device the
//! kernel never attached faults (`DDT_ENTRY_INVALID`) instead of reaching memory. Before `init`
//! runs, though, the reset state of `ddtp` is mode `Off`, which *blocks* all transactions on this
//! IOMMU, so the pre-init window fails closed by architecture here; the SMMU needed an explicit
//! `GBPA.ABORT` for the same posture. Sv39 single-stage translation requires the U bit on every
//! leaf (a device does not "request supervisor privilege"), which is why the seam builds domains
//! with `user_data` flags; see `paging::domain`.
