//! **Ask firmware for a hardware cycle counter, and read it** (milestone 74, riscv64 half).
//!
//! The RISC-V hardware performance counters live in M-mode. `mcycle` and the `mhpmcounterX` CSRs
//! can only be started, stopped and configured from there (`mcountinhibit`, `mhpmeventX`), so a
//! supervisor-mode kernel cannot program them itself. The SBI **PMU** extension (EID `0x504D55`,
//! `"PMU"`) is the interface firmware exposes for exactly this, and it is the whole reason this
//! module exists rather than a `csrw`.
//!
//! # What this is for, and what it is deliberately not
//!
//! `crate::arch::timer::now()` reads the `time` CSR, a **fixed-rate reference tick**. That is the
//! OS's clock and it is the right instrument for a long loop. It is not cycles, and the literature
//! this project is compared against is denominated in cycles: milestone 74's block sets out the
//! difference and notes/pmu.md calls confusing the two a category error.
//!
//! **One counter, configured for one event, started and stopped.** Milestone 74's scope note
//! refuses a profiling framework, and the PMU can count dozens of events. Generalising this to a
//! counter set with a named target is milestone 147's, and it should wait for that second consumer.
//!
//! # The shape of the interface, from the specification
//!
//! Everything here is the RISC-V SBI Specification **v3.0** (ratified 2025-07-16), `src/ext-pmu.adoc`,
//! read 2026-09-03 from `github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-sbi-doc` at tag `v3.0`. Four calls:
//!
//! 1. `sbi_pmu_num_counters` (FID #0), how many logical counters this hart has.
//! 2. `sbi_pmu_counter_config_matching` (FID #2), "find a counter from this set which is not
//!    started and can monitor this event", which is how a caller gets a counter without knowing
//!    the platform's event-to-counter mapping.
//! 3. `sbi_pmu_counter_get_info` (FID #1), which says whether the counter it found is hardware or
//!    firmware and, for hardware, **which CSR reads it**.
//! 4. `sbi_pmu_counter_stop` (FID #4).
//!
//! The read itself is not an `ecall`. That is the point of step 3: firmware hands back a CSR
//! number and the counter is then read with one instruction, so a measurement does not contain the
//! call that would dominate it. (A *firmware* counter would have to be read with FID #5, an
//! `ecall` per read; this module refuses those, and [`init`] says why.)
//!
//! # Why the counter this asks for is startable at all
//!
//! OpenSBI leaves the fixed counters running and open to S-mode. Read from
//! `lib/sbi/sbi_hart.c` on `riscv-software-src/opensbi` master, 2026-09-03: it writes
//! `CSR_MCOUNTEREN, -1` ("Supervisor mode usage for all counters are enabled by default") and
//! `CSR_MCOUNTINHIBIT, 0xFFFFFFF8`, which leaves bits 0 (`CY`) and 2 (`IR`) clear, so `mcycle` and
//! `minstret` run and only the programmable counters are inhibited until S-mode asks. **That is
//! upstream OpenSBI, not radon's firmware**, and it is a claim about somebody else's build until a
//! bench reads it; notes/riscv-cycle-counters.md makes checking it step one of the procedure.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Nothing here has been run on silicon.** QEMU-TCG models an instruction counter that has
//!   nothing to do with cycles, so a green test under emulation proves the plumbing and says
//!   nothing about the measurement. Every number this module can produce today is an emulator's
//!   fiction. notes/riscv-cycle-counters.md carries the bench procedure that would fix that.
//! - **The boot hart only.** SBI PMU counters are per-hart: `counter_config_matching` and
//!   `counter_start` act on the calling hart, and the counter index a hart is given is that hart's.
//!   [`init`] runs once, on the hart that runs `kernel_main`, and [`cycles`] is therefore only
//!   meaningful to a reader who knows which hart it ran on. The consumer today is a single-hart
//!   bench probe. A per-hart record is real work and belongs with a caller that needs it.
//! - **A firmware counter is refused rather than used.** If firmware answers with a counter it
//!   maintains itself, this module reports no cycle counter at all. That is a deliberate refusal:
//!   reading one costs an `ecall`, and an `ecall` inside a cycle measurement measures the `ecall`.
//! - **`counter_stop` is never called on the happy path.** The counter this configures runs for the
//!   life of the boot. That is correct for a free-running cycle counter, whose value is only ever
//!   read as a difference, and it is why [`stop`] exists but is only used by the test that proves
//!   the call works.
