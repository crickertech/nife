# The kernel's real entry on RISC-V, and the higher-half transition.
#
# OpenSBI (the -bios, in M-mode) hands the S-mode payload control at its PHYSICAL load address
# (0x8020_0000) per the Linux RISC-V boot protocol, with a0 = hart id and a1 = the device-tree
# pointer. The kernel is linked HIGH (link-riscv64.ld), so every absolute symbol is a high-half VA, but
# we are executing at low physical addresses with paging off. So, exactly like aarch64's boot.s:
#
#   1. use PC-relative addressing (`lla`) while paging is off, which yields correct PHYSICAL addresses
#      (the relative offset is the same whether symbols are linked high or low),
#   2. point satp at a boot table that maps the kernel both at its physical address (so this code
#      keeps executing across the `csrw satp`) and at its high-half alias,
#   3. jump to the high-half alias of ourselves, and only then touch absolute (high) symbols.
#
# This is the single sketchiest moment in the RISC-V port: if the boot table is wrong, the `csrw
# satp` fetches the next instruction through a broken mapping and the machine vanishes with no
# output. See notes/riscv-port.md and arch/riscv64/mmu.rs (BOOT_PAGE_TABLE).

# CFI (call-frame information): see notes/cfi-unwind.md. No directives on `_start` itself below:
# like kernel/src/arch/aarch64/image_header.s, it is a data structure (the RISC-V Image header)
# with one instruction grafted onto its front so the entry point can also be byte 0 of it; function
# directives on it would claim it is a function, which it is not. `_start_kernel` (the real code)
# gets them instead.

    # The RISC-V Linux Image header (milestone 16a, notes/visionfive2.md). U-Boot's `booti` refuses
    # a payload without it, and QEMU never reads it (`-kernel` takes the ELF), so these 64 bytes are
    # what makes one kernel binary loadable by both. Layout per Linux's
    # Documentation/arch/riscv/boot-image-header.rst (header version 0.2); U-Boot checks exactly one
    # field, the u32 magic 0x05435352 ("RSC\x05") at offset 0x38 (u-boot arch/riscv/lib/image.c).
    #
    # code0/code1 are "executable code": the entry point is the header itself, so code0 jumps over
    # it. `j` may assemble compressed (2 bytes) under the C extension; the `.balign 8` absorbs
    # either width, so every field lands at its required offset.

    # AN EXCEPTION AND A FOOT GUN: Linux uses 0x200000, "2 MiB into RAM". We deliberately encode
    # 0x40200000 so that on the VisionFive 2 (DRAM base 0x4000_0000) booti places the image at
    # 0x8020_0000, the PHYS_START this kernel is linked for (link-riscv64.ld), which on QEMU virt is
    # DRAM base + 2 MiB. One linked address, both machines, no board relink; the cost is that this
    # header is wrong for any board whose RAM does not put 0x8020_0000 inside it. Revisit if the
    # kernel ever learns to run at an arbitrary load address. See notes/visionfive2.md.
