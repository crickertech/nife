//! Masking and unmasking interrupts.
//!
//! On aarch64 this is the `I` bit of **`PSTATE.DAIF`**:
//!
//! | Bit | Name | Masks |
//! |-----|------|-------|
//! | 9   | `D`  | Debug exceptions |
//! | 8   | `A`  | SError (system errors) |
//! | 7   | `I`  | **IRQ** |
//! | 6   | `F`  | FIQ |
//!
//! Set the bit to **mask** (disable), clear it to **unmask** (enable). Note the polarity:
//! a `1` means "masked", which is the opposite of how most people read a flag called `I`.
//!
//! `msr daifset` / `msr daifclr` take a 4-bit immediate where bit 1 is `I`, so masking
//! IRQs is `msr daifset, #2`. These are single instructions that touch only the bits you
//! name, so there is no read-modify-write window to lose a race in.
//!
//! We only touch `I`. FIQ and SError stay as the boot protocol left them.
