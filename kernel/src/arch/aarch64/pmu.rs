//! **Start the cycle counter, check it counts, and read it** (milestone 74, the aarch64 half).
//!
//! `PMCCNTR_EL0` is the PMU's always-present cycle counter. Until this module it was a **stopped**
//! counter in this kernel: nothing wrote `PMCR_EL0.E` or `PMCNTENSET_EL0.C`, so a thread holding
//! milestone 229's grant could read it legally and got the same number every time. Starting it is a
//! handful of register writes. The rest of this file is what goes around them, and it is the shape
//! `arch::riscv64::pmu` and `arch::x86_64::pmu` already established: check the counter moves before
//! believing it, and record *why* when it does not, as a value the boot line prints.
//!
//! # Why this is a register write and not a firmware call
//!
//! On riscv64 the counters are M-mode's, so the kernel has to ask firmware (SBI PMU). On aarch64
//! the PMU's control registers are directly writable at EL1 once nothing above traps them.
//! `MDCR_EL2.TPM` is the EL2 half of "nothing above", and `boot.s`'s EL2 drop clears it (milestone
//! 127's first prerequisite). `MDCR_EL3.TPM` is the EL3 half and is TF-A's, not ours. **So on
//! aarch64 there is nobody else to blame**: a counter that does not run is this kernel's failure to
//! start it, or a secure-world setting this module can observe but not change.
//!
//! # The registers, per core
//!
//! Every one of them is banked per PE, and every one resets to an architecturally UNKNOWN value
//! (Arm DDI 0487, and the `AArch64-pmcr_el0`, `-pmcntenset_el0` and `-pmccfiltr_el0` pages of the
//! system-register reference at `arm.jonpalmisc.com`, read 2026-09-19). So [`init_this_core`] runs
//! on **every** core from `timer::init`, which is the per-core init site the `PMUSERENR_EL0` write
//! already lives at, and it **assigns** rather than read-modify-writes: a field firmware left set is
//! exactly the thing this is removing.
//!
//! | register | written | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `PMCCFILTR_EL0` | [`PMCCFILTR_PROVISIONAL`] | which exception levels are counted. **Provisional**, and calef's; see below |
//! | `PMCR_EL0` | `E \| C \| LC` | `E` enables; `C` zeroes this core's cycle counter; `LC` makes its overflow 64-bit. `D` (divide by 64) and `DP` (stop when counting is prohibited) are cleared by the assignment, and a set `D` would make every number 64 times too small |
//! | `PMCNTENSET_EL0` | bit 31 (`C`) | the cycle counter's own enable. Write-one-to-set, so no other counter is touched |
//!
//! Linux's `armv8pmu_reset` (`drivers/perf/arm_pmuv3.c`, read 2026-09-19) assigns `PMCR_EL0` the
//! same way, `P | C | LC`, for the same reason. seL4's `arm_init_ccnt` (`src/arch/arm/benchmark/
//! benchmark.c`, read 2026-09-19) writes `E | C | P` and then `PMCNTENSET` bit 31, which is this
//! module minus `LC`.
//!
//! # `PMCCFILTR_EL0` is written with a provisional value, and publishing a number waits on calef
//!
//! Its `P`, `U` and `NSH` bits decide whether cycles spent at EL1, EL0 and EL2 are counted. That
//! decides what every cycle number this kernel ever prints *means*: a count that includes EL1 is
//! comparable to seL4's IPC figures, and one that excludes it is a userspace-only profile. It is a
//! fact that leaves the machine, so it is calef's, and the options are
//! `design/roadmap/proposals/the-aarch64-half-of-74.md`. What is written today is
//! zero, for the reasons [`PMCCFILTR_PROVISIONAL`] gives, and no number measured under it is a
//! result.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Nothing here has run on silicon.** Every outcome this module can report today is a fact about
//!   QEMU. argon (the Jetson TX1, milestone 127) is the machine that would say something, and its
//!   block's bench procedure names what to read on the console.
//! - **The did-it-move check cannot tell a real counter from an emulated one.** QEMU-TCG models
//!   `PMUv3` on every `-cpu` this tree boots (`cortex-a72`, `-a57`, `-a53`) and drives
//!   `PMCCNTR_EL0` from its own clocks, so the counter moves, is accepted as `Running`, and counts
//!   nothing a core did. Measured 2026-09-19: under `-icount` (the bench boot) it is the
//!   instruction count, and the probe reads `cycles_per_tick 16.00 (10000226 cycles over 625003
//!   ticks at cntfrq 62500000)`, which is `script/icount`'s own `instructions_per_counter_tick 16`
//!   plus the handful of instructions between the two reads; without `-icount` it advances in steps
//!   of 1000 at roughly 32 per tick. The defence is the riscv64 half's: the probe prints its inputs,
//!   and a round ratio is named as the tell rather than as the answer. The `Stuck` path has not run
//!   on any configuration here, because no QEMU model this tree boots leaves the counter constant.
//! - **A trap here is a hang or a fault before the banner.** If TF-A leaves `MDCR_EL3.TPM` set,
//!   every PMU register access at EL1 traps to EL3, and the first one is milestone 228's
//!   `PMUSERENR_EL0` write in `timer::init`, not anything in this file. That ordering predates this
//!   module; milestone 127's bench procedure says what the console looks like if it happens.
//! - **Each core's counter is its own.** `C` zeroes each core's counter at that core's init, so
//!   values from two cores are unrelated numbers, and a difference across a migration is garbage.
//!   [`cycles`] reads the current core's; a caller that cannot rule out migration must check the
//!   core did not change, which is what `bench::cycles_per_tick` does.
//! - **The counter is never stopped.** It runs for the life of the boot, the same call the other two
//!   halves make.
