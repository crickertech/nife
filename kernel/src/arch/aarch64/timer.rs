//! The ARM Generic Timer: the preemption source.
//!
//! # Why this lives in `arch/` and not `drivers/`
//!
//! It is not an MMIO device. It is **part of the CPU**, reached through system registers, and
//! every aarch64 core has one whether the board's designer wanted it or not. There is no base
//! address to discover and nothing in the device tree to look up except which interrupt it
//! raises.
//!
//! That is a real convenience and it is why aarch64 kernels can have a working clock before
//! they can enumerate a single peripheral.
//!
//! # The registers
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | `CNTFRQ_EL0` | how fast the counter ticks. **Set by firmware, read by us.** QEMU says 62.5 MHz. |
//! | `CNTVCT_EL0` | the counter itself: a 64-bit number that only ever goes up |
//! | `CNTV_CVAL_EL0` | an **absolute deadline**. Fire when `CNTVCT_EL0` reaches this. |
//! | `CNTV_TVAL_EL0` | a **relative countdown**, which is just `CVAL = CNTPCT + N`. A trap. |
//! | `CNTV_CTL_EL0` | enable, mask, and a read-only "did it fire" bit |
//!
//! `CNTVCT_EL0` is what `Instant` is made of. It never wraps in any timescale that matters (at
//! 62.5 MHz, 64 bits is about 9000 years) and it does not stop when interrupts are masked,
//! which makes it the only honest way to measure a critical section.
//!
//! # Re-arming is not optional
//!
//! The timer is **one-shot**. It counts down, fires, and then sits there with its "I fired" bit
//! set, raising the interrupt line forever. The handler must set a new deadline, and *that
//! write is what lowers the line*.
//!
//! Forget it and the timer fires exactly once and then the machine wedges in a permanent
//! interrupt storm, which looks nothing like "you forgot to write a register".
//!
//! # And re-arming with TVAL silently loses ticks
//!
//! We shipped this bug and then measured it. `TVAL` is a **relative** countdown: writing N
//! means "fire N ticks from *now*". So re-arming with `TVAL = interval` in the handler gives a
//! real period of
//!
//! ```text
//!     interval  +  however long it took to get into the handler and back
//! ```
//!
//! Every tick starts its countdown *late*, and the lateness is never recovered. **The clock
//! runs slow, permanently, and nothing tells you.** Measured under QEMU: 100 Hz configured,
//! ~70 Hz observed. Thirty percent of our preemptions, gone.
//!
//! `CVAL` is an **absolute** deadline: fire when the counter reaches this exact value. Set the
//! next one to `previous_deadline + interval` and the deadlines sit on a **fixed grid**. A slow
//! handler makes one tick *late*; it does not make the next one late as well.
//!
//! This is the difference between a clock that drifts and a clock that doesn't, and it is one
//! register.

// Four accessors below (`ticks`, `missed_ticks`, `uptime_ms`, `interval`) have no caller outside
// this file's own test module on aarch64: the tick handler re-arms from CVAL rather than from
// `interval()`, and the boot banner prints a tick count only on the RISC-V tour. They are each
// marked `cfg_attr(not(test), allow(dead_code))` rather than the whole module being suppressed,
// so a test that stops exercising one is a gate failure instead of silence. (The header comment
// this replaces predicted callers in "milestone 6 and 8", both long since shipped without them.)

/// notes/portability.md anticipate for a new target, arriving early because HVF runs the real
/// core.

/// The **virtual** timer (`CNTV_*`, INTID 27) is the one a guest is meant to use, and it is

    // deadline would mean the handler itself is too slow, which at milestone 6 means threads losing
    // time slices. What it actually measured: the missed-tick delta over five tick periods, with a

    // handler and failed; a whole interval or more was called the emulator descheduled and passed.

    // makes this a deletion rather than a fix. Both were measured by injection on 2026-08-18, on
    // this ISA, against `script/icount` run on the same tree:
    //
    // | handler slow by | this assertion | `script/icount` |
    // |---|---|---|
    // | under 1 period | silent: no miss to classify | fails on the bound, 2,500 instructions |
    // | 1.5 periods | **fails**, correctly, "late by less than one interval" | fails |
    // | 2.5 periods | **passes**, printing "the emulator was descheduled; not this kernel's bug, not failed" | fails: handler 25,001,200 instructions, missed_ticks 32 |
    //
    // The third row is not a false negative so much as a false exoneration, printed, on the worst
    // timer defect this kernel could have. And the middle row is the same band in which milestone
    // 62's acceptance run caught a real host deschedule wearing the slow-handler message twice per
    // ISA (measured at 0.56 and 0.83 of an interval). Inside the band the assertion cannot tell the
    // two apart; outside it, it says nothing or says the wrong thing. No cut fixes that, because
    // from inside the guest a 30 ms handler and a 30 ms deschedule are the same observation.
    //
    // The claim now lives on `script/icount`, denominated in instructions, which the host cannot
    // move: the handler is bounded deadline-to-re-armed at `HANDLER_BOUND` against a measured 1,056
    // with zero variance across 64 consecutive ticks, and `missed_ticks == 0` is asserted with no
    // taxonomy at all. That is roughly 4,000x tighter than "did not exceed one tick period" and it
    // has no second explanation. `miss_detail` survives, now consumed by the drift test's
    // unmeasured-window report. See notes/load-sensitive-assertions.md and
    // notes/instruction-clock.md.
