//! in this path, no firmware to believe, and nothing to parse. `MIDR_EL1` names the part and the
//! `ID_AA64*` space describes what it can do, architected and mandatory and readable at EL1.

//! The decoding is in [`machine_discovery::aarch64`], host-tested against words real parts report. What can only

//! # One of these was already being read, and that is the point
//!
//! `mmu::init` has always written `TCR_EL1.IPS` from `ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1.PARange`, with a comment
//! saying to read it from the hardware rather than guess. It was right, and it was the only one:
//! the 4 KiB granule the page tables are built on and the ASID width `crates/asid` is built on were
//! both simply assumed. They are the same register.
