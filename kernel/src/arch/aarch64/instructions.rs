//! **One function per instruction**: the aarch64 `asm!` that logic calls, kept out of the logic so a
//! proof can replace it. The aarch64 twin of `arch/riscv64/instructions.rs`, which has the full
//! reasoning; this header keeps only what differs.
//!
//! *Name provisional (a lane minted it 2026-09-25, matching the riscv64 file; names are calef's).*
//!
//! # What is here and what is not
//!
//! Most of this architecture's system registers are reached through the `aarch64-cpu` crate
//! (`TTBR0_EL1.set`, `CNTV_CVAL_EL0.get` and the rest), whose `asm!` lives in that crate. Those are
//! not moved here; a harness that reaches one still fails, and stubbing a trait method on a register
//! type is a different mechanism from the one this file exists for. What is here is every `asm!` this
//! tree wrote itself around logic: the two read-modify-writes (`CPACR_EL1`, `ICC_SRE_EL1`) that used
//! to do their arithmetic inside the `asm!` block, and the single instructions beside them.
//!
//! What stays `asm!` outside this file, each a fixed sequence with no Rust logic inside it: the TLB
//! maintenance sequences in `mmu.rs` (barrier, `tlbi`, barrier, `isb`), the `at` + `par_el1`
//! translation probes, the cache-maintenance loops in `sync_icache`, the PSCI conduit call (its
//! instruction must be a literal), the GIC CPU-interface bring-up and acknowledge sequences, the PMU
//! start sequence, `fp::touch`, the register-preservation trap test, and `timer::calibration_loop`.
//!
//! # A stub is an assumption about the hardware
//!
//! A model that replaces a function here is a claim about the silicon, from the Arm ARM, unchecked
//! against any core. Each function's documentation says what a model must honour.
//! notes/kernel-proofs/stubbing-an-instruction.md has the pattern and its caveat.
//!
//! Every function is `#[inline(always)]` and carries its call site's `options` unchanged.
