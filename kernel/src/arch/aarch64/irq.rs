//! The interrupt controller, aarch64: the GIC.
//!
//! This is the arch side of the portable `arch::irq` surface. Portable code (the `Irq` capability's
//! ACK, and from here the interrupt setup) names `arch::irq`, never `drivers::gic` directly, so the
//! driver name stays inside `arch/` where rule #1 (DECISIONS §4) puts it. It is a thin adapter: the
//! GIC does the work, this only gives it an architecture-neutral name. The RISC-V twin is the PLIC.
//!
//! # Two GICs, and this is where the choice is made (milestone 227)
//!
//! A GICv2 is one memory-mapped driver (`drivers/gic.rs`). A GICv3 is two halves: the distributor
//! and redistributors are memory (`drivers/gicv3.rs`), and the CPU interface is system registers
//! (`gic_cpu_interface.rs`, beside this file, because `msr`/`mrs` are architecture code). This file
//! is the one place that holds both versions, so every caller in the kernel (the exception
//! handler, the timer, the scheduler's SGIs, the tests) names `arch::irq` and never a driver.
//!
//! [`init`] decides the version once, on the boot core, from the device tree's `compatible`
//! (`machine_discovery::gic::discover`), then **asks the hardware whether the tree is right**
//! (`Gic::confirm`) before a single configuration write. A mismatch is a panic that names both
//! sides. That is the gate milestone 227's block asked for: the failure milestone 222 measured,
//! a kernel that boots, prints `interrupts ON` and takes nothing, is now a boot that stops and
//! says why.
//!
//! The version is one relaxed byte read per call. It is written before any interrupt is unmasked
//! and never again, so a relaxed load is enough and costs the IRQ path a load and a branch.
