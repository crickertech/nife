// The context switch. Fifteen instructions, and one of them is doing something strange.
//
// # Why this is so much smaller than the trap frame
//
// `vectors.s` saves **all 31** general registers, because an exception can land between any
// two instructions and the interrupted code has no idea it happened.
//
// This is different. `switch_to` is an ordinary **function call**, and the aarch64 calling
// convention (AAPCS64) already says the caller must assume `x0`–`x18` are destroyed by any
// call it makes. So we do not have to save them: the compiler already spilled anything it
// cared about.
//
// What we must preserve is exactly what AAPCS64 promises a callee will preserve:
//
//   x19–x28   callee-saved general registers
//   x29       frame pointer
//   x30       link register: **where to return to**
//   sp        the stack pointer
//
// Twelve registers and a stack pointer, instead of thirty-three. That is not an optimization
// we invented; it falls out of the calling convention, and it is why real kernels have both a
// trap frame *and* a much cheaper voluntary switch.
//
// (No floating-point registers, because the kernel is built `softfloat`. See notes/aarch64.md
// that decision, made at milestone 1 for a completely different reason, means `d8`–`d15`
// simply do not appear here.)
//
// # The strange instruction is the last one
//
//     ret
//
// It returns into `x30`. And by that point, `x30` has been loaded from **the other thread's
// stack**. So this `ret` does not go back to the caller. **It resumes a different thread, at
// the point where that thread last called `switch_to`, possibly a long time ago.**
//
// That is the whole trick. A context switch is a function call that returns somewhere else.
//
// See notes/threads.md.

// call to this same function (or `Context::new`'s synthetic frame, built to match) left as ITS
// OWN sp after this same `sub sp, sp, #96`. So the instant `mov sp, x1` runs, the very same

// point at the very slots that thread's own prior `stp`s (or `Context::new`) put them in. A
