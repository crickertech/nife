// Saving and restoring the FP/SIMD register file, aarch64. The assembly half of fp.rs.
//
// # Why this is not in context.s
//
// `switch_to` saves the AAPCS64 callee-saved set, which is what a *function call* may destroy.
// This is a different quantity: the whole of `q0`-`q31` plus `FPCR` and `FPSR`, because the
// register file crosses a thread boundary rather than a call boundary. The kernel is built
// `softfloat` and executes no FP instruction of its own, so every bit in these registers belongs
// to whichever thread last ran, and all of it has to move.
//
// 512 bytes of register state, 32 store-pair instructions each way. That cost is why `fp.rs`
// arranges for these two routines to be called only for a thread that has taken the enable trap,
// and why they are out of line rather than folded into the switch.
//
// # The `.arch_extension` directives
//
// The kernel's target is `aarch64-unknown-none-softfloat`, whose feature string carries `-neon`,
// so the integrated assembler rejects `q` registers and `FPCR` by default. That is the whole point
// of the target: it stops the *compiler* emitting FP, which is what made a kernel with no save
// path safe. It is not meant to stop hand-written code that saves the file on purpose.
// `.arch_extension fp` and `simd` re-enable the two for the assembler, and the matching `no...`
// directives at the bottom put it back, so nothing after this file inherits the widened set.

// bytes are the `live` flag and its padding, which keeps the vector area 16-byte aligned without
// the caller having to think about it). `FPCR` and `FPSR` follow at 528.
