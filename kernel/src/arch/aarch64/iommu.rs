//! The SMMUv3 driver: aarch64's IOMMU, in front of the PCIe bus.
//!
//! Milestone 16b (DECISIONS §20, notes/iommu.md). The SMMU sits between PCIe devices and memory
//! and translates every address a device emits through per-stream tables the kernel programs. The
//! tables themselves are ordinary VMSAv8-64 page tables built by the portable seam
//! (`paging::domain` via `crate::iommu`); this module owns everything architecture-specific: the
//! register file, the stream table, the context descriptor, and the two in-memory queues the
//! SMMU is driven by (commands in, fault events out).
//!
//! # The shape of the hardware
//!
//! Software talks to an SMMUv3 almost entirely through **memory**, not registers:
//!
//! - The **stream table** maps a `StreamID` (for PCIe: the requester id, bus/dev/fn) to a Stream
//!   Table Entry. The STE says what happens to that device's transactions: abort, bypass, or
//!   translate via a **context descriptor**.
//! - The **context descriptor** (CD) is the SMMU's copy of what `TTBR0_EL1` + `TCR_EL1` + `MAIR_EL1`
//!   are to the CPU: the table root, the size/granule geometry, the ASID, the memory-attribute
//!   palette. Stage-1 translation through a CD walks the same descriptor format the CPU walks,
//!   which is why the `paging` crate builds the tables.
//! - The **command queue** is how configuration changes take effect: the SMMU caches STEs, CDs
//!   and TLB entries, and software pushes invalidation commands (then a sync) to make it re-read.
//! - The **event queue** is where the SMMU reports faults: a device that emitted an address its
//!   domain does not map lands here as an `F_TRANSLATION` event instead of touching memory.
//!
//! # Default deny
//!
//! `init` sets `GBPA.ABORT` (so traffic aborts even in the window before the SMMU is enabled),
//! points the SMMU at an all-invalid stream table, and only then sets `SMMUEN`. From that moment
//! every stream aborts until `attach` writes its STE. A device the kernel never attached cannot
//! DMA at all, which is the loud version of "a device without `iommu_platform=on` silently
//! bypasses": the bypass hole is closed on the QEMU side per device, and the abort default is
//! what the kernel can enforce from its side. See notes/iommu.md for the honest limits.
