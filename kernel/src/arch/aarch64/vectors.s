// Each entry is exactly 128 bytes: 32 instructions. That is enough to save state and
// branch, and not enough to do real work. The constraint is why every aarch64 kernel
// on earth looks nearly identical right here.
//
// See notes/exceptions.md.

// Save the interrupted CPU state onto the kernel stack.
//
// This layout is a CONTRACT with `struct TrapFrame` in exceptions.rs. Reorder a store
// here and the Rust side silently reads the wrong field. There is a compile-time size
// assertion over there, which catches half of the ways to get this wrong.
//
// CFI: see notes/cfi-unwind.md, "The hard case: a trap is not a call". `.cfi_signal_frame` tells
// the unwinder this is not an ordinary call frame (a PC saved here is the interrupted instruction
// itself, not one past a `bl`, which matters for symbolizing it correctly). The GP-register offsets
// below are plain, correct arithmetic on this macro's own pushes and hold regardless of what
// interrupted: a debugger can recover x0-x29 of the interrupted context from any PC inside a vector
// entry. **x30 (lr) is deliberately left `.cfi_undefined`**, not described, even though its real
// value IS saved a few lines down: describing it under DWARF's default return-address column (30,
// the same column ordinary code uses for lr) would tell an unwinder "the interrupted code's caller
// is at this x30 value", which is false. The interrupted code's actual resume point is `elr_el1`, a
// data value, not a register restored by the exception itself, and AArch64 DWARF has a dedicated
// register for exactly this (`ELR_mode`, number 33; see aadwarf64), which this macro also states,
// spec-correctly, in case a future unwinder honours it -- **today's GDB does not**: it hardcodes
// column 30 as the return address column and ignores `.cfi_return_column`
// (sourceware.org/pipermail/gdb/2023-January/050488.html). So leaving 30 undefined is the
// non-misleading choice with the tool this project actually uses; see the BUGS section in the note
// for what that costs.
