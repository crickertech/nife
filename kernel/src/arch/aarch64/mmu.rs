//! Turning the MMU on.
//!
//! # The sketchiest moment in the kernel
//!
//! The instant we set `SCTLR_EL1.M`, **the very next instruction is fetched through the
//! MMU.** If the page currently executing isn't mapped, the CPU tries to fetch from an
//! address that no longer means anything and the machine simply stops existing.
//!
//! There is no fault. There is no message. `println!` cannot help, because the UART's
//! address is also now a virtual address, and if *that* isn't mapped either, there is
//! nowhere for the bytes to go.
//!
//! You get one shot. `cargo xtask gdb` is the tool that exists for this.
//!
//! # Why an identity map first
//!
//! We map every physical address to *itself*: VA == PA. So the instruction after the one
//! that enables the MMU is at the same address it was before, and execution continues as
//! though nothing happened.
//!
//! That is not a stepping stone we throw away. It is **how every kernel on earth survives
//! this transition**, including the ones that end up higher-half. You build a map that
//! contains the code you are currently running, flip the bit, and only *then* jump
//! somewhere else.
