// The kernel's real entry, reached by the `b _boot` in image_header.s.
//
// # We are linked HIGH but loaded LOW
//
// link-aarch64.ld places the kernel at 0xffff_0000_4008_0000 (virtual) but tells the loader to put
// the bytes at 0x4008_0000 (physical). So every absolute address the compiler baked into
// this binary is a virtual address that **does not work yet**, and the code that turns the
// MMU on is inside that binary.
//
// Two facts get us out.
//
// ## 1. `adrp` is PC-relative, so it yields PHYSICAL addresses right now
//
//     adrp x0, __stack_top          // x0 = (PC & ~0xfff) + linker_offset
//
// The linker computes `linker_offset` from *virtual* addresses. But PC is currently a
// *physical* address, and VA - PA is a constant (0xffff_0000_0000_0000), so the two
// differences cancel and we get the physical address of the symbol. Free of charge.
//
// This is why nothing below uses `ldr x0, =symbol` until the MMU is on: a literal pool holds
// the absolute VA, which is exactly the thing that doesn't work yet. (Literal pools holding
// *constants* are fine; the load itself is PC-relative.)
//
// ## 2. Bits 63:48 are not translated, so ONE table serves as both maps
//
// A virtual address `PA + 0xffff_0000_0000_0000` has the same L0/L1/L2/L3 indices as `PA`
// itself, because the index only ever reads bits 47:12 (see notes/page-tables.md). So the
// identity map and the high-half map are **the same table contents**, and we simply point
// TTBR0 and TTBR1 at the same root.
//
// That is the whole trick, and it's why the boot tables below are 2 pages rather than a
// careful dance.
//
// # We may be entered at EL2, and we may be entered at EL1
//
// QEMU's `virt` starts a kernel at **EL1** unless the machine is built with
// `virtualization=on`, and every real aarch64 bootloader this project is headed for starts a
// payload at **EL2**: U-Boot on the Jetson TX1 does, with TF-A's tegra210 BL31 providing PSCI
// below it, and TF-A's Raspberry Pi 4 port does too. A kernel that assumes EL1 writes `TTBR0_EL1`
// and `SCTLR_EL1` from EL2, where those writes configure a translation regime it is not
// executing in, and then branches into a high half nothing maps.
//
// So the entry **reads `CurrentEL` and drops itself** rather than being built two ways. A
// compile-time switch would mean one binary for QEMU and a different one for a board, which is
// the arrangement that produces a defect nobody can reproduce on the machine they have.
// `enter_el1` below is the whole of it, and both entries (core 0 and the PSCI secondaries) go
// through it, because PSCI starts a secondary at the highest implemented non-secure exception
// level regardless of which level called `CPU_ON`.
//
// # The sequence
//
//   0. drop to EL1 if we were entered at EL2 (`enter_el1`)
//   1. park cores 1..n
//   2. set up a PHYSICAL stack (adrp)
//   3. zero .bss (adrp)
//   4. build a crude 1 GiB-block map: device @ 0, RAM @ 0x4000_0000
//   5. TTBR0 = TTBR1 = that map
//   6. MMU on. We are still executing at the physical address, via TTBR0's identity map.
//   7. sp = the HIGH virtual address of the stack
//   8. jump to kernel_main's HIGH virtual address
//
// After step 8, everything is virtual and Rust never has to think about this again.
//

//
// **Not here, and deliberately:** `SCTLR_EL2` is left alone, because the arm64 boot protocol
// requires the MMU and caches to be off on entry and this kernel takes that contract rather than
// re-proving it; `ICC_SRE_EL2` is a GICv3 register and `kernel/src/drivers/gic.rs` speaks GICv2
