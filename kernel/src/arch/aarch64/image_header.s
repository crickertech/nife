// The arm64 Linux Image header.
//
// CFI-EXEMPT: this file is a data structure (a 64-byte header the bootloader reads), not code,
// even though `_start` below is technically entered by hardware. `.cfi_startproc`/`.type ...,
// @function` would claim it is a function with a frame, which would be lying about what it is;
// see notes/cfi-unwind.md. `script/lint`'s CFI check looks for this exact marker.
//
// This 64-byte struct is the difference between QEMU treating us as an anonymous
// blob and QEMU treating us as a kernel.
//
// Milestone 1 shipped an ELF, and QEMU took its bare-metal path: copy the segments,
// set PC, release the CPU, populate no registers. We printed x0 and got zero.
//
// A flat binary carrying THIS header is recognized as an arm64 `Image`, so QEMU
// follows the **Linux boot protocol** instead: it generates a device tree, places it
// in memory, and hands us a pointer to it in x0. Which is what we wanted all along.
//
// The Pi wants a flat image too (`kernel8.img`), so this is on the road to the port
// rather than a detour from it. See notes/portability.md and notes/boot-protocol.md.
//
// Layout, from Linux's Documentation/arch/arm64/booting.rst:
//
//   offset  size  field
//   0x00    4     code0        first instruction. The image entry point IS offset 0,
//   0x04    4     code1        so this has to branch over the rest of the header.
//   0x08    8     text_offset  where to load us, as an offset from the base of RAM
//   0x10    8     image_size   how much memory we occupy, INCLUDING .bss and stack
//   0x18    8     flags        endianness, page size, placement
//   0x20    8     res2         reserved
//   0x28    8     res3         reserved
//   0x30    8     res4         reserved
//   0x38    4     magic        0x644d5241, which is "ARM\x64" little-endian
//   0x3c    4     res5         reserved
