//! ARM semihosting.
//!
//! A debug channel that lets the guest ask the *host* to do things it has no
//! hardware for. We use exactly one call, `SYS_EXIT`, which asks QEMU to terminate
//! with a given process exit status. That is how `cargo test` learns whether the
//! kernel's tests passed (DECISIONS §7).
//!
//! It is worth seeing what this actually is: a trap instruction, an operation number
//! in a register, arguments pointed to by another register, a result returned in a
//! register. **That is a syscall**, and the kernel answering it is QEMU. Milestone 7
//! builds the other side of exactly this shape. See notes/semihosting.md.
//!
//! Requires QEMU's `-semihosting` flag.

// Every item here is reachable only from the test harness (`testing.rs`) and the test-mode arm of
// the panic handler, both `cfg(test)`. So a plain `cargo build` has no caller for any of it, and
// the allows below say exactly that: `not(test)`, not "everywhere". The distinction matters,
// because it means the test build still holds this file to the dead-code gate, and a day when
// nothing calls `exit` any more is a day the gate speaks up.

/// Ask the host to terminate the emulator with `code` as its exit status.

/// `cargo test` interprets a nonzero exit status as a test failure, so this is the
/// whole reporting mechanism.

    // SAFETY: `hlt #0xf000` is the aarch64 semihosting trap. With a host attached it
    // never returns.
    //
    // Without one it raises a real exception, and since VBAR_EL1 is not yet set up we
    // would jump to garbage and die silently. The halt() below would NOT be reached.
    // That is a genuine hole; milestone 2 (exception vectors) closes it. It doesn't
    // bite today only because we always run under QEMU with -semihosting.
