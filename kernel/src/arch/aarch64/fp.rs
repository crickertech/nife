//! **A thread's floating-point and SIMD registers, aarch64.** The register file itself, the two
//! control-register writes that decide who may touch it, and nothing else: the policy that says
//! *when* to move it lives in the portable [`crate::fp`], which is the only caller.
//!
//! # What this architecture gives you, and what it does not
//!
//! `CPACR_EL1.FPEN` is a two-bit field that decides whether FP and Advanced SIMD instructions
//! execute or trap, per exception level. `0b00` traps at EL0 **and** EL1; `0b11` traps at neither.
//! Those are the only two values this kernel uses, and [`enable`] and [`disable`] are the whole of
//! the mechanism.
//!
//! What aarch64 does **not** give you is a dirty bit. RISC-V has `sstatus.FS`, a four-state machine
//! that says in hardware whether the registers have been written since they were last loaded, which
//! is exactly the question a context switch wants to ask. Here there is no such bit, so the
//! question has to be asked a step earlier and coarser: *has this thread ever executed an FP
//! instruction at all?* The answer is recorded in [`FpState::live`], it is set by the trap `FPEN =
//! 0b00` produces on the first such instruction, and it never goes back to false. That is a weaker
//! approximation than RISC-V's and it is the best the ISA offers.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **`live` is a ratchet: a thread that touches FP once pays the save on every switch for the
//!   rest of its life**, even if it never touches FP again. Clearing it would mean knowing the
//!   registers are dead, which nothing here can know. RISC-V's `FS` could do better and this
//!   implementation does not exploit that either; see [`crate::fp`] for why the policy is uniform.
//! - **SVE and SME are not saved, and [`init`] now closes them rather than trusting reset**
//!   (2026-09-24 security audit). `CPACR_EL1.ZEN` and `CPACR_EL1.SMEN` were left at their reset
//!   values, which on every machine this kernel has run on (QEMU's `cortex-a72`, HVF's Apple core,
//!   argon's A78AE) means trapped, and none of those parts has SVE at all. The architecture says the
//!   reset value is UNKNOWN, so a part that reset them open would let a thread keep `Z`/`P`/`ZA`
//!   state that [`crate::fp::hand_over`] neither saves nor scrubs. `init` writes both fields to
//!   trap alongside `FPEN`; on a part without SVE the bits are RES0 and the write is a no-op. A
//!   thread that then executes an SVE instruction takes the same trap FP does, and `crate::fp`
//!   treats it as a fault, because nothing here can save what it would enable. Nothing in this tree
//!   emits SVE. No test can see this on the emulator's default CPU; it is a one-instruction closure
//!   of a window the emulator cannot open.
