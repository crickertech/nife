//! Exception handling.
//!
//! One mechanism serves three purposes on aarch64, and it is worth seeing that they
//! are the same thing before we build the other two:
//!
//!   - a **fault** (bad memory access, illegal instruction)  <- milestone 2, here
//!   - an **interrupt** (the timer, the UART)                <- milestone 5
//!   - a **syscall** (`svc` from userspace)                  <- milestone 7
//!
//! All three suspend the current instruction stream, switch to EL1, and jump to an
//! address the kernel chose. Only the reason differs. Build the plumbing once.
//!
//! See notes/exceptions.md.
