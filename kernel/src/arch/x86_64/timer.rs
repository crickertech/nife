//! **The timer, `x86_64`.** A calibrated TSC for reading time, and the local APIC timer for the tick.
//!
//! # Why this took a calibration loop when the other two took a register read
//!
//! aarch64 has the architected generic timer: `CNTPCT_EL0` counts and `CNTFRQ_EL0` **says how
//! fast**. RISC-V has `time`, and its rate is stated in the device tree. In both cases the machine
//! tells you the number.
//!
//! x86 has at least four clocks and no architected way to ask any of them its rate on the parts
//! this has to run on. `CPUID` leaf 0x15 reports the TSC's ratio to a "core crystal" whose frequency
//! leaf 0x16 may or may not give, and neither leaf exists on everything. The local APIC timer counts
//! the bus clock, which nothing reports at all. So the frequency of the clock everything is measured
//! against has itself to be **measured**, against the one device on a PC whose rate is a fixed
//! number: the 8254 PIT, at 1193182 Hz, unchanged since 1981 because it was derived by dividing the
//! NTSC colour-burst frequency and every clone copied it.
//!
//! # What is calibrated against what
//!
//! A PIT interval of ten milliseconds, timed by polling. Across it, both the TSC and the local APIC
//! timer's countdown are read, which gives both frequencies from one wait. That is deliberate: two
//! separate calibrations would spend twice the boot time and produce two answers that disagree by
//! however much the two waits differed.
//!
//! # Why it is several windows and why the smallest one wins
//!
//! It was one window until 2026-09-21, and one window is wrong by an unbounded amount. Polling can
//! only notice the PIT's terminal count **late**, never early, and the whole TSC delta is then
//! divided by exactly ten milliseconds, so a single host descheduling of the QEMU thread inside
//! the window inflates the stored rate without limit. Measured against a counter known to tick at
//! 1000.000 MHz, one window reported up to **+1153%** and was high on every boot of hundreds.
//!
//! The error being one-sided is also the cure. Every window is an *upper bound* on the true rate,
//! so the smallest of several is the tightest bound taken, and an average would be a biased
//! estimator for exactly the reason the minimum is an unbiased one. [`CALIBRATION_WINDOW_CAP`] has
//! the measured distributions; [`CALIBRATION_AGREEMENT_PARTS_PER`] has why the boot usually stops
//! after three or four windows rather than taking the cap.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The TSC is assumed invariant, and the boot now refuses a part where that is false.**
//!   `CPUID.80000007H:EDX[8]` says whether the TSC keeps a constant rate across frequency and
//!   idle-state changes, and it is one of the three gates `arch::x86_64::isa::init` checks before
//!   this file runs. What remains a limitation is the shape of the answer rather than its absence:
//!   a gate is all that is available here, because the single rate measured below is correct at the
//!   instant it is measured on a varying part too, so nothing in this file could have detected the
//!   problem however carefully it measured. The bit is still untested on real silicon, and
//!   milestone 87 (the `x86_64` bare-metal machine) is where that happens.
//!
//!   **Under QEMU the assumption is now measured rather than assumed, and it holds.** The
//!   `tscdrift` lane compared the TSC against the CMOS RTC, which QEMU drives from host wall time
//!   rather than from the vCPU's clock, over thirty-two-second windows: the rate is exactly
//!   1,000,000,000 Hz and constant to within 42 ppm whatever the host or the guest is doing,
//!   because on an aarch64 host QEMU's guest TSC *is* the host's monotonic nanosecond count. On an
//!   `x86_64` host it is the host's own `rdtsc` instead, so that number does not carry to xenon or
//!   to an x86 CI runner. See notes/tsc-under-tcg.md.
//! - **The calibration is a probabilistic filter, not a bound, and a hard enough host still beats
//!   it.** The one-window design this replaced was wrong by up to **+1153%**; the min-of-N design
//!   above is wrong by at most +0.47% over 200 boots at load 30 on eight cores, with nothing over
//!   +1%. That is a measured distribution rather than a guarantee, and the difference matters: the
//!   minimum is only as good as the best window the host allowed, so a host that never leaves this
//!   vCPU alone for ten unbroken milliseconds produces an inflated rate however many windows are
//!   taken. [`CALIBRATION_WINDOW_CAP`] is the ceiling on how hard it will try. **What makes this
//!   survivable is that the failure is now visible**: the boot line prints the worst window beside
//!   the chosen one, so a calibration the host fought shows a wide gap instead of a single
//!   confident wrong number. A reader who needs the rate to be right rather than probably right
//!   should read that gap, and on a machine that reports `CPUID` leaf 0x15 none of this applies
//!   because the machine states its rate (`arch::x86_64::isa::tsc_crystal_hz`; TCG does not).
//!   Measured by the `calib` lane, 2026-09-21; see
//!   design/roadmap/571-the-x86-boot-calibrates-once-and-can-be-wrong-by-4x.md (the x86 boot
//!   calibrates the TSC once, and can be wrong by 4x).
//! - **Numbers published before 2026-09-21 came from the one-window calibration and are suspect.**
//!   `bench --x86 --real`'s ns/iter, `Instant` and `uptime` through `counter_frequency_protocol`'s
//!   page, and `coremark`'s self-reported rate all read the stored rate, and on x86 every one of
//!   them was scaled by whatever that boot's single window happened to measure. `wait_for`'s
//!   deadlines fail safe (an inflated rate makes a timeout longer in real time, never shorter),
//!   which is why nothing ever went red and why the defect survived. notes/benchmarks.md marks the
//!   affected figures where a reader meets them.
//! - **Under `-icount shift=0,sleep=off` the TSC is not a clock with respect to real time at all**,
//!   and `script/bench --x86` uses that flag by default. Measured against the RTC in one boot, its
//!   rate moved 37% between two workloads (662 MHz while running a register loop, 486 MHz while
//!   running port I/O), because virtual time there is a function of the instruction stream. That is
//!   `-icount` working as designed and nothing here should change to "fix" it; it is a trap only
//!   for a reader who takes those nanoseconds for wall time.
//! - **`now()` is the *calling core's* TSC, and nothing synchronizes or checks the cores against
//!   each other.** This is the one place the three ports are not interchangeable and it is worth
//!   saying out loud: aarch64's `CNTPCT_EL0` and RISC-V's `time` are *system* counters, so a
//!   reading taken on one core and compared against a reading taken on another is meaningful by
//!   construction. `rdtsc` is per-core hardware. Firmware sets each core's TSC at reset and modern
//!   single-socket parts are usually close, but "usually" is the whole of the guarantee here: this
//!   kernel neither measures the skew nor corrects it, and `CPUID.80000007H:EDX[8]` (checked at
//!   boot since the bullet above, and reported absent under TCG) is about rate constancy over
//!   *time* and says nothing about agreement *between* cores. Under QEMU every vCPU derives the TSC from one host clock, so the skew is
//!   exactly zero and no test here can see it.
//!
//!   **What that costs today is a deadline that spans a migration.** `kernel::user::wait_for`
//!   takes `now()`, adds two seconds, and then compares against `now()` again after `yield_now()`
//!   calls that may have moved the thread to another core, so its bound is only as good as the
//!   agreement between those two cores. Milestone 321 looked hard at this as the explanation for a
//!   supervision test that failed on xenon and **ruled it out**, on the evidence that sixty other
//!   `wait_for` call sites passed in the same run; the asymmetry is recorded because it is real and
//!   undocumented, not because it is known to have broken anything.
//! - **The calibration costs boot time, and it is the only one of the three architectures that
//!   costs any.** aarch64 reads `CNTFRQ_EL0` and riscv64 reads the device tree, both of which are
//!   free; this spends 10 ms per window, a measured mean of 35 ms on a quiet host and up to 160 ms
//!   on a host bad enough to reach the cap. `script/test --arch x86_64` boots the kernel **four**
//!   times and those boots took 3, 3, 4 and 3 windows, so the suite pays **90 ms** more than the
//!   one-window design did against a 3m38s runtime: 0.04%, and an order of magnitude below the
//!   suite's own run-to-run variance, which is why that is a computed figure rather than a
//!   measured delta. There is nothing to measure a 90 ms change against.
//! - **The local APIC timer's rate is the minimum over the same windows**, taken independently of
//!   the TSC's rather than read off whichever window was shortest. Both deltas are proportional to
//!   the window's real duration so in practice the same window wins both, and taking them
//!   separately costs nothing and means neither number can be dragged up by the other's outlier.
//!   It has no `CPUID` equivalent, so unlike the TSC there is no path here that skips the
//!   measurement.
//! - **`init` panics if the local APIC is not up.** The ordering (APIC, then timer) is a real
//!   constraint and is enforced loudly rather than producing a timer that never fires.
