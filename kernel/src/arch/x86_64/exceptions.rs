//! **The IDT and the trap path, `x86_64`.** The third implementation of the arch contract aarch64
//! states with `VBAR_EL1` and RISC-V with `stvec`.
//!
//! The shape of the difference is worth naming, because it is what the assembly beside this file
//! exists to paper over. aarch64 has one vector base and sixteen 128-byte slots the hardware picks
//! between; RISC-V has one entry point and a cause register. x86 has 256 independent entry points
//! and tells the handler nothing, so the vector number has to be manufactured by having 256
//! different stubs (trap.s), and ten of the 32 architectural exceptions push an extra word the other
//! 246 vectors do not.
//!
//! What the rest of the kernel sees through this module is the same four things it sees on the
//! other two: a [`TrapFrame`], counters it can assert on, the last user fault, and an `init` that
//! makes faults reportable instead of fatal.
