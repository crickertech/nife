//! **The Intel TCO watchdog**, the one piece of an Intel PC that resets the machine when the kernel
//! stops talking to it (milestone 593 (a wedged kernel resets itself), provisional number).
//!
//! Every Intel chipset since the ICH carries a TCO ("total cost of ownership") timer beside its
//! power-management logic. Software loads a count of 0.6-second ticks, and the timer counts down.
//! A write to its reload register starts the count again, which is the pet. If the count reaches
//! zero, the chipset sets `TIMEOUT`, reloads, and counts again. If it reaches zero a second time
//! with no pet in between, it sets `SECOND_TO_STS` and asserts `PLTRST#`: a platform reset that
//! needs nothing from the CPU. That second timeout is the whole point. A kernel spinning with
//! interrupts off cannot ask for a reset, and this does not wait to be asked.
//!
//! So the reset lands `2 x TMR x 0.6` seconds after the last pet, not `TMR x 0.6`. Linux's
//! `iTCO_wdt` halves the count only on TCO version 1, whose `TMR` is six bits wide; on versions 2
//! and 4 its `heartbeat` is the first timeout, and the reset comes one heartbeat later. This module
//! takes the time to the reset as its argument and does the halving itself, so the number a caller
//! writes is the number that matters to a person at the board.
//!
//! # Two generations, and where each keeps its registers
//!
//! | | ICH9 (QEMU `q35`), TCO version 2 | 100/200-series PCH (xenon's Q270), TCO version 4 |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | found through | LPC bridge `00:1f.0`, device `0x2918` | `SMBus` controller `00:1f.4`, device `0xa2a3` (also `0xa123`, `0x9d23`) |
//! | TCO base | `PMBASE` (config `0x40`, bits 15:7) plus `0x60`; decode needs `ACPI_CNTL` (`0x44`) bit 7 | `TCOBASE` (config `0x50`, bits 15:5); decode needs `TCOCTL` (`0x54`) bit 8 |
//! | `NO_REBOOT` | `GCS`, memory at `RCBA` (config `0xf0`) plus `0x3410`, bit 5 | the `SMBus` `GC` register in private config space, `SBREG_BAR + 0xc6_000c`, bit 1 |
//!
//! The registers inside the TCO block are the same on both: `TCO_RLD` at `+0x00`, `TCO1_STS` at
//! `+0x04`, `TCO2_STS` at `+0x06`, `TCO1_CNT` at `+0x08` (bit 11 halts the timer), `TCO_TMR` at
//! `+0x12` (bits 9:0, the tick count). Sources, read on 2026-09-24: Intel's *200 Series Chipset
//! Family PCH Datasheet, Volume 2* (335193), sections 7.1.17, 7.1.18, 7.3.2, 4.1.6, 4.1.39 and
//! 31.1; Linux `drivers/watchdog/iTCO_wdt.c`, `drivers/mfd/lpc_ich.c`,
//! `drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-i801.c` and `drivers/platform/x86/p2sb.c`; QEMU `hw/acpi/ich9_tco.c`,
//! `hw/isa/lpc_ich9.c` and `include/hw/southbridge/ich9.h`. Intel's ICH9 datasheet (316972) could
//! not be downloaded, so the version 2 column rests on Linux and QEMU agreeing, not on Intel.
//!
//! # `SECOND_TO_STS` is the evidence that survives the reset
//!
//! The datasheet says `SECOND_TO_STS` is cleared only by writing a 1 to it or by `RSMRST#`, which
//! is the resume well's reset and not the platform reset the watchdog itself asserts. So the next
//! boot can read it and know how the last one ended. [`Tco::arm`] reads it before it clears it and
//! reports it, which turns "the machine came back" into "the machine came back *because the
//! watchdog reset it*". QEMU keeps the same register across its own reset (its `pm_reset` does not
//! touch the TCO block), which is what lets `script/soak-test --wedge` check that claim.
//!
//! # Rule 2
//!
//! The driver is a value, not a global: [`find`] reads the chipset's configuration space and
//! returns a [`Tco`] holding the base it found, and the caller holds it. Nothing here keeps a
//! static, so a kernel that never calls [`find`] never touches the chipset.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The version 4 path has never run.** q35 is an ICH9, so the `SMBus` lookup, the P2SB unhide
//!   and the sideband `NO_REBOOT` write execute for the first time on xenon. Each step prints what
//!   it found, so a first bench log says which step disagreed with the datasheet.
//! - **Firmware can hold `NO_REBOOT` set, and then the watchdog counts and never resets.** The
//!   datasheet lets the no-reboot strap override software on version 4, and a BIOS may use it.
//!   [`Tco::arm`] reads the bit back after clearing it and refuses to report armed if it stuck, so
//!   the failure is a line on the console rather than a watchdog that silently does nothing.
//!   **That read-back is not proof, measured.** Under q35 with `-global ICH9-LPC.noreboot=true`
//!   (the strap), the bit reads back clear, this reports armed, and the second timeout never
//!   resets (2026-09-25, `script/soak-test --wedge` failing at its deadline with the wedge on the
//!   console). Only a wedge that comes back proves a machine resets.
//! - **`TCO_EN` in `SMI_EN` is left as firmware set it.** With it set, the first timeout raises an
//!   SMI, and firmware's SMI handler could in principle pet the timer on the kernel's behalf. Linux
//!   clears it only for version 1 by default, and this follows Linux. If xenon's first wedged soak
//!   never resets, this is the second thing to check, after `NO_REBOOT`.
//! - **Nothing halts the timer at boot.** The datasheet makes `TCO_TMR_HALT` default to 0 (counting)
//!   after a platform reset, and it is firmware that halts it. A firmware that does not would reset
//!   an unarmed kernel about 2.4 seconds after the reload value's default of four ticks runs out
//!   twice. Neither q35 nor, by all accounts, a Dell does this; the note is here because the first
//!   machine that does would look haunted.
//! - **The ACPI `WDAT` table, where firmware describes a watchdog for the OS, is not read.** Linux
//!   prefers it when present. xenon's tables have not been dumped with that question in mind.
