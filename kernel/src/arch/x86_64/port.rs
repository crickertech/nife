//! **Port I/O**, the addressing mode x86 has and the other two architectures do not.
//!
//! aarch64 and RISC-V reach every device through memory: a load or a store to a physical address
//! the MMU maps device-typed. x86 has that too, and it also has a second, entirely separate 16-bit
//! address space reached only by the `in` and `out` instructions, with no page tables in front of
//! it and therefore no way for the MMU to grant or deny access to part of it. That is where the
//! legacy hardware lives: the 8259 PICs, the PIT, the CMOS clock, the 16550 COM ports, and QEMU's
//! `isa-debug-exit`.
//!
//! **This is a confinement problem, not just an extra addressing mode**, and it is worth stating
//! before the port needs an answer. A capability system's whole claim is that a program can only
//! touch what it holds a capability for, and on the other two architectures a device *is* a page,
//! so a device capability is a mapping. Port I/O has no page. x86 gates it two ways instead:
//! `RFLAGS.IOPL` (all-or-nothing per privilege level) and the TSS **I/O permission bitmap**, one bit
//! per port, which is per-task rather than per-page and is the only mechanism with the right
//! granularity. Nothing here uses it yet: everything below runs in ring 0, and no user program has
//! been given a port. When one is, the bitmap is where the grant has to be recorded, and
//! `arch::x86_64::segments` is where the TSS that carries it lives.
//!
//! Rule #1 is why these four functions exist at all rather than each caller writing its own `asm!`:
//! `in`/`out` are instructions, so they belong under `arch/`.
