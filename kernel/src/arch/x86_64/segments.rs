//! **The GDT and the TSS**, which have no counterpart at all on the other two architectures.
//!
//! aarch64 and RISC-V have no segmentation. `x86_64` has *almost* none: in 64-bit mode a segment's
//! base and limit are ignored for everything except `fs` and `gs`, so the descriptors below carry
//! essentially no information. What they still carry is the three bits that decide **what mode the
//! CPU is in**: the code segment's `L` bit (64-bit), `DPL` (which ring), and `D/B`. So the GDT
//! cannot be dispensed with even though almost every field in it is dead.
//!
//! The TSS is the part that does real work, and its job is the one x86 gives no other mechanism for:
//! **where does the stack pointer come from when the CPU changes ring?** On aarch64 an exception
//! from EL0 lands on `SP_EL1`, a separate banked register the kernel has already set. On RISC-V the
//! trap handler recovers its stack from `sscratch`. x86 reads `TSS.RSP0` out of memory, so a task
//! that traps in from ring 3 gets whatever `RSP0` says, and if it says something wrong the very
//! first user-mode fault is unrecoverable. The IST entries are the same mechanism with a stronger
//! promise: an IST vector switches stacks **unconditionally**, even for a ring-0 trap, which is the
//! only way to survive a fault whose cause is that the current stack is unusable.
//!
//! # The selector layout is not free
//!
//! `syscall`/`sysret` derive four selectors from two 16-bit fields of `IA32_STAR`, by arithmetic:
//! entering the kernel takes CS = `STAR[47:32]` and SS = that + 8, and returning to user takes
//! CS = `STAR[63:48]` + 16 and SS = `STAR[63:48]` + 8. So the order below (kernel code, kernel data,
//! user **data**, user **code**) is forced by the instruction, and the apparently-backwards user
//! pair is the tell. Reordering these to look tidier breaks `sysret` in a way that shows up as a
//! general protection fault on the way back to a program that did nothing wrong.

/// would write into the current CPU's TSS on every switch-in, sized for the whole port space,
/// **not installed as live**.
///
/// The x86 port space is 16 bits (`in`/`out` address exactly 64 Ki ports), one bit of "may this
/// ring-3 thread touch this port" each, so the bitmap is `65536 / 8 == 8192` bytes exactly (the
/// module doc's "8 KiB" is not a round number picked for convenience; it is what the architecture
/// requires). Some real implementations (Linux's, e.g.) append one further guard byte set to all
/// ones, because the CPU may read two bytes when checking the highest port and a bitmap that ends
/// exactly at the limit would read past it; that byte is not needed here because nothing ever
/// checks this array against a real port access (see below).
///
/// **What this measures, and what it does not.** §121's option 1 would extend the live [`Tss`]
/// with this array, point `iomap_base` at it, and have the scheduler overwrite it on every
/// switch-in. This does the write (the dominant cost the amendment names) without any of the
/// rest: `iomap_base` above still points past the end of `TSS`, `ltr` is never re-issued, and no
/// `in`/`out` from ring 3 ever runs in this benchmark boot (there is no ring-3 program on this
/// port yet; see `user::x86_programs`). So the number this produces is the cost of an 8 KiB
/// per-CPU memory write on the switch path, not a proof that the bitmap enforces anything; that
/// second half is option 1's real implementation, out of scope here (`design/decisions/121-port-io-capability.md`).
///
/// (Milestone 299 built that real implementation; this bench's naive always-write stays as the
/// upper-bound baseline the lazy `tss_iomap_lazy_switch`/`tss_iomap_lazy_nop` read against. It reuses
/// the production [`IOMAP_BYTES`] rather than redefining it.)
