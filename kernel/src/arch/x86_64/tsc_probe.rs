//! **Does the TSC tick at a constant rate under QEMU TCG?** A temporary measurement, not a feature.
//!
//! `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/timer.rs` measures the TSC's rate once at boot and everything
//! time-derived on x86 flows from that one number, while TCG refuses to advertise
//! `CPUID.80000007H:EDX[8]` (the invariant-TSC bit) under any invocation. So nothing on this
//! machine promises the rate is constant, and nothing had ever checked. This module checks, by
//! comparing the TSC against a clock QEMU drives from a different source.
//!
//! # The independent clock, and why the obvious one is circular
//!
//! The PIT is **not** usable as the reference, because `timer::init_frequency` calibrates against
//! it: an agreement between the two would be the calibration agreeing with itself. Worse, in QEMU
//! both the i8254 and the TSC are driven from `QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL`, so they are the same clock
//! wearing two device models.
//!
//! The **CMOS RTC** is driven from `rtc_clock`, which is `QEMU_CLOCK_HOST` by default: host wall
//! time, advanced by a host timer rather than by the vCPU. That makes it the one clock in the
//! machine that is independent of the TSC by construction, and it is the reference here. Its
//! resolution is one second, which is coarse, so this does not *read* it as a time: it watches the
//! seconds register for an **edge** and timestamps the TSC there. The error per edge is then one
//! poll-loop iteration rather than one second, and the loop's own period is measured and reported
//! so the bound is a number rather than an assumption.
//!
//! # What is varied, and why that is the discriminating experiment
//!
//! The hypothesis worth killing first is *where TCG gets guest time from*. If it derives the TSC
//! from host wall time, the rate is constant by construction whatever the guest does. If it derives
//! it from the emulated instruction stream, the rate moves with how fast emulation is going.
//!
//! So alternate windows burn two workloads with wildly different host cost per guest instruction:
//!
//! - **`alu`**: a register-only loop. Many guest instructions, very cheap to emulate.
//! - **`port`**: `out 0x80` in a loop (the POST diagnostic port, ignored by QEMU and by every real
//!   chipset). Few guest instructions, each one a TCG exit into device emulation, so it is orders
//!   of magnitude more host time per guest instruction.
//!
//! Every window ends with the same tight RTC poll, so edge detection is identical across them and
//! only the burn differs. Under an instruction-derived clock the two window kinds report different
//! implied frequencies. Under a host-time-derived clock they report the same one.
