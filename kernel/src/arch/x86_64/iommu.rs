//! **The VT-d driver: Intel's IOMMU, in front of the PCIe bus.**
//!
//! Milestone 16b's role, x86's device (milestone 161, roadmap item 6). The register file, the
//! root/context tables, and register-based invalidation live here; the translation tables
//! themselves are the portable seam's job (`paging::domain` via `crate::iommu`), built in
//! [`paging::x86_64::Vtd`] rather than the CPU's own [`paging::x86_64::Ia32e`] (that module's own
//! doc says why the two must not be confused).
//!
//! # The shape of the hardware, and how it differs from the other two
//!
//! SMMUv3 and the RISC-V IOMMU are both driven almost entirely through memory: a stream/device
//! table the driver writes and queues the driver pushes commands into. **VT-d is driven through
//! registers**, and that is the real architectural difference, not a detail: there is no command
//! queue and no fault queue here, because the *legacy* (non-scalable, non-queued) interface this
//! driver speaks does invalidation with a register write-and-poll (`CCMD_REG`, the IOTLB invalidate
//! register) and reports faults through a small bank of Fault Recording Registers instead of a
//! ring in memory. That interface is what every VT-d unit supports unconditionally; the queued
//! (`ECAP.QI`) and scalable-mode interfaces are supersets this driver does not need yet.
//!
//! Two levels of memory-resident table stand between a register write and a working translation:
//!
//! - The **root table**: one page, 256 entries (one per PCI bus), each either absent or pointing
//!   at a context table.
//! - The **context table**: one page per bus that has an attached device, 256 entries (one per
//!   PCI device/function), each either absent or naming a domain id and a second-level page-table
//!   root, the tables [`crate::iommu::confine`] built.
//!
//! Both tables are allocated **lazily and default-absent**, which is the same default-deny posture
//! `init` gives the SMMUv3 and the RISC-V IOMMU: a bus with no context table, or a context entry
//! with its present bit clear, faults every transaction rather than routing it anywhere.
//!
//! # What is built, against what QEMU's `-device intel-iommu` on `q35` presents
//!
//! **Every DRHD the DMAR names** (milestone 594 (every VT-d unit translates its own devices), provisional number), each with its own root
//! table, and every `attach` routed to the unit the DMAR says owns the device
//! (`machine_discovery::acpi::DmarUnits::owner_index`, VT-d 4.1 section 8.3). Translation
//! enable/disable through `GCMD`/`GSTS`, written the way section 11.4.4 prescribes (read `GSTS`,
//! clear the one-shot bits, change one bit), the root and context tables, register-based
//! context-cache and IOTLB invalidation (global granularity only), and fault detection through
//! `FSTS.PPF` and the first Fault Recording Register of each unit. The firmware's reserved memory
//! regions (RMRRs) are identity-mapped for the devices they name before any unit translates, and
//! stay mapped in every domain those devices are later confined to (section 3.16). Interrupt
//! remapping, queued invalidation and PASID/scalable mode are real VT-d features this driver does
//! not build; see the BUGS section for what each costs and where the next piece would go.
//!
//! # A device no unit owns
//!
//! Section 8.3 requires at least one DRHD per PCI segment and says the `INCLUDE_PCI_ALL` unit
//! takes every device no other unit names, and section 8.4 requires every device an RMRR names to
//! be under some unit. So on firmware that follows the specification, every PCI function has an
//! owner. The specification does not say what the hardware does with a requester no scope
//! covers, because by its own rules there is none. **This driver does what Linux does**: Linux's
//! `intel_iommu_probe_device` returns `-ENODEV` when `dmar_find_matched_drhd_unit` finds no unit,
//! and the device is left out of the IOMMU layer with its DMA untranslated. Here `attach` for such
//! a device writes no context entry anywhere (there is no root table it would be read from), and
//! [`scope_of`] answers `Elsewhere { owner: None, .. }`, so no caller that asks can claim the
//! device confined. The NVMe bench boot's `bypass` rehearsal is that case. Refusing the device
//! bus mastering instead was considered and refused: it would change what a non-compliant
//! machine does without making anything confined, and it would silence the very preflight that
//! reports the firmware's gap.
//!
//! # Default deny
//!
//! `init` zeroes the root table and points `RTADDR_REG` at it before setting `GCMD.TE`, so
//! translation turns on over an all-absent root: every bus faults until its context table exists,
//! and every device on a bus that does have one faults until `attach` writes its entry. There is
//! no window where translation is on and a device is unconstrained by omission, the same property
//! the other two drivers' `init` establishes for their own table shapes.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Only segment 0 is brought up.** A unit on another PCI segment is reported and refused,
//!   because this kernel reads only one ECAM window and so cannot resolve a scope path elsewhere.
//!   No machine this tree has met has a second segment.
//! - **A unit whose scope names only absent devices is still brought up.** Linux ignores such a
//!   unit (`init_no_remapping_devices`); this driver translates it with nothing attached, which
//!   denies nothing that exists. It differs from Linux only when the firmware names a unit whose
//!   register file is not really there, and then `init` panics on the first status poll instead
//!   of carrying on.
//! - **An RMRR that names a bridge is not mapped until the device below it is confined.** Before
//!   translation turns on, `init` pre-attaches the devices RMRR *endpoint* scopes name;
//!   a sub-hierarchy scope would mean walking every function below the bridge, and no machine
//!   this tree has met writes one. [`crate::iommu::confine`] still adds the region to any such
//!   device's domain. Until that confine, such a device's firmware DMA faults.
//! - **The graphics unit translates, and nothing here drives the GPU.** Its only mapping is the
//!   graphics RMRR, so the display engine keeps scanning out of stolen memory if and only if the
//!   firmware's RMRR covers the memory it scans. Linux translates the same unit on Skylake and Kaby
//!   Lake without a quirk (its `quirk_iommu_igfx` list stops at Broadwell), which is the evidence
//!   this is safe; xenon is the first run. notes/risk-6-bench-evening.md says what to watch.
//! - **No interrupt remapping.** `ECAP.IR` is read and *reported* since milestone 317
//!   (the interrupt-remapping flags, and where MSI confinement actually lives) by
//!   [`interrupt_remapping_available`] and the bring-up line `print_summary` writes, and that
//!   is all: this driver never sets `GCMD.IRE`, never allocates an interrupt-remapping table, and
//!   never programs an entry in one. MSI/MSI-X delivery is unaffected either way (this kernel does
//!   not remap interrupts on any architecture yet), but a future PCI MSI driver on x86 would want
//!   to know this is missing before assuming a remapping table exists to program.
//!
//!   **The unit has been offering it all along, which is a correction and not a feature.**
//!   DECISIONS §86 recorded that interrupt remapping is off in every `x86_64` boot this tree runs,
//!   reasoning from the runner attaching `-device intel-iommu` with no `intremap=on`. Reading
//!   `ECAP` from inside the guest says otherwise: QEMU's `intremap` property defaults to `auto`,
//!   which resolves ON with no in-kernel irqchip, so `ECAP.IR` reads set on the default machine
//!   (`0xf00f4a`) and clear only under an explicit `intremap=off` (`0xf42`). Nothing read the bit,
//!   so nobody noticed. `NIFE_INTREMAP=off` (provisional name) is now the way to reach a machine
//!   without the capability.
//!
//!   **What remains unexercised is the whole of the rest.** Nothing here writes an `IRTE`, forges
//!   an MSI, or proves that a remapped interrupt lands where the table says it should. That is the
//!   confinement claim notes/confinement-claims.md carries as stated nowhere, and
//!   design/roadmap/317-interrupt-remapping-flags.md says what it would take.
//! - **Invalidation is global, never domain- or device-selective.** Every `attach` invalidates the
//!   *entire* context cache and the *entire* IOTLB rather than just the entry that changed, which
//!   is correct (nothing survives that should not) and expensive on a machine with many attached
//!   devices, exactly the same trade the RISC-V driver's `IOTINVAL.VMA` with no address makes.
//! - **`RWBF` (`CAP_REG` bit 4) is honoured but has never been exercised.** QEMU's model does not
//!   set it, and neither do the 7040's two units, so the write-buffer-flush branch in
//!   [`invalidate_all`] has run zero times. It waited for `GSTS.WBFS` to be *set* until milestone
//!   594; section 11.4.4 says hardware clears it when the flush completes, which is what it now
//!   waits for (Linux's `iommu_flush_write_buffer` agrees).
//! - **Protected memory regions are switched off, never used.** A unit offering them
//!   (`CAP.PLMR`/`PHMR`, which the 7040's units both set) has `PMEN.EPM` cleared once translation
//!   is on, as Linux does, in case firmware left one enabled. QEMU's model offers none, so this has
//!   run zero times.
//! - **The fault path decodes and clears exactly one Fault Recording Register per unit.** `CAP.NFR` is read
//!   to find where the bank starts, not to size it; QEMU's model reports `NFR = 0` (one register),
//!   so a real unit with more than one is read at the same fixed offset only, and a burst of faults
//!   past that one register overflows silently until `FSTS.PFO` is read (it never is).
