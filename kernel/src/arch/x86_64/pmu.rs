//! **Unhalted core cycles, `x86_64`** (milestone 309, the `x86_64` half of milestone 74's
//! measurement side).
//!
//! # Why this is not `rdtsc`, which is the whole reason the module exists
//!
//! [`super::timer::now()`] **is** `rdtsc`. So a `cycles_per_tick` probe on this architecture that
//! read the TSC at both ends would divide one counter by itself and print an exact `1.00`, every
//! time, on every part. That is milestone 16a's "implausibly exact 100.00" again, except
//! structural rather than emulated: no boot on real silicon would ever fix it, because the two
//! reads are the same instruction.
//!
//! The other two architectures do not have this problem, because on both of them the OS clock and
//! the cycle counter are different hardware:
//!
//! | | `arch::timer::now()` | the cycle counter |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `aarch64` | `CNTVCT_EL0`, the architected generic timer | `PMCCNTR_EL0`, a PMU counter |
//! | `riscv64` | `rdtime`, a fixed-rate reference tick | `mcycle`/`hpmcounterN` via SBI PMU |
//! | `x86_64` | `rdtsc`, **a constant-rate counter** | `IA32_PERF_FIXED_CTR1`, **this module** |
//!
//! `IA32_PERF_FIXED_CTR1` is architectural fixed-function counter 1,
//! `CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.CORE`: cycles the core actually ran, at whatever frequency it was running,
//! not counted while it is halted. That is the same quantity riscv64's `SBI_PMU_HW_CPU_CYCLES` and
//! aarch64's `PMCCNTR_EL0` give, so with this in place the three architectures report the same
//! thing under one name. The TSC cannot answer it: on every part since Nehalem the TSC is
//! *invariant*, ticking at a fixed rate regardless of the core's frequency or idle state, which is
//! exactly what makes it a good clock and exactly what makes it not a cycle counter.
//!
//! # No authority question, and this must not create one
//!
//! [DECISIONS §139 part 3](../../../design/decisions/139-cycle-counter-authority.md) records that
//! `x86_64`'s TSC is already ambient: `CR4.TSD` is clear at reset and this kernel never writes it, so
//! ring 3 can `rdtsc` and the negative half of the cycle-counter grant test skips here with a
//! reason. **This module does not change that and must not.** It enables a counter the kernel reads
//! with `rdmsr`, which is ring 0 only. `CR4.PCE` stays clear, so `rdpmc` from ring 3 still faults
//! and there is no new ambient counter to grant or to revoke.
//!
//! # The interface, from the specification
//!
//! Intel SDM Volume 3B, Chapter 20 (Performance Monitoring), "Architectural Performance
//! Monitoring". Three registers and one `CPUID` leaf:
//!
//! 1. **`CPUID` leaf `0x0A`** says whether any of this exists. `EAX[7:0]` is the architectural
//!    performance monitoring **version**; fixed-function counters arrive at version 2. `EDX[4:0]`
//!    is how many fixed-function counters there are and `EDX[12:5]` how wide they are.
//! 2. **`IA32_FIXED_CTR_CTRL` (`0x38D`)** enables counting, four bits per fixed counter. Counter 1
//!    owns bits 4..7: the low two are "count in ring 0" and "count in ring > 0".
//! 3. **`IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL` (`0x38F`)** is the master switch; fixed counter *i* is bit `32+i`.
//!    Both have to be set, and a counter enabled in only one of them silently counts nothing.
//! 4. **`IA32_PERF_FIXED_CTR1` (`0x30A`)** is the counter itself, read with one `rdmsr`.
//!
//! # Why the `CPUID` gate comes first and is not optional
//!
//! `rdmsr` on an MSR the part does not implement is a `#GP`, and this kernel has no recovery path
//! for a probe that could have asked. The leaf is therefore checked before any of the three MSRs is
//! touched, which is the same discipline `isa::draw_random_seed` keeps for `RDSEED` one file over.
//! It is also what makes this safe under an emulator that models no PMU at all: QEMU zeroes leaf
//! `0x0A` unless its `pmu` property is on, so [`init`] reads a version of 0, stops, and never
//! issues an `rdmsr` that would fault.
//!
//! # Why a counter is checked before it is believed
//!
//! Because a counter can be present and useless, and this module's whole value is saying so rather
//! than printing a number. `arch::riscv64::pmu` learned this from firmware handing back a counter
//! QEMU models as a constant zero; the same shape is available here two ways, and both are
//! detected:
//!
//! - **Stuck.** Read twice across a timed spin and unmoved. A counter of executed cycles cannot do
//!   that on a core that is executing.
//! - **In step with the TSC.** A hypervisor that satisfies the read by handing back the *same*
//!   counter produces a delta bit-for-bit equal to the TSC's over the same window, and a probe that
//!   believed it would print the exact `1.00` this module exists to avoid. Refused, with its own
//!   reason, so a reader can tell "this machine has no cycle counter" from "this machine's cycle
//!   counter is the clock wearing a hat".
//!
//! **The degradation this module must never do is fall back to the TSC.** A probe that quietly did
//! would reproduce the artifact exactly, in a line somebody would later quote as a fact about a
//! machine. There is no fallback path here; [`cycles`] answers `None` and the caller prints a
//! reason.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Nothing here has been run on silicon.** Every outcome this module can report today is a fact
//!   about QEMU. `xenon` (milestone 87, this project's x86 machine) is the one that would produce a
//!   number. It **has** booted nife, on 2026-09-04 under its own UEFI firmware, and stopped in the
//!   mapper at `mmu.rs`'s `AlreadyMapped` before reaching anything this module touches; that cause
//!   is fixed on `main` and the next boot resumes one line further on. So the honest statement is
//!   that this counter has never been read on silicon, not that the machine has never run.
//!   See design/roadmap/309-x86-64-core-cycles.md and notes/x86-uefi-boot.md.
//! - **The in-step check is bit-exact equality, and that is a deliberate under-detection.** A real
//!   core pegged at exactly its base frequency has core cycles and TSC ticks at the same *rate*, so
//!   an approximate band would refuse a legitimate counter on a legitimate machine. Two independent
//!   counters read by two different instructions a few tens of cycles apart do not produce equal
//!   deltas over a ten-millisecond window; one counter read twice does. So equality catches
//!   aliasing and a 1.00 *ratio* alone does not, and a hypervisor that aliased the two with an
//!   offset would pass this check and print `1.00`. The printed line says what it counts, which is
//!   the defence that does not depend on a heuristic.
//! - **The boot CPU only.** These MSRs are per-logical-processor: a secondary that never ran
//!   [`init`] has fixed counter 1 disabled and would read zero. [`init`] runs once, on the boot
//!   CPU, and the one consumer is a single-threaded bench probe. A per-CPU record is real work and
//!   belongs with a caller that needs it.
//! - **The counter is never stopped.** It runs for the life of the boot, which is correct for a
//!   free-running counter only ever read as a difference, and is the same call
//!   `arch::riscv64::pmu` makes.
//! - **`IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL` is read-modify-written, not assigned.** Nothing else in this kernel
//!   programs a performance counter, so the bits preserved are firmware's. Preserving them is the
//!   conservative choice and costs one `rdmsr`; if a second consumer ever appears, the arbitration
//!   between them is its problem to raise and not this module's to assume.
