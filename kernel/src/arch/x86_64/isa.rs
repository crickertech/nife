//! **What CPU is this, and can it run us**, `x86_64`. The third implementation of the arch contract
//! aarch64 answers from `MIDR_EL1` and RISC-V from the device tree plus `mvendorid`.
//!
//! x86 has had one answer since 1993 and it is a good one: `CPUID`, an instruction that returns
//! structured data about the part, including a 48-character brand string the vendor wrote. There is
//! no device tree to consult and no firmware call to make, which makes this the *easiest* of the
//! three rather than the hardest.
//!
//! The decoding is in [`machine_discovery::x86_64`], host-tested against words this machine
//! reports and against words no part reports; what can only happen on the machine is here: the
//! `cpuid` instructions, the record, and the refusal.
//!
//! # Where each gate sits in the boot, and why they are not all in one place
//!
//! Three features this kernel is built on (milestone 524 (the three `x86_64` boot gates)), and they
//! do not sit together because they are not needed at the same time. The rule is the obvious one
//! stated out loud: **a check belongs at the last moment before the thing it protects, and no
//! later** -- except when that moment is before there is any way to say what went wrong, which is
//! exactly the case one of the three is.
//!
//! | Feature | Checked | Why there |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | NX | `boot.s`, before `EFER.NXE` is written | that write is itself the hazard: setting a reserved `EFER` bit on a part without NX is `#GP`, with no IDT, which QEMU shows as a silent reset |
//! | `syscall` | [`init`], six lines before `arch::init` programs the four MSRs | the console is up, so the refusal can be read |
//! | invariant TSC | [`init`], before `timer::init_frequency` measures a rate | same, and see below; this one warns rather than refuses, and the table row in [`machine_discovery::x86_64`] says why |
//!
//! [`init`] re-checks NX rather than trusting that the assembly ran. That is not belt and braces
//! for its own sake: the assembly gate can only halt, and this one can *say what is wrong*, so a
//! reader who somehow reaches Rust on a part without NX gets the sentence rather than a hang.
//!
//! # The third one is a different kind of check, and that is the interesting part
//!
//! NX and `syscall` announce their own absence the moment the kernel uses them. The invariant TSC
//! does not, and no amount of care at boot would find it. `arch::timer::init_frequency` measures
//! the TSC's rate once, against the PIT, and stores it; on a part without
//! `CPUID.80000007H:EDX[8]` the counter's tick rate moves with the core's frequency and idle
//! state, so **there is no single rate for that measurement to be the answer to**. Every check
//! available at boot passes, because the measured value is correct at the instant it is measured.
//! The error appears later, when the CPU changes power state and the stored rate keeps saying what
//! it always said, and it appears as time itself being wrong: a timeout that fires early, a
//! benchmark that reports a number nobody can reproduce.
//!
//! **A wrong assumption cannot be caught by measuring harder.** That is why this belongs with the
//! gates and not with the measurements, and why no calibration loop, averaging, or cross-check
//! against a second clock would substitute for it.
//!
//! **And it does not refuse, which is a finding rather than a compromise.** The first run of this
//! check found that QEMU's TCG reports the bit as zero and will not be persuaded otherwise:
//! `-cpu max,invtsc=on` answers *"TCG doesn't support requested feature:
//! CPUID\[eax=80000007h\].EDX.invtsc \[bit 8\]"* and clears it (QEMU 11, 2026-09-21). It is
//! KVM-only there, and every x86 machine this project runs on is TCG on an Apple Silicon host. So
//! a refusal here would refuse every boot: **the assumption `timer.rs` had been making for a month
//! is one the machine underneath has never promised.** The gate that cannot fire yet says so on
//! its own line each boot, and `Gate::Warn` in [`machine_discovery::x86_64`] carries the promotion
//! trigger.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **One of the three gates does not refuse**, for the measured reason above: the invariant TSC
//!   is `Gate::Warn`, so a part that does not promise a constant TSC rate boots and is trusted for
//!   timekeeping anyway. Nothing here can detect the resulting drift; see the section above for
//!   why. The promotion trigger is a boot on real silicon reporting the bit, which is
//!   milestone 87 (the `x86_64` bare-metal machine), and the change is one token.
//!   milestone 524 (the three `x86_64` boot gates) is the block, and it replaced the pointer that
//!   used to stand here to milestone 161 (the `x86_64` kernel port), which is BUILT.
//! - **The gates are checked on the boot CPU only.** Every secondary replays `boot.s`'s `EFER`
//!   write and runs `arch::init`'s `syscall` MSRs, and nothing re-reads `CPUID` on it. On a
//!   uniform part that is exactly right and the re-read would be noise. On a hybrid part it is not
//!   a theory: Intel's P-cores and E-cores differ in what leaf 7 reports, and an asymmetric
//!   machine is precisely the one where a per-core check would earn its cost. The kernel has never
//!   run on one, and [`machine_discovery::riscv64`] already carries the RISC-V twin of this
//!   problem solved (the intersection over every hart), so the shape to copy exists.
//! - **`RDSEED` is reported and never gated**, deliberately: it is an entropy source, not a thing
//!   the kernel is built on, and a machine without it boots with a different backend offered
//!   (`kernel/src/user/entropy_service.rs`).
