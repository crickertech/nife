//! **A thread's floating-point and SSE registers, `x86_64`.** The register file, the control-register
//! bits that decide who may touch it, and nothing else: the policy is [`crate::fp`]'s.
//!
//! # Four bits, and one of them has a CVE
//!
//! - **`CR4.OSFXSR`** says the operating system knows about `fxsave`/`fxrstor` and about the `xmm`
//!   registers. Clear, every SSE instruction raises `#UD`, which is why this kernel's `-sse`
//!   userspace has been safe until now without any of this existing.
//! - **`CR4.OSXMMEXCPT`** says an unmasked SIMD floating-point exception should arrive as `#XM`
//!   (vector 19) rather than as `#UD`. Set together with `OSFXSR`; a kernel that sets one without
//!   the other reports arithmetic as a bad opcode.
//! - **`CR0.EM` and `CR0.MP`** are the 80387 emulation pair. `EM` must be **clear** or SSE raises
//!   `#UD` instead of the `#NM` this module wants, and `MP` is set so that `wait`/`fwait` respects
//!   `TS` like everything else.
//! - **`CR0.TS`** is the one that matters: set, the next FP or SSE instruction raises `#NM` (vector
//!   7, "device not available"). It is the enable bit here, written per thread.
//!
//! **`TS` is also the mechanism behind `LazyFP`, CVE-2018-3665**, and this module is why
//! [`crate::fp`]'s header says what it says. The vulnerability was not `TS` itself: it was using
//! `TS` to defer the *restore*, so that one thread ran with another thread's `xmm` registers still
//! in the file and the `#NM` as the only thing between them. Speculative execution reads them
//! before the fault is delivered. Here `TS` answers "has this thread ever wanted the unit", which is
//! a performance question, and the registers are always either the running thread's or
//! [`FpState::INITIAL`], so there is nothing behind the trap to speculate at.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **`fxsave`, not `xsave`.** This saves the 512-byte legacy area: x87, `MXCSR`, and
//!   `xmm0`-`xmm15`. A thread that used **AVX** would have `ymm` upper halves that this does not
//!   move, and AVX-512's `zmm` likewise. That is safe today only because `CR4.OSXSAVE` is clear, so
//!   `xgetbv` and every VEX-encoded instruction raise `#UD` and no thread can get into that state;
//!   the day this kernel enables `XCR0`, this file has to grow an `xsave` path with it, and that
//!   coupling is stated here because nothing enforces it.
//! - **`xsave`'s init optimisation is left on the table.** `xsave` records in `XSTATE_BV` which
//!   components are actually in use and skips the rest, which would make the save of a thread that
//!   touched one `xmm` register much cheaper than 512 bytes. `fxsave` has no such thing. Worth
//!   revisiting with the `XCR0` work above rather than before it.
