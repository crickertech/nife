//! **The TSC calibration's estimator, checked where it is a decision rather than a device.**
//!
//! `arch::x86_64::timer` is nearly all `in8` and `out8` against the 8254, which nothing but a real
//! boot can exercise. The one part that is neither is the rule that decides when enough windows
//! have been timed, and it is the part that was wrong: the module shipped for months taking
//! exactly one window and dividing by exactly ten milliseconds, which is an estimator with an
//! unbounded one-sided error and no test could have said so, because there was no estimator to
//! test.
//!
//! So these are in their own file rather than in `timer.rs`, and they come in two kinds. The
//! **estimator** tests feed the stopping rule sequences written by hand, including the ones a real
//! host is too polite to produce, and assert what it decides. The **boot** tests are the two
//! assertions that need a machine: that the windows were actually timed, and that the number the
//! rest of the kernel reads is the smallest of them.
//!
//! **They all run under QEMU rather than on the host**, which is not where this tree would
//! normally put pure logic. `timer.rs` compiles only for `x86_64-unknown-none`, so an aarch64
//! development machine's `cargo test` cannot reach the stopping rule at all without moving it into
//! a crate, and there is no second consumer to justify one (AGENTS.md's rule 7 is about what two
//! binaries must agree on). The marginal cost is nil because `script/test --arch x86_64` boots
//! this kernel anyway. If the rule ever gains a second caller, it belongs in
//! `crates/counter_frequency_protocol`, which already holds `is_plausible` and is the same kind of
//! thing.
//!
//! See design/roadmap/526-the-x86-tsc-calibration-takes-the-smallest-of-several-windows.md (the
//! x86 TSC calibration takes the smallest of several windows) for the measured distributions that
//! chose the cap and the tolerance.

//!
//! - **Nothing here can prove the calibration is accurate**, only that the estimator is the one
//!   intended. Accuracy needs an independent clock, which is `arch::x86_64::tsc_probe` behind the
//!   off-by-default `tsc_probe` feature, and it costs thirty-five seconds of wall clock per boot,
//!   which is why it is an instrument rather than a test. notes/tsc-under-tcg.md is its owner.
//! - **The boot tests cannot fail on a machine that reports `CPUID` leaf 0x15**, because the
//!   stored rate then comes from the part rather than from these windows. No machine this runs on
//!   today does (TCG does not offer the leaf), so the skip has never been taken; it is written as
//!   a skip rather than an assertion so that the day it is taken, the suite says so instead of
//!   going red for the wrong reason.
