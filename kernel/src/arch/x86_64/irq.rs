//! **The interrupt controller, `x86_64`: the local APIC and the IO APIC.**
//!
//! The third implementation of what aarch64 answers with a GIC and RISC-V with a PLIC, and the one
//! structural difference worth knowing before reading any of it: on x86 the interrupt controller is
//! a **pair**, and it is *also* the SMP bring-up mechanism.
//!
//! - The **local APIC** is per-CPU, at a fixed physical address every CPU sees its own copy of. It
//!   receives interrupts, acknowledges them (the EOI), owns a per-CPU timer, and is how one CPU
//!   sends an interrupt to another. There is no PSCI `CPU_ON` and no SBI `hart_start`: a secondary
//!   is started by sending it INIT and two STARTUP inter-processor interrupts *through this device*.
//! - The **IO APIC** takes device interrupt lines and routes them to a vector on some local APIC.
//!   Where it is and which lines it owns come from the ACPI MADT, which `machine_discovery::acpi`
//!   now reads.
//!
//! # What is built here and what is not
//!
//! Built: the local APIC (enable, EOI, the timer's LVT), masking the legacy 8259 PICs, the
//! calibration counter `timer.rs` needs, **the IO APIC's redirection table**, so a real device
//! line reaches the kernel on a vector this module chose, **MSI vector allocation**
//! ([`alloc_msi_vector`], milestone 215), which is how a PCI function's interrupt reaches a
//! userspace driver here, and **INIT-SIPI-SIPI** ([`send_init`],
//! [`send_startup`]), which is what starts a second logical CPU (milestone 161's SMP item; see
//! `arch::x86_64::ap_boot`). The boot tour proves the interrupt-controller half: the local APIC's
//! own timer, and the PIT arriving through the IO APIC.
//!
//! Not built: every redirection entry still targets the boot CPU only, so a device interrupt
//! reaches whichever core booted the kernel regardless of which core is busiest.
//!
//! # The two obligations the tables state and code must honour
//!
//! **The 8259s are still there.** The MADT's `PCAT_COMPAT` flag says so on every PC, and QEMU's
//! `q35` sets it. They are wired, they will raise interrupts on vectors 8..15 (their power-on
//! default, which overlaps the CPU's own exception vectors), and nothing drives them.
//! [`init_local_apic`] masks both before the local APIC is enabled, in that order, because the
//! reverse leaves a window where an unowned interrupt can arrive at a live IDT. **They are masked
//! rather than remapped, and the IO APIC does not coexist with them being live**: the same device
//! line reaches both controllers, so an unmasked 8259 would deliver a second copy of every
//! interrupt the redirection table routes, on a vector that is an exception number.
//!
//! **A legacy IRQ number is not an IO APIC input.** The MADT's interrupt source overrides rewire
//! them, and on essentially every PC the timer's IRQ 0 arrives as global system interrupt 2,
//! because the PIT is wired to the IO APIC's pin 2 while pin 0 carries the 8259 cascade. The
//! resolution is `machine_discovery::acpi::isa_irq_table`, host-tested, and [`record_isa_routing`]
//! is what hands the answer to this module. **Nothing here may take a legacy IRQ number as a pin
//! number**, and the failure mode if it did is the quiet one: a redirection entry armed on a line
//! nothing drives, no interrupts, and no error.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **One IO APIC, and only the boot CPU.** A machine with several IO APICs divides the global
//!   interrupt space between them by `gsi_base`; this takes the first the MADT lists and refuses a
//!   GSI outside its range rather than looking for a second. Every redirection entry is programmed
//!   in physical destination mode at the boot CPU's local APIC id, so nothing is distributed and
//!   nothing is affine to a CPU that does not exist yet.
//! - **The redirection table is written through the boot map's cacheable alias** when the tour
//!   arms a line before `mmu::init` runs, the same as the local APIC's registers already are. It
//!   works on QEMU and on real hardware (the MMIO hole is uncacheable by MTRR whatever the page
//!   tables say), but it is a mapping this code does not control. After `mmu::init` the page is
//!   device-typed by name; see `arch/x86_64/mmu.rs`.
//! - **Nothing masks a routed line on the way out.** A GSI armed by [`enable`] stays armed until
//!   something calls [`mask_gsi`]; there is no owner registry and no revocation, because there is
//!   no driver on this architecture that owns an IO APIC line (a PCI function reaches its driver
//!   by MSI-X instead, and an MSI has no line to mask).
//! - **An MSI vector is never handed back.** [`alloc_msi_vector`] is a bump counter, so a device
//!   brought up twice (which the test suite does) consumes two of the sixty-three in the band. It
//!   has not run out, and a free list with no free path would be machinery nothing calls; the
//!   number to watch is the count of `find_*_device` calls in one boot.
//! - **Interrupt remapping is not implemented, and this code assumes it is off.** A VT-d unit with
//!   remapping enabled reinterprets a write to `0xfee0_0000..0xfef0_0000` as an index into a
//!   remapping table, and the message [`alloc_msi_vector`] builds is a *compatibility-format*
//!   message that such a unit rejects. `scripts/qemu-runner-x86_64.sh` runs `-device intel-iommu`
//!   without `intremap=on`, and firmware leaves it off by default, so this holds today on QEMU and
//!   is the thing to check first if MSI stops arriving on a machine whose firmware turns it on.
//!   The fix is a remapping table plus remappable-format messages, and it is a milestone rather
//!   than a patch.
//! - **Nothing distributes MSI vectors across cores.** Every message is addressed to the local
//!   APIC id of whichever core ran [`alloc_msi_vector`], which is the boot core, exactly as
//!   [`route_gsi`]'s destination is.
//! - **The multi-IO-APIC path has never been executed, and cannot be on any machine this project
//!   owns.** This is the live half of what milestone 304 found and milestone 308 fixed, and it is
//!   recorded rather than closed because the fix landing is not the same thing as the fix running.
//!
//!   The defect, for the record: [`gsi_vector`] was `GSI_VECTOR_BASE.wrapping_add(gsi as u8)`, and
//!   [`MAX_REDIRECTION_ENTRIES`]'s doc named the cap as the reason that could not wrap onto an
//!   exception vector. The cap bounds the *entry count*, not the GSI. [`redirection_index`] admits
//!   any `gsi` in `base..base + entries`, so a second IO APIC owning global interrupts from 200
//!   with the 24 entries every real part has admits GSI 210, and `0x30 + 210 = 0x102` wrapped to
//!   vector **2, the NMI**, which [`enable`] passed straight to [`route_gsi`]. Nothing had hit it
//!   because this kernel records one IO APIC and QEMU's q35 and every single-socket PC give it
//!   base 0. Milestone 308 routes by redirection index instead, which is bit-for-bit identical
//!   wherever the base is zero.
//!
//!   **So the correctness of the nonzero-base path rests on the proof and on the ACPI spec, not on
//!   a boot** (accepted, calef, 2026-09-16). `proofs::an_owned_gsi_routes_inside_the_io_apic_band`
//!   states it over every base, entry count and GSI, with no assumption, and
//!   `tests::a_gsi_on_a_second_io_apic_routes_inside_the_band` executes the arithmetic against a
//!   synthetic second part; neither is a machine delivering an interrupt through a second IO APIC,
//!   and nothing in this tree will be until one exists to boot on. What is untested is the whole
//!   surrounding path rather than the map: `read_madt` keeps only the first IO APIC it finds, so a
//!   GSI belonging to the second is refused by [`route_gsi`] rather than misrouted, and a machine
//!   that needs both is not merely unproven here, it is unimplemented. That is the thing to check
//!   first when this kernel meets a two-socket server, and it is its own piece of work.

/// destination, no redirection, the same policy [`route_gsi`] takes and for the same reason.
