# The kernel's real entry on x86_64, and the 32-bit -> 64-bit -> higher-half transition.
#
# This file is written in INTEL syntax, because that is what Rust's `global_asm!` selects by default
# on x86 and the alternative is an `options(att_syntax)` this kernel would then have to remember
# everywhere. The other two architectures' boot.s have no such choice to make.
#
# HOW WE GET HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT MULTIBOOT. The obvious answer for `-kernel` on x86 is
# Multiboot 1, and it does not work for a 64-bit kernel: QEMU's loader recognises the header, then
# refuses the image with "Cannot load x86-64 image, give a 32bit one", because the Multiboot 1
# specification says the OS image is ELF32 and QEMU enforces it. Multiboot 2 lifts that restriction
# and QEMU 11 does not implement Multiboot 2 (its x86 loader is one file, hw/i386/multiboot.c, and
# it is version 1 only; checked by inspecting the binary for a version-2 code path, 2026-08-23).
# The header is fatal rather than ignored, so an image cannot carry both and fall back.
#
# So this kernel boots by **PVH**, the direct-boot protocol Xen defined and QEMU, Firecracker and
# cloud-hypervisor all implement. Its entire interface is one ELF note: name "Xen", type
# XEN_ELFNOTE_PHYS32_ENTRY (18), whose descriptor is the physical address to enter at. QEMU finds it
# by walking the PT_NOTE program headers, loads the ELF by p_paddr as usual, and jumps to that
# address **in 32-bit protected mode with paging off**: eax = 0x336EC578, ebx = the physical address
# of a `struct hvm_start_info`, CS/DS flat 4 GiB, interrupts disabled, no valid stack.
#
# PVH is a better fit than Multiboot for this kernel quite apart from the ELF64 question, and the
# reason is what rides in ebx. `hvm_start_info` carries the memory map **and the RSDP address**,
# which is the root of the ACPI tables: on the other two architectures the equivalent single pointer
# is the device tree, and ACPI is what x86 has instead. One pointer in, everything discoverable from
# it, exactly the shape `kernel_main(dtb)` already has.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT BOOT. PVH is a hypervisor protocol. A real machine's firmware does not speak it,
# so milestone 87's OptiPlex will need either a UEFI stub or GRUB's Multiboot (which enters in the
# same 32-bit protected mode this trampoline already expects, so the trampoline itself carries over
# unchanged; only the header and the ebx contract differ). See notes/x86-port.md's BUGS.
#
# That entry mode is the whole reason this file is three times the size of its RISC-V twin. RISC-V
# and aarch64 are entered in the width they run in, so their boot code can be linked high and use
# PC-relative addressing until the MMU comes on. A 32-bit instruction stream cannot name a 64-bit
# address at all, so the trampoline below is linked LOW (VA == PA, the `.boot` output section in
# link-x86_64.ld) and only the second half of this file lives at the high addresses the rest of the
# kernel is linked for.
#
# THE ORDER, AND WHY EACH STEP CANNOT MOVE:
#
#   1. Zero the boot page tables. They are NOLOAD, so nothing has zeroed them, and PML4/PDPT entries
#      we do not write must read as not-present or the CPU walks into garbage.
#   2. Fill them: 4 GiB identity-mapped with 2 MiB pages, the first GiB aliased at KERNEL_VA_BASE
#      (where the image is linked), and the same 4 GiB aliased again at DIRECT_MAP_BASE (where
#      `mmu::phys_to_virt` points). The identity half is not a convenience, it is what keeps
#      `mov cr0, eax` from being the last instruction ever fetched: paging comes on between one
#      instruction and the next, and the next one's address is still low. The direct map is not a
#      convenience either; see step 2e for why it has to exist before Rust runs.
#   3. CR4.PAE, then CR3, then EFER.LME, then CR0.PG. The CPU only enters long mode when PG is set
#      *while* LME is set and PAE is on; any other order either faults or silently enters 32-bit
#      paging, which then walks our 4-level table as a 3-level one and triple-faults.
#   4. A far jump through a 64-bit code descriptor. Setting LME+PG puts the CPU in COMPATIBILITY
#      mode, not 64-bit mode; the L bit in the code segment is what actually widens it, and the only
#      way to load CS is a far transfer.
#   5. Only then jump to the high alias, and only then touch an absolute symbol from the rest of the
#      image.
#
# This is the single sketchiest moment in the x86_64 port, and it fails silently: a wrong page table
# means the instruction after `mov cr0, eax` is fetched through a broken mapping, the CPU takes a
# page fault with no IDT, escalates to a double fault with no IDT, and triple-faults, which on QEMU
# is a machine reset with no output. `-d int,cpu_reset -no-reboot` is how you see it. See
# notes/x86-port.md.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The PVH entry note. This is the whole boot header: four words that tell the loader where to jump.
#
# It has to end up in a **PT_NOTE program header**, because that is what QEMU walks; a note sitting
# in a PT_LOAD segment is invisible to it. The link script therefore gives `.note.Xen` its own
# output section (SHT_NOTE, allocated), which is what makes lld emit the PT_NOTE, and does NOT sweep
# it into the `/DISCARD/` rule that drops every other `.note*`.

# The secondary-CPU entry (milestone 161's SMP item): a real-mode trampoline, linked at the fixed
# low physical address AP_TRAMPOLINE_PHYS (link-x86_64.ld) rather than at this file's usual high
# addresses, because a STARTUP IPI's vector can only name a physical PAGE below 1 MiB and the target
# CPU begins executing there in 16-bit real mode (cs = vector << 8, ip = 0, so the physical address
# is exactly vector << 12).
#
# `secondary_boot`'s VIRTUAL address (VMA) IS its final execution address: link-x86_64.ld gives
# `.ap_trampoline` an explicit low VMA but leaves its LOAD address (LMA) wherever the image
# naturally places its bytes, so at boot they sit somewhere ordinary (beside `.rodata`) and
# `arch::x86_64::ap_boot::prepare` copies them here, to AP_TRAMPOLINE_PHYS, before the first
# `STARTUP` IPI ever fires. Because the VMA already matches, every absolute address the assembler
# baked into this code (this file's OWN tiny GDT pointer below, and both far-jump targets) is
# already correct the instant the copy lands; only the one genuinely dynamic value
# (`ap_trampoline_stack_top`) needs writing at runtime, and `prepare` writes it.
#
# THE SHAPE, THREE MODES IN ONE FUNCTION, no stack used anywhere in it (matching `_start`'s own
# steps 3-4, which this deliberately mirrors rather than jumps into: `_start`'s continuation is
# `_start_high`, which zeroes `.bss` and calls `kernel_main`, and neither is what a second core
# should do):
#
#   1. 16-bit real mode: `cli`, zero the segment registers (their post-SIPI value is UNDEFINED, and
#      every memory operand below is `[disp16]`, i.e. DS-relative, so DS must be exactly 0 for a
#      disp16 equal to this trampoline's own low VMA to name the right byte), load THIS file's own
#      tiny 32-bit-flat GDT (a 16-bit real-mode `lgdt` cannot reach `_start`'s `boot_gdt`, which is
#      linked near 1 MiB, well past what a zero-based 16-bit displacement can address), set
#      `CR0.PE`, and far-jump into 32-bit protected mode. The far jump is hand-encoded, as
#      `_start`'s is, and for the same reason (assembler Intel-syntax quirks); it is the 16-bit
#      *ptr16:16* form here (`EA iw iw`), not `_start`'s 32-bit *ptr16:32* form, because the default
#      operand size is still 16 here.
#   2. 32-bit protected mode: **from here, ordinary flat 32-bit addressing reaches every low-physical
#      symbol in this image**, including `_start`'s own `boot_pml4` and `boot_gdt_pointer` (already
#      built once by the boot core and never freed: `.boot_scratch` is on the frame allocator's
#      forbidden list for the whole life of the machine). Replays `_start`'s own PAE/CR3/LME/NXE/
#      PG/WP sequence verbatim, against the SAME page tables, then `lgdt`s `_start`'s real
#      `boot_gdt` (which has the 64-bit code descriptor this trampoline's own tiny GDT does not) and
#      far-jumps into long mode, exactly as `_start` does.
#   3. 64-bit long mode: reload the flat data selectors, set `rsp` from `ap_trampoline_stack_top`
#      (read RIP-relative: still executing at the low VMA here, referencing another symbol in the
#      same low blob), read this CPU's own local APIC id via `CPUID` leaf 1 `EBX[31:24]` (the same
#      "Initial APIC ID" `arch::boot_cpu_id` reads on the boot core, so the logical id this hands to
#      `secondary_main` agrees with the roster's own seating), and jump to `secondary_main`'s HIGH
#      virtual address. That address is reachable through `boot_pml4` because `_start`'s own high
#      alias (`boot_pdpt_high[510]`) covers the whole kernel image, which is well under the 1 GiB it
