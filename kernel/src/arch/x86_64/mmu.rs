//! **The MMU, `x86_64`.** The third implementation of the seam milestone 20 built: `crates/paging`
//! owns the level walk and `paging::x86_64::Ia32e` owns the entry format, and this module is the
//! glue that names `CR3`, the direct map, and where this machine's devices are.
//!
//! # Two bases, which is the one structural difference of the three architectures
//!
//! aarch64 and RISC-V put the kernel image and the direct map at a single base, so one constant and
//! one subtraction serve both. `x86_64` cannot: `x86_64-unknown-none` uses `code-model: kernel`,
//! which promises LLVM that every symbol is in the **top 2 GiB**, so the image is pinned at
//! [`KERNEL_VA_BASE`] (`0xffffffff80000000`) and there is no room above it to name more than 2 GiB
//! of physical memory. `VA = PA | KERNEL_VA_BASE` was therefore never going to reach a real
//! machine's RAM, and it is not even invertible above the line: the local APIC at `0xfee00000` maps
//! to a distinct address whose inverse is not `0xfee00000`.
//!
//! So the two jobs that constant was doing are split, exactly as Linux splits them (milestone 161,
//! item 1 of the roadmap's open list):
//!
//! | What | Base | Who needs it there |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | The kernel **image** | [`KERNEL_VA_BASE`] `0xffffffff80000000` | the code model, non-negotiably |
//! | The **direct map** of physical memory | [`DIRECT_MAP_BASE`] `0xffff888000000000` | [`phys_to_virt`], and it has room for 64 TiB |
//!
//! They are separate PML4 entries (511 and 273), so nothing about them interferes, and both are
//! canonically high, so `Ia32e::in_half(Half::High, ..)` admits both by the same bit-47 test. The
//! `paging` crate needed no change for either, which is milestone 20's claim holding a second time.
//!
//! [`phys_to_virt`] is the direct map's arithmetic and [`virt_to_phys`] inverts **both** bases,
//! because the kernel asks it about image addresses (`memory::image_start`, linker symbols) as well
//! as about direct-map ones. That two-branch shape is Linux's `__pa()`, for the same reason.
//!
//! # Why `boot.s` installs the direct map, and not this module
//!
//! The roadmap flagged one hazard here and it is real: `phys_to_virt` must not change meaning under
//! anything that already used it. The frame allocator's bitmap is the sharp case, because
//! `memory::bring_up_page_frames` turns a physical address into a `&'static mut [u8]` and **stores it**,
//! long before there is a fine map; the PVH structure and the ACPI tables are read the same way.
//!
//! Rather than sequence around that (map the old alias too, switch, then drop it), `boot.s` gives
//! the boot tables a PML4[273] entry pointing at the same low PDPT the identity map uses. The
//! direct map therefore exists from before the first Rust instruction, covering the low 4 GiB, and
//! [`init`] widens it rather than introducing it. **`phys_to_virt` means one thing for the
//! machine's whole life**, so the hazard stops existing instead of being documented for the next
//! reader to remember. The cost is one PML4 entry and no memory at all.
//!
//! What [`init`] *does* drop is the identity map, which was a complete alias of physical memory
//! sitting in the half user programs will get.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The direct map is built out of 4 KiB leaves**, because the shared `Mapper` maps 4 KiB pages
//!   and nothing else. That is 8 bytes of page table per 4 KiB of physical memory, or 0.2% of RAM:
//!   512 KiB of tables for QEMU's 256 MiB, and ~64 MiB on a 32 GiB machine. Linux uses 2 MiB and
//!   1 GiB leaves for exactly this map. Fixing it is a change to `crates/paging` (a leaf size in
//!   the format trait) that all three architectures would want, not an x86 patch.
//!
//! - **`mmu::init` must allocate its page tables from the low 4 GiB**, because that is all the boot
//!   tables' direct map reaches and the mapper writes every table through it. The frame allocator
//!   hands out the lowest free frame first, so this holds today on any machine; a machine whose RAM
//!   *starts* above 4 GiB would fault inside `map_everything`. Widening the boot map to 1 GiB
//!   leaves (one PDPT covers 512 GiB) is the fix, and it needs a `CPUID` check for `PDPE1GB`.
//!
//! - **`CR4.PGE` is off, so the `G` bit the kernel's `Flags` set is ignored.** Every `mov cr3`
//!   therefore flushes the whole TLB, which is correct and slow. It stays off through roadmap item
//!   3 on purpose: nothing here switches address spaces often enough to measure yet, so turning it
//!   on would be a change whose benefit could only be asserted. When it is turned on it has to be
//!   *after* the fine map is installed, or the boot map's non-global entries are the ones that get
//!   pinned.
//!
//! - **`CR4.PCIDE` is off, so an address space has no hardware tag.** `crates/asid` hands every
//!   space a number and this architecture has nowhere to put it: PCID is `CR3[11:0]`, and with
//!   PCIDE clear those bits are reserved-zero rather than a tag. [`ttbr0_value`] therefore drops the
//!   number and [`flush_asid`] flushes the whole TLB rather than one space's entries. Both say so in
//!   their own words; neither pretends to a selectivity the hardware does not have. Same reason as
//!   PGE above: there is nothing to measure it against yet.
//!
//! - **The cacheable fill follows the firmware's map only as far as that map describes memory
//!   *contiguously*** ([`firmware_fill_ceiling`]). That is a claim about how firmware writes
//!   memory maps, not an architectural guarantee: DRAM and the carve-outs taken out of it abut
//!   each other, and the 32-bit MMIO hole above them is a gap. A machine whose map had an
//!   undescribed gap *inside* low DRAM, with ACPI tables above it, would have those tables left
//!   out of the direct map and would fault reading one. No map in this tree has that shape and
//!   xenon's does not (`notes/x86-uefi-boot.md` transcribes it). The bound it replaced was "the
//!   top of RAM", which was the same number on every machine whose RAM ends below the hole and
//!   swallowed every MMIO window on the first machine whose RAM does not.
//!
//! - **An aperture that firmware reports as usable RAM would panic, and that is deliberate.** It
//!   was the leading hypothesis for the 2026-09-05 `AlreadyMapped` and it was wrong: xenon's
//!   framebuffer is in the MMIO hole, in no RAM region. If a machine ever did report both, the fix
//!   is to exclude the aperture from the RAM direct map *and* from the frame allocator, not to
//!   skip the second mapping and not to remap the frames device-typed. Skipping leaves the
//!   aperture cacheable, and this architecture leaves the effective memory type **undefined** when
//!   one frame is reachable through two mappings with conflicting types, so that is wrong rather
//!   than merely slow. Remapping would give one correct mapping and leave the allocator handing
//!   out frames the display adapter answers at. Until a machine forces the question, the panic
//!   names both ranges and is the better answer.
