# The x86_64 context switch and the first-run trampolines (the asm half of context.rs).
#
# Intel syntax, like the rest of this architecture's assembly.
#
# WHAT A CONTEXT IS HERE. The System V AMD64 ABI's callee-saved set is rbx, rbp, r12, r13, r14 and
# r15: six registers, against RISC-V's thirteen and aarch64's twelve. Everything else is the
# compiler's to spill, so a switch that saves those six and the return address has saved everything
# that can outlive a call. The saved stack pointer is the context pointer itself, so it is not a
# field, exactly as on the other two.

# void switch_to(Context **prev_context, Context *next_context)
#
# rdi = where to store OUR context pointer, rsi = the context to resume.
#
# The last instruction returns to a DIFFERENT thread: `ret` pops the return address that thread
# pushed when it was switched away from (or, for a thread that has never run, the trampoline address
# context.rs put there).
# CFI (see notes/cfi-unwind.md, and arch/aarch64/context.s's CFI note for the full argument, which
# applies unchanged here). One continuous frame description, no special handling at the `mov rsp,
# rsi` stack swap: the CFA formula is in terms of the CURRENT rsp, and `next_context` (rsi) is by
# construction the exact rsp another thread's own earlier call to this function (or
# `Context::for_*_thread`'s synthetic frame, context.rs) left after these same six pushes. The
# return address needs no special rule either: it is always at CFA-8 by the ordinary x86-64
# convention, which stays true across the swap for the same reason the six GP-register offsets do.

# The first-run landing pad for a KERNEL thread.
#
# `Context::for_kernel_thread` put the closure pointer in rbx and the monomorphized call shim in
# rbp, because those are two of the six registers the switch restores. The closure's concrete type
# was erased, so the address says *where* and the shim says *how*.
#
# rsp is 16-byte aligned here by construction (see context.rs's alignment note), which is what the
# `call` below requires.
# CFI: never reached by `call`, this is the fake return address `Context::for_kernel_thread`
# writes into a synthetic switch frame, so `switch_to`'s `ret` lands here the first time this
# thread runs; the return address `ret` used is this function's own, not a real caller.
# `.cfi_undefined` on the return column (rip) says so; the `xor rbp, rbp` below is the same fact
# again, in the frame-pointer convention this ISA also has ("the bottom of the backtrace").

# The first-run landing pad for a USER thread. rbx = entry, rbp = user stack pointer,
# r13..r15 = the child's first three arguments.
#
# THE REGISTERS HERE WERE WRONG UNTIL MILESTONE 161 AND NOTHING COULD HAVE CAUGHT IT. This read
# r12, r13 and r14 while `Context::for_user_thread` wrote r13, r14 and r15, so a child would have
# received (0, arg0, arg1) and arg2 would have vanished. Both files were internally consistent and
# neither was executed: this port had no way to enter ring 3 until item 3 of its roadmap, so the
# only witness would have been a user program reading its own arguments. It is corrected against
# context.rs, whose per-field doc comments are the more specific of the two records.
#
# It is STILL not executed: this trampoline is the scheduler's entry path, and the scheduler has not
# been brought up on this architecture (roadmap item 4). The ring-3 self test enters through
# `enter_user` directly and does not pass here.
#
# RESERVE THE TRAP FRAME BEFORE THE FIRST RUST FRAME EXISTS (milestone 71's fix, carried across for
# parity; the other two ISAs each have this line and the reasoning in full). We arrive with
# rsp = the kernel stack top, and `user::enter_frame` puts this thread's TrapFrame at top - 176,
# where every trap from ring 3 will rebuild it (`TSS.RSP0` = top). Without this the entry path's own
# frames start at the same top and overlap the region `frame.write` is about to fill. 176 is
# size_of::<TrapFrame>(), asserted in exceptions.rs, and a multiple of 16 so rsp stays aligned for
# the `call` below.
# CFI: same fake-frame reasoning as thread_trampoline above.
