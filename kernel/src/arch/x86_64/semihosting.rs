//! **Asking the host to terminate, `x86_64`.** The test harness's exit path.
//!
//! The module keeps the aarch64 name (`arch::semihosting::exit`) because it is the arch contract the
//! test harness calls, exactly as the RISC-V one does, and like that one the mechanism has nothing
//! to do with ARM semihosting. Here it is QEMU's `isa-debug-exit` device: a write of any width to
//! its I/O port terminates the guest with status `(value << 1) | 1`.
//!
//! **That encoding is why the codes below look odd, and it is a real constraint rather than a
//! quirk to route around.** Every exit status this device can produce is ODD, so exit code 0 is
//! unreachable: "success" has to be some agreed non-zero number, and the runner is what maps it
//! back. `0` written to the port yields host status 1; `1` yields 3. This module therefore reports
//! **3** for success and anything else for failure, and `scripts/qemu-runner-x86_64.sh` carries the
//! matching translation. Getting this backwards produces a suite that passes when it fails, which
//! is the one failure mode a test harness must not have, so both halves name the number.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A real machine has no `isa-debug-exit`.** Milestone 87's `OptiPlex` will need the same answer
//!   the VisionFive 2 needed: print a fixed marker line the serial harness can read, then power
//!   down (ACPI S5 rather than SBI SRST). Nothing here does that yet, so a test build run on real
//!   x86 hardware would write to a port nothing answers and fall through to the halt loop.
