//! **One function per instruction**: the `x86_64` `asm!` that logic calls, kept out of the logic so a
//! proof can replace it. The `x86_64` twin of `arch/riscv64/instructions.rs`, which has the full
//! reasoning; this header keeps only what differs.
//!
//! *Name provisional (a lane minted it 2026-09-25, matching the riscv64 file; names are calef's).*
//!
//! # What is here and what is not
//!
//! This port was already mostly contained: `port.rs` is its `in`/`out`, `mod.rs` has `rdmsr` and
//! `wrmsr` as functions, and `interrupts.rs` is `pushfq`/`cli`/`sti` one per function. What moved
//! here are the control-register accesses, which were written out at eleven sites across four files,
//! some of them inside the logic that edits the register (`CR4.SMEP`, `CR4.PCE`), plus `clts`,
//! `invlpg`, `hlt`, `sfence` and the `rsp` read.
//!
//! What stays `asm!` elsewhere, on purpose: `lidt` and the GDT reload (each a fixed sequence over a
//! descriptor in memory), `int3` in the breakpoint self-test, the `rdseed` retry loop in `isa.rs`,
//! and `fp::touch`.
//!
//! # A stub is an assumption about the hardware
//!
//! A model that replaces a function here is a claim about the silicon, from the Intel SDM, unchecked
//! against any core. Each function's documentation says what a model must honour.
//! notes/kernel-proofs/stubbing-an-instruction.md has the pattern and its caveat.
//!
//! Every function is `#[inline(always)]` and carries its call site's `options` unchanged.
