# The x86_64 trap entry: 256 stubs, one common save/restore path, one Rust handler.
#
# Intel syntax, like boot.s, because that is `global_asm!`'s default on x86.
#
# WHY 256 STUBS AND NOT ONE VECTOR TABLE. aarch64 has sixteen exception vectors, each 128 bytes,
# reached by an offset the hardware computes from the exception class; RISC-V has one, and the cause
# is in `scause`. x86 has neither: the CPU jumps to the address in IDT entry N and tells the handler
# **nothing** about which N that was. The vector number is only recoverable if each entry points at
# a different piece of code that knows its own number. So the number is pushed by the stub, and the
# stubs are generated rather than written out.
#
# THE ERROR CODE IS THE SECOND ASYMMETRY, and it is worse than it looks. Ten of the 32 architectural
# exceptions push an extra word before the return frame; the other 246 vectors do not. If the common
# path did not know which, `iretq` would return to whatever the error code happened to be. The stubs
# push a dummy zero for the vectors that have none, so exactly one frame layout reaches Rust and
# exactly one `add rsp, 16` undoes it.
#
# THE `swapgs` PAIR, AND WHY IT IS GUARDED RATHER THAN UNCONDITIONAL (milestone 161, roadmap
# item 3). A trap from ring 3 arrives with the USER's GS base, and this kernel keeps its per-CPU
# pointer in the kernel's, so the first thing that takes a lock would read whatever the user left in
# `IA32_GS_BASE`. `swapgs` exchanges `IA32_GS_BASE` with `IA32_KERNEL_GS_BASE`, which is what makes
# the kernel's pointer unforgeable: the value the kernel needs is in a register the user cannot
# write, exactly as RISC-V's `sscratch` is.
#
# It is an EXCHANGE, not a load, so it must run exactly once per privilege change in each direction.
# A trap from ring 0 that swapped would install the user's base while running kernel code; a nested
# trap that swapped again would put the kernel's back and then hand it to the user on the way out.
# So both sites test the saved CS's low two bits, which ARE the interrupted CPL, and swap only for a
# 3. Note what is deliberately not tested: `SS`, which a `syscall` return leaves unreliable, and the
# frame's RPL alone, which is the same two bits read a longer way round.
#
# `swapgs` writes an MSR pair and does NOT load a segment register, so it does not trip the hazard
# `segments.rs` documents at length (loading a segment register in long mode zeroes that segment's
# base MSR). Verified against the SDM's description of the instruction rather than assumed, because
# that hazard has already cost this port an afternoon once.
#
# THE WINDOW ON THE WAY OUT is the one place this is delicate. Between the exit `swapgs` and the
# `iretq` the CPU is in ring 0 holding the USER's GS base, so an interrupt taken there would see
# CPL 0, decline to swap, and dereference the user's value. `RFLAGS.IF` is clear at every such site
# (an interrupt gate cleared it on entry; `IA32_FMASK` clears it for `syscall`; the two entry points
# below `cli` before they touch anything), which closes it for everything except an NMI or a machine
# check. Those need a paranoid entry path that reads `IA32_GS_BASE` and decides, which this port
# does not have; it is recorded in notes/x86-port/ring-3.md rather than pretended away.

# unwind going past the trap rather than stopping at it: the x86-64 hardware frame puts RIP and RSP
# at fixed, known offsets from here (CFA+16 and CFA+40 below), and the SysV DWARF mapping already

#
# THIS IS NOT AN IDT VECTOR AND THE DIFFERENCES ALL MATTER. `syscall` is a two-cycle jump, not an
# interrupt: it does not consult the IDT, does not read `TSS.RSP0`, and therefore **does not switch
# stacks** -- `rsp` still names the user's. It also does not push anything. What it does is save
# `rip` into `rcx` and `RFLAGS` into `r11` (which is why the ABI's fourth argument rides in `r10`;
# see exceptions.rs), load `rip` from `IA32_LSTAR`, take CS/SS from `IA32_STAR[47:32]`, and clear
# every `RFLAGS` bit named by `IA32_FMASK` -- including `IF`, so this arrives with interrupts
# masked exactly as an interrupt gate would.
#
# So the first three instructions are the whole of what the hardware did not do, and their order is
# forced: nothing may touch a lock (which reads the per-CPU block through `gs`) before the `swapgs`,
# and nothing may push before `rsp` names a kernel stack.
#
# THE KERNEL STACK COMES FROM THIS CORE'S `PerCpu` BLOCK, reached through `gs` (milestone 161's SMP
# item; `gs` has just been swapped to the kernel's, so it names THIS core's own block, no other
# core's). `segments::set_kernel_stack` writes the same slot (`SYSCALL_KERNEL_RSP_OFF`) and
# `TSS.RSP0` together, so the two mechanisms cannot name different stacks.

# way isr_common's hardware-pushed words do. The CFA baseline starts AFTER the stack switch
# (`mov rsp, gs:[...]`) rather than trying to describe the two-instruction window beforehand, where
