//! **The saved register context of a thread, x86_64.** The Rust half of `context.s`, and the third
//! implementation of the seam `thread.rs` talks to: it asks for a context "for a kernel thread" or
//! "for a user thread" and never names a register, so which register carries the closure, the entry
//! or the return stays inside `arch/`.
//!
//! Where aarch64 saves `x19`..`x30` and RISC-V saves `ra` plus `s0`..`s11`, the System V AMD64 ABI's
//! callee-saved set is six registers wide: `rbx`, `rbp`, `r12`..`r15`. The return address is not a
//! register at all on x86, it is a stack slot, which is why it is the last field here rather than
//! the first as RISC-V's `ra` is.

/// The callee-saved registers, as `switch_to` pushes them.
///
/// **This layout is a contract with `context.s`.** Seven `u64` slots, 56 bytes, in exactly this
/// order; the first six are read back by the `pop` sequence and the seventh is what `ret` jumps to.
/// Reorder a field and the assembly restores the wrong register.
///
/// # The size is 56 and that is deliberate
///
/// A thread's context is placed at `stack_top - size_of::<Context>()` with a 16-byte-aligned
/// `stack_top`, so 56 puts the context at 8 mod 16 and leaves `rsp` **16-byte aligned** the instant
/// `ret` lands in a trampoline. That is what the trampolines' own `call` requires, and it is the
/// only reason the number matters. Padding this to 64 for tidiness would misalign every thread's
/// first call, which shows up much later as a fault inside code that uses SSE.
