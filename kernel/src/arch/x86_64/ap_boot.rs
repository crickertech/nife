//! **Starting a second logical CPU: INIT-SIPI-SIPI and the real-mode trampoline it needs**
//! (milestone 161's SMP item).
//!
//! aarch64 asks firmware to start a core (PSCI `CPU_ON`) and RISC-V asks SBI (`hart_start`); x86
//! has no firmware call for this at all. Starting a second CPU here means sending it two kinds of
//! inter-processor interrupt through the local APIC: an INIT (reset it into a wait-for-SIPI state)
//! and two STARTUP IPIs ("SIPI"), which name a *physical page below 1 MiB* the target begins
//! executing at, in 16-bit real mode. See `irq::send_init`/`irq::send_startup` for the messages
//! themselves and `boot.s`'s `secondary_boot` (the trampoline that page holds) for what runs there.
//!
//! **This module's whole job is the one thing INIT-SIPI-SIPI cannot do for itself**: getting the
//! trampoline's bytes onto that low page and handing it the one value that varies per core (the
//! stack top), before the messages are sent.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **Three failures were found bringing this up, and all three are now root-caused and fixed.**
//! They are kept here because this is where each was found and where a reader meets the symptom.
//! `helpers/qemu-runner-x86_64.sh` still defaults `NIFE_SMP` to 1, and the one thing now holding it
//! there is not a bring-up bug at all (see the end of #3).
//!
//! **1. A secondary was reported "did not start" when it had started. FIXED 2026-09-19 (milestone
//! 161).** The symptom as first recorded: at `-smp 3` and above, one secondary per boot typically
//! failed to come online, *which* one varied, and the online count fell one short. Two hypotheses
//! were tested and refuted (a `hlt` wait instead of a spin, in case CPU 0 starved the target's vCPU
//! thread; copying the trampoline once instead of per `STARTUP` IPI, in case of QEMU's
//! self-modifying-code detection), and both changes are kept on their own merits.
//!
//! **Neither hypothesis could have worked, because no core was failing.** Reproduced 2026-09-19 on
//! patagonia at `-smp 4`, plain boot, bounded, 40 runs: **26 of 40 had a core reported as not
//! started** (cores 1, 2 and 3 all took turns, including the *first* secondary, so "third or
//! later" was never the boundary), and the transcript of the very first failure gave it away: the
//! "failed" core printed its own `cr4.smep : set on core 2` line, which only `secondary_main` on
//! that core can print, one line *before* `smp: cpu 2 did not start`. An instrumented build then
//! printed the count at each point of `super::cpu_start`, and in all three failures of ten it read
//! the same: **online count at the INIT = n, at the wait loop = n + 1, now = n + 1.**
//!
//! `cpu_start` read the online count before the INIT and then *read it again* just before its wait
//! loop, after the `STARTUP` IPIs and their 200 us settle delays, and waited for the count to move
//! from that second value. A core fast enough to check in during those delays had already moved
//! it, so the loop waited its full ten seconds for a second increment that nobody would make,
//! returned -1, and `smp::bring_up_secondaries` counted an online, running core as absent. Under
//! TCG "fast enough" is a matter of which vCPU thread the host schedules when, which is why it was
//! intermittent and why which core it hit varied. (The earlier port-I/O checkpoint evidence, a core
//! reaching long mode and "never reaching" the checkpoint before `jmp secondary_main`, is not
//! reproduced by anything above and is best read as the instrumentation losing a race of its
//! own; it is recorded rather than explained.)
//!
//! **The fix is one line removed**: the count is read once, before the INIT, and every wait
//! compares against that. Measured after, same host, same bounded loop: **40 of 40 boots at
//! `-smp 4`, 20 of 20 at `-smp 8` (this kernel's `MAX_CPUS`) and 20 of 20 at `-smp 3` brought every
//! core online**, against 14 of 40 before. All of it is QEMU TCG; the defect is in this port's own
//! code rather than in the emulator, so there is no reason to expect silicon to differ, but xenon
//! has not been asked.
//!
//! **2. Two cores crashed under the kernel's own test suite's real scheduler workload. FIXED
//! 2026-08-25 (milestone 161's SMP-crash lane); root cause was a missing cross-core TLB
//! shootdown**, recorded here because this is where the symptom was found and where a reader
//! meets it.
//!
//! The symptom was a `script/test` run at `NIFE_SMP=2` faulting with `rip` = `stack::PAINT`
//! (`0x5afe57ac5afe57ac`), the pattern this kernel writes into a fresh kernel stack, or with
//! `rip` = 0. It reproduced on 10 of 10 runs.
//!
//! The cause was not in this file, and not in the portable scheduler either. `arch::x86_64::mmu`'s
//! `flush_tlb` was **local to the calling CPU**: `invlpg` invalidates one core's TLB and says
//! nothing about any other, and its own doc comment said so and predicted this
//! (*"a multi-CPU kernel needs a software shootdown protocol (an IPI) ... this is the line that
//! will need company"*). SMP arrived and the line never got its company. aarch64 needs none
//! (`tlbi ..., is` is broadcast by the hardware) and RISC-V already had one (an SBI RFENCE), which
//! is why the same portable `sched`/`thread` code runs clean at `-smp 4` on both.
//!
//! The failure that produced is exact rather than vague. `thread::KernelStack::drop` unmaps a dead
//! thread's stack and hands the address range back for reuse; a core that had cached a translation
//! for that range kept it, so when the range was remapped onto **different** physical frames the
//! stale core read the old frame instead. A `Context` read back that way is whatever the old frame
//! now holds, and since a freshly recycled stack page is painted, the `ret` at the end of
//! `switch_to` jumped to the paint. Confirmed by making a stale entry harmless (never reusing stack
//! address space, so no VA is ever remapped onto a new frame): the fault vanished, 8 runs of 8,
//! leaving only that test's own reuse assertion.
//!
//! The fix is `mmu::shoot_down_others`, and the one part of it worth knowing here is **why it is an
//! NMI**: `unmap_page` runs inside `KERNEL_MMU`, an `IrqSafeMutex`, so both the sender and every
//! other core running the same code have interrupts masked, and a maskable IPI would deadlock the
//! first time two cores spawned and reaped concurrently. notes/riscv-tlb-shootdown.md already
//! names that property as load-bearing for RISC-V, which gets it from M-mode; on x86 the NMI is the
//! only delivery `cli` cannot suppress. See that function's own doc comment.
//!
//! **3. A secondary is brought up and idles, but the suite cannot agree on which core booted.
//! FIXED 2026-09-17 (milestone 316)**; the diagnosis below stands and the fix is at the end of it.
//! `arch::x86_64::boot_cpu_id` read CPUID leaf 1's initial local APIC id, which is
//! *"which core am I"* and not *"which core booted"*. aarch64 answers a constant `0` and RISC-V
//! returns the hart id recorded at boot; only this port recomputes it per caller. So any test body
//! that §28's placement has migrated onto a secondary gets that secondary's id as "the boot core",
//! and `smp::tests::every_secondary_runs_scheduled_work` then waits for a `RAN_ON` mark the real
//! boot core never sets ("secondary core 0 never ran scheduled work"). `stack.rs`'s high-water
//! report skips a slot chosen the same way, so it scans a never-painted slot and reports a
//! secondary stack at 65536/65536. One cause, both symptoms, roughly half of runs at `NIFE_SMP=2`.
//! It reproduces with **no shootdown code present at all** (checked against the pre-fix tree), so
//! it predates #2's fix rather than following from it.
//!
//! **The predicted shape was right.** `boot.s`'s `_start_high` now stamps the id into
//! `arch::x86_64::BOOT_CPU_ID` after zeroing `.bss` and before calling `kernel_main`, and
//! `boot_cpu_id` reads that record; see its own doc. Code that runs exactly once, on exactly the
//! boot processor, cannot tell a later caller that the later caller is it, which is the property
//! RISC-V's `BOOT_HARTID` already had and this port was missing. Both symptoms went with it, and
//! the suite reaches `test result: ok. 245 passed` at two cores.
//!
//! **`NIFE_SMP` still defaults to 1**, and milestones 316 and 161 changed *which* open thing holds
//! it there: #1 and #3 are both closed. The two-core suite is not yet clean for a reason that is not
//! an SMP bring-up bug at all: `user::x86_port_tests::a_revoked_holder_faults_on_its_next_port_write` goes
//! red intermittently at two cores, because `sched::delete_port_range_caps_impl` resets the TSS I/O
//! bitmap on **the revoker's core only**, so a holder running on the other core keeps the ports for
//! up to one tick. That window is milestone 313's audit's, recorded and accepted at that function,
//! and milestone 315 is the lane that closes it. It is a real confinement defect the second core
//! makes visible rather than a flake, which is worth more than a green run: the suite already
//! contains the two-core observer milestone 315 was going to have to write.
//!
//! #2's fix is verified rather than gated: `user::tests::an_asid_flush_reaches_the_other_cores`,
//! the portable test milestone 58 wrote for exactly this property, **fails on this port without
//! the shootdown and passes with it**. It cannot be a CI gate until the default moves, and the
//! default cannot move until the revocation window is answered (DECISIONS §153: close milestone
//! 315, then default to 2).
//!
//! #1 was this port's own bug and not TCG's, so milestone 87's hardware is no longer needed to
//! settle it; xenon (`bench/xenon-2026-09-17/first-light-095500.log`, four processors) has still
//! never been asked to bring all four online, and the line to read there is `smp: 4 core(s)
//! online`.
