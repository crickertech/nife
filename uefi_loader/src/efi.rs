//! **The slice of UEFI this loader speaks**, hand-written rather than taken as a dependency.
//!
//! # Why there is no `uefi` crate here
//!
//! DECISIONS §46: a dependency is a decision, and the tree's shape is thin architectural
//! primitives or whole subsystems nobody would write, with nothing in between. The `uefi` crate is
//! squarely in between. What this loader needs is **seven function pointers and three GUIDs**:
//! allocate pages, get the memory map, exit boot services, print a line, locate one protocol, and
//! the two ACPI configuration-table identifiers plus the graphics one. That is the whole of it, and
//! it is written below in a few hundred lines that a reader can check against the specification
//! without leaving the repository. (Six and two until milestone 243 (a machine with no serial port
//! has no way to say anything) asked where the screen is;
//! eight and five since milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install that makes a
//! second customer possible)'s rung 2a asked the loader to read its own file, which adds
//! `HandleProtocol` and the three small protocol tables at the end of this file.)
//!
//! The cost of getting it wrong is also unusually visible: a mis-numbered field in
//! [`BootServices`] is a call to the wrong function pointer, which faults immediately and loudly at
//! the very start of boot, rather than being the sort of subtle wrongness a dependency protects
//! against.
//!
//! # The one rule to remember when editing this file
//!
//! **[`BootServices`]'s field order is the ABI.** The firmware hands over a pointer to a table it
//! filled in; every entry is found by its offset and nothing checks the name. Adding a field in the
//! middle, or getting the count of unused ones wrong, silently re-points every call after it. The
//! fields are therefore listed in specification order, in full, with the unused ones spelled
//! `usize` and *counted* in comments rather than collapsed into an array.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The struct definitions stop where this loader's needs stop.** [`SystemTable`] ends after
//!   `configuration_table`, [`BootServices`] ends after `locate_protocol`, and [`GraphicsOutput`]
//!   ends after `mode`; the real tables
//!   are longer. That is safe (the firmware's allocation is larger than ours, and we only read),
//!   but a field added below the last one listed will not be found by name and has to be counted
//!   in from the specification the same way these were.
//! - **Nothing validates the table headers' CRC.** The firmware is the trust root at this point in
//!   boot; there is nothing to check it against that is not also the firmware.
