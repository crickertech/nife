//! **The boot entry real firmware can start** (milestone 87; aarch64 and riscv64 since the stick
//! milestone, 2026-09-19).
//!
//! A UEFI application the firmware loads from the removable-media path of a FAT volume
//! (`\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI`, `BOOTAA64.EFI`, `BOOTRISCV64.EFI`), carrying the kernel and the
//! userspace archive inside itself, which asks the firmware the questions a kernel cannot ask once
//! the firmware is gone and hands over. One source, three architectures; what differs is how the
//! kernel is told about the machine, and that lives under `src/arch/`:
//!
//! | Architecture | The kernel's entry contract | Told about the machine by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `x86_64` | PVH: 32-bit protected mode, `ebx` = `hvm_start_info` | a synthesised `hvm_start_info` (`arch/x86_64`) |
//! | aarch64 | Linux arm64 `booti`: MMU off, `x0` = device tree | the firmware's device tree, with `/chosen` naming the archive (`arch/aarch64`) |
//! | riscv64 | Linux riscv `booti`: paging off, `a0` = hart, `a1` = device tree | the same, plus the boot hart from the firmware (`arch/riscv64`) |
//!
//! In every case **the kernel is not modified and cannot tell which loader started it**: the state
//! it is entered in is the state QEMU's `-kernel` or U-Boot's `booti` would have entered it in.
//!
//! **Read notes/x86-uefi-boot.md and notes/boot-stick.md before changing anything here.**
//!
//! # The order of operations is rigid, and two rules are why
//!
//! `ExitBootServices` takes a `map_key` from a `GetMemoryMap` with **no allocation in between**, so
//! every buffer is allocated before that call and filled in after it. And **after
//! `ExitBootServices` there is no console**: a failure past that point can only halt, so everything
//! checkable is checked while there is still something to report it on.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Secure Boot must be off.** This image is unsigned and nothing here signs it. On the `OptiPlex`
//!   that is a firmware setting; under QEMU it is the difference between `edk2-x86_64-code.fd` and
//!   `edk2-x86_64-secure-code.fd`. Signing is milestone 22's neighbourhood (`measured_boot`), not
//!   this one.
//! - **The kernel is embedded rather than loaded from the filesystem.** One file on the stick
//!   instead of three, and no `SimpleFileSystem` protocol to speak, at the cost of rebuilding this
//!   loader whenever the kernel changes. `cargo xtask uefi-image` and `cargo xtask stick` do both
//!   in one command, and the stick carries a `NIFE.TXT` naming its build, so a stale file is no
//!   longer silent; it is still stale.
//! - **Nothing here verifies what it hands over at boot.** The kernel and the archive are bytes this
//!   binary was compiled with, so the trust boundary is the build. `build.rs` does refuse to embed
//!   an archive the kernel does not vouch for, which is the one check that matters at build time.
//! - **AP bring-up under UEFI is proved on OVMF and nowhere else** (milestone 195); see
//!   `arch/x86_64`.
//! - **The `hvm_start_info` command line carries exactly one thing** (milestone 243): where the
//!   screen is. Nothing reads a configuration file off the stick, so anything on that line is
//!   something this binary decided.
//! - **The screen is taken as the firmware left it**, and on aarch64 and riscv64 it is not handed
//!   over at all: those kernels learn about a display from the device tree, and the firmware's GOP
//!   framebuffer is not in it.
//! - **A `PixelBitMask` or `PixelBltOnly` adapter gets no screen** on `x86_64`, and the loader says
//!   so before it hands over.
