//! **aarch64: the firmware's device tree, and the Linux arm64 boot state.**
//!
//! The kernel's entry contract here is the one U-Boot's `booti` meets (Linux's
//! Documentation/arch/arm64/booting.rst, which `kernel/src/arch/aarch64/boot.s` cites): entered at
//! the image's first byte with **the MMU off**, `x0` = the physical address of the device tree and
//! `x1`..`x3` zero, at EL2 or EL1 (the kernel drops itself from EL2). UEFI hands over the opposite
//! state: MMU on with an identity map, caches on. So the whole delta is:
//!
//! 1. copy the firmware's device tree, adding `/chosen/linux,initrd-*` for the archive
//!    (`uefi_loader::device_tree_patch`);
//! 2. exit boot services;
//! 3. clean and invalidate the data cache to the point of coherency over everything the kernel will
//!    read with its caches off, so it reads what was written rather than stale RAM;
//! 4. turn the MMU and the data cache off at whichever exception level we are running at, and
//!    branch (`leave_uefi.s`).
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **An ACPI machine is described second-hand.** A machine that offers no device tree is read out
//!   of its ACPI tables and a tree is **written** for it here
//!   ([`uefi_loader::device_tree_from_acpi`]), which is what makes an SBBR server (every aarch64
//!   cloud instance) bootable at all. The translation loses what only AML holds: no PCI bus, no
//!   virtio-mmio, no `fw_cfg`. That module's own BUGS section is the list, and the firmware's tree
//!   stays first in [`discover`]'s order precisely because it is the richer of the two.
//! - **The kernel is linked for `0x4008_0000`** (`kernel/link-aarch64.ld`), which is QEMU `virt`'s
//!   RAM. argon's RAM starts at `0x8000_0000`, so this payload cannot place its kernel there and
//!   says so with the firmware's memory map printed: the same limit milestone 127's port has to
//!   lift for `booti`, not one the stick adds.
//! - **Everything the kernel reads early must be below 2 GiB** ([`ALLOCATION_CEILING`]), because
//!   the boot map in `boot.s` is one 1 GiB block of RAM at `0x4000_0000`. A firmware that keeps its
//!   device tree higher is fine (it is copied down); one with no free RAM below 2 GiB is not.
