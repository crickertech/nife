//! **riscv64: the firmware's device tree, the boot hart, and the Linux RISC-V boot state.**
//!
//! The kernel's entry contract is the one OpenSBI's jump and U-Boot's `booti` meet
//! (`kernel/src/arch/riscv64/boot.s`): S-mode, **paging off**, `a0` = this hart's id, `a1` = the
//! physical address of the device tree. UEFI runs this loader in S-mode too, possibly with paging
//! on (an identity map), and it is the only one of the three architectures where the kernel needs
//! a number the firmware must be asked for: which hart it is running on. UEFI answers that with
//! `RISCV_EFI_BOOT_PROTOCOL` (read from EDK2's header, `efi::RiscvBootProtocol`); a firmware
//! without it is asked through the device tree's `/chosen/boot-hartid`, which U-Boot writes.
//!
//! **There is no `riscv64` UEFI target in rustc** (`rustc --print target-list`, 2026-09-19, lists
//! `aarch64-`, `i686-` and `x86_64-unknown-uefi` only). This module is therefore compiled for
//! `riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf` as a position-independent executable, and `cargo xtask` turns
//! the ELF into a PE/COFF image (`crates/portable_executable`); see notes/boot-stick.md.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The kernel is linked for `0x8020_0000`** (`kernel/link-riscv64.ld`), which is QEMU `virt`'s
//!   RAM and, by the `booti` header's deliberate `text_offset`, radon's. A board whose RAM does not
//!   contain that address cannot take this payload, and the loader says so with the memory map.
//! - **Everything the kernel reads early must be below 3 GiB** ([`ALLOCATION_CEILING`]): the boot
//!   table maps the first three gigapages and nothing above.
