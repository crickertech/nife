//! **A device tree for a machine that has none**: the ACPI tables an aarch64 server describes
//! itself with, written out as the flattened tree this kernel already reads.
//!
//! # Why this shape, and not the other one
//!
//! The `x86_64` half of this loader hands the kernel an ACPI root pointer and the kernel reads the
//! tables itself. Mirroring that here would mean a second discovery path through
//! `kernel/src/memory.rs`, `smp.rs`, `console.rs` and `arch/aarch64/`, every one of which asks the
//! device tree today, **and a change to what the loader and the kernel agree on across the
//! handoff**: `x0` is the physical address of a device tree blob (Linux's arm64 boot protocol, which
//! `boot.s` cites and U-Boot's `booti` meets). That is a wire format, and wire formats are decided
//! by the architect rather than by a lane.
//!
//! So this takes the other road, which costs one module and changes nothing anybody agreed on: the
//! loader reads the tables while the firmware is still alive and **writes the tree the kernel would
//! have been handed**. The kernel boots on an ACPI machine without knowing that ACPI exists.
//!
//! **This is a translation and it loses information**, which is the honest reason the firmware's own
//! device tree stays first in the aarch64 loader's own order when a machine offers both. See BUGS.
//!
//! # Tested by the reader, not by inspection
//!
//! Every test below decodes what this writes with `crates/device_tree_blob` and the
//! `machine_discovery` decoders the **kernel** uses (`gic::discover`, `cpu_list::CpuList`,
//! `aarch64::Psci`, `interrupt_id::of_node`, `DeviceTreeBlob::memory_regions`), so the writer and
//! the readers cannot drift apart without a host test failing in milliseconds. That is the rule
//! `handoff.rs` and `device_tree_patch.rs` already follow.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **No PCI.** An ECAM window is in the MCFG, but a PCI node also needs `ranges` (the 32-bit and
//!   64-bit BAR windows) and an `interrupt-map`, and on an ACPI machine both of those live in the
//!   DSDT's `_CRS` and `_PRT`, which are AML. So no `pci-host-ecam-generic` node is written at all,
//!   `memory::pci_regions()` answers `None`, and the boot takes the same path it takes on the
//!   JH7110, which has no such node either. A bus that is there is invisible.
//! - **No virtio-mmio, no `fw_cfg`, no ITS.** Same reason for the first two (QEMU describes them in
//!   AML); the third is a node `machine_discovery::gic` does not read yet (milestone 317 (the
//!   interrupt-remapping flags, and where MSI confinement actually lives)).
//! - **The memory map is the UEFI one, merged.** Runtime-services and ACPI regions are excluded, so
//!   the kernel will not hand out the tables it was described by, and conventional plus
//!   boot-services plus loader memory is offered as RAM. That is the same set the firmware's own
//!   device tree offers, which is why it is not narrower.
//! - **Register block sizes are architectural, not stated.** The MADT gives a GIC distributor's
//!   address and never its length, because the GIC architecture fixes the frame at 64 KiB. The same
//!   goes for the GICv2 CPU interface and the PL011's page. A machine whose frames are elsewhere
//!   would need this told rather than assumed, and nothing here would notice.
//! - **One `/memory` node per merged run, capped at [`MAX_RAM`].** A machine with more runs than
//!   that is described short, and nothing says so.
//!
//! Names in this module are **provisional** (2026-09-23): the module, [`Machine`], [`Cpu`],
//! [`Uart`], [`build`] and the root node's `compatible` string all name things a reader meets, and
//! naming is an architect's call.
