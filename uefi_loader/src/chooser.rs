//! **The chooser**: the half of this loader that decides *which* image boots, so that a bad
//! upgrade cannot brick the machine (rung 2b of milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install that makes a second customer possible); calef ruled it on 2026-09-21).
//!
//! An installed nife machine keeps two copies of its boot image in two partitions of its own type
//! (`crates/boot_slot`). The file the firmware starts, at `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI`, is a third copy,
//! and its extra job is this module: read the slot state out of the GPT, pick a slot, **spend one
//! of that slot's tries and write it to the disk**, and chain-load the image in it. If an upgrade
//! never comes up, its tries run out and the machine returns to the previous image on its own, with
//! nobody at the console.
//!
//! # Why the chooser is here and not in the firmware
//!
//! Because it cannot be anywhere else. UEFI 2.11 section 5.3.3 reserves GPT attribute bits 48 to 63 for
//! the owner of the partition's type GUID and tells everyone else to leave them alone, so OVMF and
//! ordinary firmware do not read them and were never going to. ChromeOS, which is where this design
//! comes from, gets firmware-level selection because depthcharge is a coreboot payload that
//! *replaces* UEFI. We have UEFI, so **the first code of ours that runs is the selector**, and the
//! first code of ours that runs is this file.
//!
//! `crates/boot_slot` carries the policy, the bit layout and the refusal of the `Boot####` variable
//! design; what is here is the firmware work.
//!
//! # The shape, and the one thing that keeps it from recursing
//!
//! The chooser and the image it starts are **the same binary**. That is the elegant half: there is
//! no second program to build, keep in step, or seal against the kernel, and a machine whose slots
//! are all unbootable still has a complete, known-good nife image to fall back to, namely the one
//! doing the choosing.
//!
//! What stops it chain-loading itself forever is [`STARTED_BY_CHOOSER`]: the chooser writes that
//! marker and a slot number into the child's `LoadOptions`, and an image that finds it there knows
//! it is the one being tried and goes straight on to boot its own kernel.
//!
//! # What it does, in order
//!
//! 1. Find the one whole disk on this machine whose GPT carries boot slots. **One**: two candidate
//!    disks is a refusal rather than a guess, see `BUGS`.
//! 2. Pick the bootable slot of highest priority ([`boot_slot::select_excluding`]).
//! 3. **Spend a try and write the table back, flushed, before anything else.** This is the crux of
//!    the design rather than an ordering detail; the next section is about it.
//! 4. Read the slot header and the image, and check the image against the header's checksum.
//! 5. `LoadImage` from that buffer, `StartImage`, and never come back.
//!
//! A slot the chooser cannot read at all is given up on immediately
//! ([`boot_slot::State::unreadable`]) and the next slot is tried **in the same boot**, because
//! making somebody reboot to recover from a failure the chooser watched happen would be a worse
//! machine for no gain.
//!
//! # Which failures this catches, and which it does not
//!
//! The honest table, because a rollback mechanism that is vague about this is worse than none:
//!
//! | failure | caught | by what |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | the slot was never written, or its header is corrupt | yes, in the same boot | the header's own CRC |
//! | the copy into the slot died partway | yes, in the same boot | the image CRC in the header |
//! | the image is not a PE the firmware will start | yes, in the same boot | `LoadImage` refuses, the next slot is tried |
//! | the image starts and returns an error | yes, in the same boot | `StartImage` returns, the next slot is tried |
//! | **the image starts and hangs**, before or after `ExitBootServices` | yes, on the **next** boot | the try spent at step 3, which is already on the disk |
//! | the image comes up but is subtly wrong | **no** | nothing here can tell, and nothing will |
//! | the machine loses power during step 3 | **no** | see `BUGS` |
//! | every slot is bad | the machine still boots | the image in this file is started instead |
//!
//! The row in bold is the reason step 3 is where it is. A chooser that only read the state, leaving
//! the booted system to mark itself good, would handle every row above it and none of that one: a
//! machine that wedges before userspace would retry the same bad image forever and show nothing to
//! the console nobody is standing at. ChromeOS's firmware decrements before the launch for exactly
//! this reason.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! An ordinary boot of an installed machine, where slot 0 was confirmed at install time and
//! therefore spends nothing:
//!
//! ```text
//! nife uefi_loader: milestone 87 (the x86_64 bare-metal machine)
//! uefi_loader: boot slots on one disk, 2 of them
//! uefi_loader: starting boot slot 0
//! nife uefi_loader: milestone 87 (the x86_64 bare-metal machine)
//! uefi_loader: started from boot slot 0
//! ```
//!
//! The boot after an upgrade that hung, where nobody did anything:
//!
//! ```text
//! uefi_loader: boot slots on one disk, 2 of them
//! uefi_loader: boot slot 1 has no tries left
//! uefi_loader: starting boot slot 0
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Two disks carrying boot slots is a refusal, not a choice.** The chooser enumerates whole
//!   disks and gives up if more than one has slots, falling back to the image in its own file. The
//!   correct answer is to boot the slots on *this* disk, which means reading this image's own
//!   `LoadedImage::file_path` device path, walking it to the `HARDDRIVE` node and matching that
//!   node's partition GUID against each disk's table. That is a device-path parser this loader does
//!   not have, and the same parser `place_boot_file`'s `BUGS` already wants for a different reason.
//! - **The logical block size is assumed to be 512.** A disk reporting anything else is skipped
//!   rather than misread, which is the honest half; the GPT crate reads other sizes and nothing
//!   here passes the size through. `installer` has the same assumption and the same note.
//! - **A power cut during the write at step 3 is not survivable by this design.** The table is
//!   rewritten in four block ranges and there is no journal; a machine interrupted between them can
//!   come up with a primary and backup table that disagree, which this loader's own `parse` will
//!   then refuse, and the machine falls back to the image in the chooser's file. That is a safe
//!   outcome rather than a good one, and it is untested: nothing in this tree cuts power to a QEMU
//!   between two block writes.
//! - **A slot is never marked successful by anything on a running machine**, so an upgrade that
//!   came up perfectly still rolls back once its tries are spent. `crates/boot_slot`'s `BUGS` has
//!   the whole of it.
//! - **An image started from a slot has no boot file**, because `LoadImage` from a buffer leaves
//!   the child's `DeviceHandle` null and there is no volume to read a file back from. So an
//!   installed machine cannot install itself onto a second disk; only a machine booted from the
//!   stick or from the chooser's own file can. That is a narrowing rather than a loss, and the
//!   fix is the same device path the first `BUGS` entry wants.
//! - **x86_64 only**, the same scope as the rest of rung 2a and 2b (DECISIONS §19 (architectural parity is a tenet; the targets are aarch64, riscv64 and x86_64)): the
//!   device-tree architectures have no second module slot for a boot file, which
//!   `design/roadmap/proposals/the-boot-file-has-nowhere-to-go-on-a-device-tree-machine.md` prices.
//!   Nothing about the slot format is x86-specific; the chooser is what has not been built there.
