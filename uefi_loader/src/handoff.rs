//! **Building the handoff the kernel already knows how to read.**
//!
//! This is the half of milestone 87 that decided the shape of the rest of it. The kernel's `x86_64`
//! boot handoff is PVH's `hvm_start_info`: one physical pointer to a structure carrying the memory
//! map, the ACPI root pointer, and any loaded modules. `machine_discovery::x86_64` decodes it and
//! `arch::x86_64::machine` consumes it, both host-tested, both already working.
//!
//! So this loader does not invent a UEFI handoff. **It synthesises an `hvm_start_info`**, and the
//! kernel cannot tell which loader started it. That is not a shortcut, it is the answer to the
//! hazard milestone 87 was briefed on: two boot paths that produce two different internal states
//! diverge, and the divergence shows up on hardware nobody can attach a debugger to. There is one
//! structure, one decoder, and one set of tests.
//!
//! # This module is the *writer* for `machine_discovery::x86_64`'s *reader*
//!
//! And the tests below say so literally: every encoder here is checked by decoding its output with
//! that crate. Neither side carries its own copy of the layout, which is the same rule
//! `byte_sink_protocol`, `grant_plan` and `clock_protocol` are held to.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **`EfiLoaderData` is reported as reserved and stays that way**, which is the half of this that
//!   milestone 195 did not reclaim. It holds five things the kernel needs after the frame allocator
//!   is up: the `hvm_start_info`, the memory map it points at, the module list, the userspace
//!   archive, and the kernel image itself. Reclaiming the type would let the allocator hand out the
//!   map it is reading, so what is lost is the padding: each of those is rounded up to a page and
//!   the whole class is reported at page granularity. Measured rather than guessed, at two memory
//!   sizes: see notes/x86-uefi-boot.md.
//! - **The map is passed through in firmware order and is neither sorted nor coalesced.** UEFI
//!   promises neither, and `machine_discovery::x86_64`'s own `BUGS` already records that its
//!   consumer is where such a check belongs.

/// - `boot_slot::cmdline::KEY` and a digit, when a chooser started this image. It is how the
///   running system learns which slot to confirm, and it is written **only** when there is one:
///   a stick, a `-kernel` boot, and a fallback to the image in this file all leave it off, and a
