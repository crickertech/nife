//! **The last word anything says before the kernel exists**, the early-boot half of
//! milestone 243 (a machine with no serial port).
//!
//! From `ExitBootServices` to the kernel's own `console::attach_screen` there is no console on a
//! machine with no serial port. The firmware's is gone by specification, the kernel's is not up, and
//! everything in between (this loader's mode-switch trampoline, `boot.s`'s 32-bit half, the page
//! tables, the long-mode jump) runs 32-bit with no IDT, so a fault there is a triple fault and a
//! silent reset. **That window cannot be narrated**, because no code inside it knows where the
//! screen is.
//!
//! It can be **bounded**, and this is the bounding: the screen is cleared and given one sentence, so
//! a person at a monitor can tell "the kernel never reached its first statement" from "the kernel
//! armed its console and died after", which before this were the same black rectangle.
//!
//! # Why it lives here rather than in `main.rs`
//!
//! Because it can be proved on the host. The painting is `screen_console`'s, the same crate and the
//! same font the kernel uses, so the loader's last word and the kernel's first are literally the
//! same letters; what this module adds is the text and the one call, and the test below reads it
//! back out of a RAM framebuffer rather than trusting that it was written.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```
//! use machine_discovery::framebuffer::{Framebuffer, PixelOrder};
//!
//! // A screen wide enough for the banner's longest line and two cells tall.
//! let screen = Framebuffer { base: 0, width: 560, height: 16, stride: 2240, order: PixelOrder::Bgrx };
//! let mut pixels = vec![0u8; 2240 * 16];
//! assert!(uefi_loader::screen::paint_handoff(screen, &mut pixels));
//!
//! // There is ink on it now, which a black screen at the same moment would not have.
//! assert!(pixels.chunks(4).any(|p| u32::from_le_bytes(p.try_into().unwrap())
//!     == screen_console::ScreenConsole::FOREGROUND));
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **It is unobservable in a healthy boot.** The kernel clears the screen within milliseconds of
//!   this being painted, so no gate can assert it on a working machine. What proves it is the
//!   halted-loader experiment in `notes/serial-less-output.md`.
//! - **Only ASCII**, like everything else `screen_console` draws.
