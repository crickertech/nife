//! **The FS-server core: RedoxFS behind a capability-shaped file service** (milestone 32 phase 2).
//!
//! This is the sans-IO heart of the FS server, in the `line_editor` spirit: the filesystem logic
//! with no IPC and no device in it, so it is host-tested in milliseconds against a real RedoxFS
//! image and only the wiring needs QEMU. The EL0 binary (this crate's `el0` build) wraps a
//! [`Server`] in the block-IPC [`redoxfs::Disk`] and the file-service serve loop; everything the
//! filesystem actually *does* lives here.
//!
//! # The contract, capability-shaped from birth
//!
//! A [`Server`] is opened **bound to one directory** ([`Server::open`] binds the RedoxFS root).
//! Every name a client presents is resolved *under a directory handle*: there is no absolute path,
//! no `..` escape, no global namespace. In the running system the client reaches this server only by
//! holding an endpoint the server reads on, and that endpoint IS the directory capability; a client
//! without it can open nothing. A successful open returns a **handle**, a small integer this server
//! minted and will validate against its own table, which is itself a capability: forging one is
//! meaningless because the server honors only the handles it issued. See notes/fs-server.md.
//!
//! # The directory capability (milestone 47)
//!
//! The bound directory is [`filesystem_proto::fs::ROOT`], handle 0, an ordinary entry in the same table, so
//! every name-taking verb names a directory rather than resolving against a hidden field. A
//! directory handle carries a [`filesystem_proto::dir::Rights`] set, [`Server::open_dir`] hands back a
//! handle to a child, and a child's rights are the parent's intersected with what was asked for.
//! **That intersection is the only constructor for a non-root rights set**, so no descendant can
//! carry a right its ancestor lacked, at any depth, without a check anyone could forget. A file
//! handle inherits its directory's read and write bits, so what may be done to a file was decided
//! when the directory was granted. See notes/dir-capability.md.
//!
//! **What this table is not.** It is per *server*, not per client, so two clients sharing one
//! endpoint share these handles and a rights-carrying handle attenuates only its holder. The handle
//! is the authority; the **endpoint** is the boundary. Confining a program to a subtree is
//! therefore still a caretaker process holding the wider endpoint
//! (`user/src/fs_subtree_caretaker.rs`), for exactly the reason `fs_file_caretaker` is one.
//!
//! # The error boundary
//!
//! Every method here returns `syscall::error::Result`, RedoxFS's own error type, unmapped. The
//! translation to the wire (a negated errno, `filesystem_proto::reply_err`) happens once, in the serve loop
//! at the process boundary, and nowhere else. Keeping the core in RedoxFS's error vocabulary is what
//! makes that rule enforceable: there is no ABI type in here to leak.
