//! An EL0 component gets the userspace linker script, and it must NOT be the kernel's.
//!
//! `cargo:rustc-link-arg` is per-package, which is the whole reason the EL0 programs are their own
//! packages rather than more binaries in `kernel/`.
//!
//! **The linker script lives in `crates/user_rt`, not here, and that is deliberate.** Both
//! `components` and `fixtures` link against the identical EL0 layout, so a copy in each would be
//! two places to be wrong about `0x40_0000` with nothing comparing them; milestone 73 refused to
//! rename `user/link.ld` on exactly that ground ("it is genuinely shared"), and milestone 175 split
//! the package that held it. `user_rt` is the runtime that supplies `_start`'s ABI and the panic
//! handler to every program in both packages, so a program image's layout is its business.
//! `scripts/build-ripgrep.sh` derives its high-load variant from the same file by substitution.
