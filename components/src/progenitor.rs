//! **The progenitor: the first process, on all three architectures.**
//!
//! The kernel loads this as the boot process, maps the initrd into it, and grants it the
//! capabilities `GRANTS` names below. From those, and nothing else, it builds the whole interactive
//! system out of its own budget: the console server, the input driver, the line discipline, the
//! shell, the terminal's sink adapter and the job undertaker, wired together with endpoints and
//! shared pages it creates. Then it stays alive as the spawn service. Every other process on the
//! machine descends from this one, which is what the name says.
//!
//! **All of that is `crates/system_initializer`** (milestone 96), and so is the reasoning: what the
//! progenitor gives away once the system is up, why the job pool is bounded, and the honest limits
//! (LIFO recovery, the retained scratch mappings, the sixteen-slot capability table). This file is
//! the boot entry and nothing else.
//!
//! **One program, three architectures** (milestone 266). Until then aarch64's first process was a
//! *role* of the `hello` demo catalogue (`init_boot`, role 27) while riscv64 and `x86_64` got this
//! purpose-built one, and the archive entry `init` meant a different binary depending on the board.
//! That is [DECISIONS §19](../../design/decisions/19-architectural-parity.md)'s own failure mode,
//! and the bill was paid once already: a fix that landed in one copy and not the other presented as
//! a boot that reached userspace and printed nothing at all, with no fault and no message.
//! `script/swish-check` runs both legs, which is what makes it the gate for this file.
//!
//! **One `GRANTS` table, all three architectures** (milestone 166 unified the kernel's boot
//! loaders into `kernel::user::boot_progenitor`). Until then aarch64 numbered these capabilities
//! differently and carried two at slots 1 and 3 the interactive system never used, because its
//! loader was shared with milestone 19d's test roles; riscv64 and `x86_64` used a third order. The
//! slot layout is now identical everywhere, so there is no `cfg` here at all. The one genuine
//! per-architecture difference is the *shape* of slot 1's console authority, a device page on
//! aarch64 and riscv64 and an `x86_64` `PortRange` (milestone 299, DECISIONS §121), and that is the
//! kernel's and `system_initializer`'s to know rather than a slot number this table records.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-08 (calef, milestone 266). `progenitor` replaces `init` as the archive
//! entry and `system_initializer` as this program's name. `init` is a truncated verb where the rule
//! asks for a noun, and the thing is the first process rather than an action. Refused `prime` (reads
//! as *chief* in English and as number theory in a systems tree), `origin` (not an agent noun) and
//! `first` (generic enough to name anything). The crate this program is a boot entry for keeps the
//! name `system_initializer`, ratified 2026-08-01; see this milestone's `## Follow-on`.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
