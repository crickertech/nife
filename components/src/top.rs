//! **`top`: the domain `ps` lists, ordered by what it is costing** (milestone 282 (a thread's CPU time, and the `top` it makes possible),
//! DECISIONS §150 (how does a thread's CPU time reach userspace?), notes/process-view.md).
//!
//! The whole program is: walk one supervision domain twice, once for each thread's run state and
//! once for its CPU time, rank the rows by the second, and say what it found on one stream and what
//! went wrong on the other. The table and the walk are `crates/ps`; the summary line is
//! `crates/top`; what lives here is the syscalls and the two sinks.
//!
//! # It is `ps`'s authority, asking a different question
//!
//! Three capabilities, and they are `ps`'s three, from the same named constants. Nothing here can
//! name a process the prompt did not already put in its reach, and the CPU figures come from a
//! second walk of the **same** endpoint under the **same** right, so a column that on Unix comes
//! from reading an ambient `/proc` comes here from a capability somebody handed this program.
//!
//! What differs from `ps` is the question, not the endowment. `ps` answers *what exists*, in the
//! kernel's own slot order. This answers *what is consuming*, most first, with a summary line
//! saying how large the thing being ranked is. Milestone 281 (`watch` holds exactly what `ps` holds) deleted `watch` for holding `ps`'s
//! authority while being `ps`'s own loop, and whether this program clears that bar or belongs in
//! `ps` as a flag is calef's; `crates/top`'s module docs carry the argument both ways.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//!
//! | slot | what | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | the output sink, `WRITE` | where the summary and the table go |
//! | 7 | the process domain, `ENUMERATE` | the supervision endpoint whose members it may **name** |
//! | 8 | the diagnostics sink, `WRITE` | where a refusal goes, so `>` cannot swallow it |
//! | 11 | the machine statistics page, `READ`, mapped read-only | the machine line under the summary, which is what became of `tload` (milestone 126, DECISIONS §225) |
//!
//! No clock, and that is worth stating because a `top` looks like it needs one: the uptime in the
//! summary is `user_mode_runtime::monotonic_nanos`, the ambient counter every process holds
//! unconditionally, which is the same finding `uptime` reported when it turned out to need no new
//! capability at all.
//!
//! # What a reader learns, and it is more than `ps` gave them
//!
//! A run state is one of five words about an instant. CPU time is **continuous and monotonic**: two
//! runs of this program measure how much work another thread did in between, and a holder of
//! `ENUMERATE` over a domain can watch the shape of a workload it cannot otherwise name. DECISIONS
//! §150 (how does a thread's CPU time reach userspace?) weighed that and accepted it, because `ENUMERATE` is already the right to learn what
//! exists rather than to act on it, and because the leak is bounded by the domain: this program
//! cannot see outside the subtree it was endowed, and there is nothing it can hold that would widen
//! that. It is written here as well as in the decision because this is where a reader meets the
//! method.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//! $ top
//! up 00:01:12, 3 threads: 1 running, 0 ready, 1 blocked, 1 dead
//!          TID  STATE     TIME(ms)
//!            9  running        310
//! 4294967302  dead             150
//!            5  blocked         20
//!
//! $ top > busiest.txt     the summary and the table land in the file
//! $ top | wc              and no /proc was read to make either
//! ```
//!
//! And the case with no Unix equivalent, because on Unix there is no domain to be outside of:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ top        top: this process holds no process-domain capability
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **It does not refresh**, which is the first thing a reader will look for. This kernel has no
//!   timed wait, so an interval would be a yield-spin, and a spin here is not merely wasteful the
//!   way it was in the deleted `watch`: it would be charged to this program's own thread by the
//!   counter the table ranks on, and `top` would truthfully report itself as the busiest thing on
//!   the machine. See `crates/top`'s `BUGS` for the rest, including why there is no `%CPU` column
//!   and no way to ask for the top *N*.
//! - **`top` lists itself**, as `running`, because it is a member of the domain it was spawned
//!   into, and unlike the rows below it, it is *accumulating* while it prints. Unix's `top` has the
//!   same property and the same excuse. Its own figure is small (a few ticks at most) and is
//!   truthful.
//! - **Everything `ps` records applies here**, since the walk is `ps`'s: no `CMD` column because a
//!   process has no name, a generational tid that is a large ugly number after slot reuse, and a
//!   table that is a sequence of snapshots rather than one.
//!
//! Name: provisional. `top` is the standard term for a view ranked by resource consumption, which
//! the naming tenet calls the best name available, and both DECISIONS §150 (how does a thread's CPU time reach userspace?) and milestone 281 (`watch` holds exactly what `ps` holds)
//! named this program in advance. Provisional because calef has not ruled, and because the prior
//! question is whether this is a program at all or a flag on `ps`.
