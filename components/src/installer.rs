//! **`installer`**: the program a booted stick runs to put this system on the machine's own disk
//! (milestone 198 (a package manager, and the trivial install that makes a second customer
//! possible), rung 2a).
//!
//! The proposal this follows is
//! [milestone 515 (a stick that puts itself on the machine's disk)](../../design/roadmap/515-the-installer-a-stick-runs-to-put-itself-on-the-disk.md),
//! under DECISIONS §157 (a trivial install is a web page, a USB drive, and packages).
//!
//! Name: provisional, minted 2026-09-21 by the rung 2a lane. `crates/stick_maker`'s own header
//! set the word aside for exactly this program when it refused it for itself: *"DECISIONS §157's
//! rung 2 installs nife onto a PC's own disk, and that is a different program."* calef names
//! programs; expect this to change.
//!
//! # This is the most destructive program in this tree, and its shape is the answer to that
//!
//! It replaces a disk's partition table and everything the table described. What stands between a
//! stranger and a wiped disk is **not** this program's judgement, and that is the point:
//!
//! - It holds **one disk**, as a `filesystem_protocol::blk` endpoint, and there is no path to type.
//!   `parted /dev/sda` as root reaches every disk in the machine; this reaches the one it was
//!   handed. That is `disk_partitioner`'s claim, from milestone 57 (partitioning and formatting a
//!   real drive), and this program inherits it whole.
//! - It holds an **entropy endpoint** and nothing else besides, so a GPT's unique ids are drawn
//!   rather than invented, and a run with no entropy writes nothing at all.
//! - **It is not spawned until a person has answered a question naming the disk.** The asking is
//!   `kernel/src/user/install_service.rs`'s, deliberately: a confirmation this program printed to
//!   itself would be a confirmation it could also decide to skip, and the authority to wipe the
//!   disk arrives here only after the answer.
//!
//! # Two roles, and the second is what keeps the first honest
//!
//! | `a0` | |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`ROLE_SURVEY`] | read the table back and say whether this disk already carries nife |
//! | [`ROLE_INSTALL`] | draw the ids, write the table, lay out the EFI system partition, copy the boot file |
//! | [`ROLE_CONFIRM`] | mark the boot slot this machine started from successful, so a good upgrade sticks |
//!
//! [`ROLE_CONFIRM`] is the trial boot's other half, and it is here rather than in a program of its
//! own for one reason: it is `ROLE_SURVEY` with a write. It reads the same 34 blocks with the same
//! parser, finds the slot the kernel told it about, and puts back one attribute word. A second
//! program would be a second copy of the table read, the block-page mapping, the `blk` client and
//! the verdict convention, to change nine bits.
//!
//! **It holds no entropy endpoint either**, which is the sentence that makes the write narrow
//! rather than merely small. A partition table carries unique ids, so a process with no source of
//! randomness cannot mint one; the only table it can write is a table it read, with the bits
//! `boot_slot` owns changed. What it *can* still do is the honest caveat, and it is in `BUGS`.
//!
//! `ROLE_SURVEY` is **a separate process with no entropy endpoint**, exactly as
//! `disk_partitioner`'s verify role is, and for the same reason: a program that cannot draw a
//! unique id cannot write a partition table anything would read back. It is what lets the boot ask
//! "is nife already on this disk" without the kernel parsing a partition table and without granting
//! the authority to write one.
//!
//! # What it writes, in order
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | 1 | A GPT: a **nife data partition first**, then two boot slots, then an EFI system partition at the end of the disk |
//! | 2 | A FAT32 volume in the EFI system partition (`crates/file_allocation_table`) |
//! | 3 | The boot file, into that volume, at `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI`, where it is the **chooser** |
//! | 4 | The same boot file again, raw, into boot slot 0, with the slot marked good |
//!
//! ## The two boot slots, which are rung 2b and calef's ruling of 2026-09-21
//!
//! *"Yes, write the tries and priority attributes in 2b."* **An installed machine must not be
//! brickable by a bad upgrade**: if a newly written boot image fails to come up, the machine has to
//! go back to the previous one by itself, with nobody at the console.
//!
//! So an install lays out **two** boot slots and fills one. The image in the EFI system partition
//! is a third copy and it has a different job: the firmware starts it, and it chooses between the
//! slots (`uefi_loader`'s chooser). Upgrades replace a slot; the chooser stays where it is.
//!
//! The state that decides which slot boots is three fields in each slot partition's **GPT
//! attribute bits**, which is `crates/boot_slot` and where the whole argument is. What belongs
//! here is only why the slots are partitions and not files: UEFI 2.11 5.3.3 gives bits 48 to 63 to
//! the owner of the partition's type GUID, and
//! [`types::NIFE_BOOT`](globally_unique_identifier_partition_table::guid::types::NIFE_BOOT) is
//! ours. On a file, or on somebody else's partition type, they would not be.
//!
//! This install writes **slot 0 confirmed** ([`boot_slot::State::installed`]) and leaves slot 1
//! laid out and empty, so that an upgrade has somewhere to write without repartitioning a running
//! machine.
//!
//! It does **not** create the filesystem in the data partition. `redoxfs_server`'s `mkfs` already
//! does exactly that, finding the partition by its type GUID, and it is run next by the same
//! service. Two programs with one capability each beats one program with two.
//!
//! ## Why the data partition comes first, which is the unusual half
//!
//! A GPT does not care about order, and every installer a reader has met puts the EFI system
//! partition first. This one does not, and the reason is a property of the filesystem engine rather
//! than a preference. `redoxfs`'s `FileSystem::open` scans blocks `0..65536` of whatever disk it is
//! handed for its header, and adopts the block it finds it at as the filesystem's origin. So a
//! RedoxFS that begins inside the first 256 MiB of a disk is mounted correctly **by a server that
//! was given the whole disk**, and the installed system's boot needs no partition-aware mount, no
//! base-block field on the `blk` wire, and no program in the middle.
//!
//! That is a real simplification and it is also a real authority loss, recorded in `BUGS` below:
//! the filesystem server on an installed machine can address the EFI system partition and the
//! partition table, which a partition-bounded mount would make impossible. `mkfs` shows what the
//! bounded version looks like (its `PartitionDisk`), and closing the gap is a lane of its own.
//!
//! # The boot file, and why it is not in the archive
//!
//! The bytes written at step 3 are a copy of the file this machine was booted from, mapped
//! read-only into this program by the kernel. It cannot come from the archive, because the file
//! *contains* the archive; `uefi_loader`'s `place_boot_file` reads it back off the boot volume
//! while the firmware is still up, and the whole argument is there.
//!
//! **The kernel and the archive therefore move as a set**, which is the failure this design had to
//! make unexpressible: a disk carrying a new kernel beside an archive it does not vouch for halts
//! at `MEASURED BOOT REFUSED`. They are sealed together inside the one file at build time, and this
//! program copies the file.
//!
//! # EXAMPLES
//!
//! ```text
//!   install: disk 1073741824 bytes, 2097152 blocks of 512
//!   install: nife data at 2048..1046527, EFI system at 1046528..2095103
//!   install: EFI system partition laid out, 2099 metadata sectors
//!   install: boot file 10392064 bytes written
//!   report: R_INSTALLED, data at 2048
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **Whole disk only.** The table is replaced wholesale. Installing beside another operating
//!   system means resizing a filesystem nife cannot read, which is milestone 140 (mount a drive
//!   this system did not create)'s territory and a different order of risk to somebody's data.
//! - **The installed filesystem is not bounded by its partition**, for the reason the section above
//!   gives. **The filesystem server on an installed machine holds the whole disk**, bounded only by
//!   the extent `mkfs` recorded in the filesystem's own header, so its allocator never learns about
//!   the blocks past the end and never reaches the EFI system partition or the table. That is a
//!   property of the filesystem rather than a capability, which is the wrong rung of AGENTS.md's
//!   ladder, and it is recorded here rather than papered over. Closing it means bounding the
//!   *server*: either a base-block field on the `blk` wire, which is a value two programs agree on
//!   and therefore calef's, or a caretaker between the disk and the FS server, which costs one IPC
//!   hop per filesystem block. `mkfs`'s own `PartitionDisk` is what the bounded version looks like.
//! - **The logical block size is assumed to be 512**, the same assumption and the same reason as
//!   `disk_surveyor` and `disk_partitioner`: nothing in `filesystem_protocol::blk` carries the
//!   device's. An NVMe namespace formatted with 4096-byte logical blocks would get a table no other
//!   operating system can read. The fix is a field on the wire.
//! - **The boot slots cost 128 MiB and one of them is always empty after an install.** Two 64 MiB
//!   partitions is the price of never being one bad upgrade away from a dead machine, and it is
//!   paid on every installed machine whether or not it is ever upgraded. 64 MiB is
//!   `uefi_loader`'s own `BOOT_FILE_MAX` rather than a measurement of the image.
//! - **Nothing writes slot 1**, because nothing in this tree upgrades a running machine yet. The
//!   slot is laid out and marked never-boot so that whatever does it later does not have to
//!   repartition a disk somebody's data is on. Until then the rollback mechanism is exercised by
//!   `cargo xtask rollback-boot` and by nothing a person does.
//! - **Nothing marks a trial boot successful**, so an upgrade that came up perfectly still rolls
//!   back once its tries are spent. That fails safe and it means upgrades do not stick;
//!   `crates/boot_slot`'s `BUGS` has the whole of it and names the proposal.
//! - **A disk under about 700 MiB is refused**, up from about 600 before the slots. The floor is
//!   the 512 MiB EFI system partition, two 64 MiB slots and the 64 MiB minimum for data, and
//!   nothing tests the refusal.
//! - **Nothing here is crash-atomic.** A power cut partway through leaves a disk that boots nothing.
//!   Real installers share the property; nobody has measured this one.
//! - **There is no progress report during the copy.** Ten megabytes at one 4096-byte request per
//!   round trip is a few thousand calls, and a person watching a serial console sees nothing until
//!   it is done.
//! - **It writes no firmware boot entry.** The file goes at the removable-media fallback path
//!   `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` on the new disk, which OVMF starts and which most firmware starts.
//!   Milestone 515 records this as B1 and calls it unmeasured on anything but OVMF; a firmware that
//!   refuses it needs `SetVariable`, which is a runtime service this kernel does not map.
