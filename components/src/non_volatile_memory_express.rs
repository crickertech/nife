//! **The NVMe block server, at EL0** (milestone 261;
//! [DECISIONS §86](../../design/decisions/86-el0-nvme-driver.md), DECIDED 2026-09-03 as option 2a;
//! notes/non-volatile-memory-express.md).
//!
//! An unprivileged process that drives a real, non-virtio DMA device: it builds 64-byte commands,
//! rings a hardware doorbell, and watches a completion ring's phase tag, while holding no
//! authority to reset the controller, to move a queue, or to reach a byte of memory outside the
//! region an IOMMU has already confined the controller to. That combination is the microkernel
//! thesis for storage, and until this program existed the NVMe driver was kernel code.
//!
//! ```text
//!   NVMe controller ──doorbell page (1 page of BAR0)──► this program ──blk IPC──► clients
//!    (a PCIe function)                                     │
//!    confined by the IOMMU to ──────────────────────────── its data plane: two I/O rings
//!    the kernel's DMA region                                and a transfer buffer
//! ```
//!
//! # What it holds, and what it is denied
//!
//! **Held**, and this is the complete list, because a capability system has no ambient
//! environment:
//!
//! - slot 0, the **request** endpoint (RECV): clients `CALL` here, `filesystem_protocol::blk`'s
//!   wire format, the same contract the virtio block server speaks;
//! - slot 1, a **readiness** endpoint (WRITE): one message, once the first command has
//!   round-tripped;
//! - mapped at [`DATA_PLANE_VA`]: the **data plane's** pages of the DMA region, read/write: the
//!   I/O submission ring, the I/O completion ring, and [`TRANSFER_BLOCKS`] pages of buffer;
//! - mapped at [`DOORBELL_VA`]: **one page of BAR0**, device-typed, at `bar0 + 0x1000`.
//!
//! **Denied**, and every line of it is a decision rather than an omission:
//!
//! - **BAR0's controller register page.** `CC`, `CSTS`, `AQA`, `ASQ` and `ACQ` live at offsets
//!   0x000..0x1000 and this process is not mapped them. It cannot reset the controller, cannot
//!   disable it, and cannot repoint the admin rings. NVMe 1.4 §3.1 put a page boundary exactly
//!   where the authority boundary belongs, which is why this split costs no new syscall.
//! - **The admin plane's pages of the DMA region.** The two admin rings and the IDENTIFY buffer
//!   are in the same confined region and are not in this address space.
//! - **Any admin command at all.** Creating a queue is what names the physical address a ring
//!   lives at; this process never issues one, so where its rings live is the kernel's statement
//!   and not its own.
//! - **An `Irq` capability**, because this server polls. One authority fewer than
//!   `entropy.rs` holds, and see `BUGS`.
//! - **A `Virtio` capability**, because there is no kernel-mediated transport here: that is the
//!   whole reason §86 existed.
//! - **A `DeviceFrame` or `PageFrame` capability.** The two windows were installed by the spawner
//!   before `_start` ran, so this process holds no *name* for either and can neither delegate nor
//!   remap them. Milestone 159's TRNG driver made the same choice, and its header records why an
//!   earlier draft's capability slot was describing a thing nobody hands over.
//! - **The initrd, a budget, a filesystem, a network, a clock.** None of them is here.
//!
//! # What is proven, and where
//!
//! Every piece of arithmetic is in `crates/non_volatile_memory_express`, host-tested and Kani-reachable: the ring
//! indices and the phase discipline, the doorbell offsets, the PRP pair, the identify decode, and
//! (milestone 261) the spawn handoff's round trip and the block-range check
//! [`non_volatile_memory_express::Handoff::transfer_command`] refuses outside. What is left in this file is what cannot
//! be tested without a device: volatile reads and writes, two barriers, and a bounded poll.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **One command in flight.** Each request completes before the next is submitted, so the ring
//! depth buys nothing and any throughput measured against this server is a lower bound on the
//! device rather than a measurement of it. Inherited from the kernel-resident driver this
//! replaced; notes/non-volatile-memory-express.md carries it.
//!
//! **It polls rather than waiting on an interrupt**, so a request costs a spin instead of a
//! block, and a busy server is a busy core. The controller is created with `IEN=0` and names no
//! vector (`non_volatile_memory_express::Command::create_io_cq`), so there is no interrupt to grant and switching would
//! change the admin plane as well as this file. It also keeps `Object::Irq` off this program's
//! list, which is a smaller authority, and §86's own interrupt finding is the reason not to reach
//! for MSI-X casually: this machine runs `-device intel-iommu` with no `intremap=on` and
//! `gic-version=2` with no ITS, so nothing would confine an interrupt a userspace driver aimed.
//!
//! **A hung controller presents as a timeout, not as `CSTS.CFS`.** Reading the fatal-error bit
//! means reading the controller register page, which this process deliberately cannot. So
//! [`SPIN_BOUND`] polls with no completion becomes `EIO` and the reason is lost. That is the
//! direct price of the split, and it is a worse diagnostic than the kernel-resident driver gave.
//!
//! **A confined driver can still aim DMA inside its own confinement.** The IOMMU bounds the
//! controller to the whole allocation, admin rings included, because the controller fetches from
//! both halves; so a PRP computed backwards from [`Handoff::data_plane_phys`] could make the
//! controller overwrite the admin ring. Not an escape, and §86's option 2a says so in those
//! terms; option 4's doorbell validator is what would close it.
//!
//! **A transfer is one command per filesystem block**, even when a request carries
//! [`TRANSFER_BLOCKS`] contiguous ones. `non_volatile_memory_express::prp_pair` refuses anything needing a PRP *list*
//! (notes/non-volatile-memory-express.md: "One namespace, PRP-only, no SGLs, no PRP lists"), and a 16-page transfer needs
//! one. The virtio block server issues a single request for the same range, so this server is
//! slower on bulk by construction and the fix is a PRP list rather than anything about this file.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-17 (calef, DECISIONS §154) for the whole family rather than for this
//! program alone, with the program's own half ruled on 2026-09-18 and performed the same day. The
//! argument, the refusals and what did not move are recorded once, beside the crate, in
//! `crates/non_volatile_memory_express`. Refused `nvme_server`, `nvme_driver` and
//! `non_volatile_memory_express_server`.
//!
//! **This program takes the crate's own name, and calef ruled that on 2026-09-18 rather than a
//! lane inferring it.** The obvious spelling does not exist: `non_volatile_memory_express_server`
//! is **34 bytes** against `nifefs`'s 32-byte `NAME_LEN`, which bounds a program's name and not a
//! crate's, so the family ruling could not reach this program by itself. The options were to share
//! the crate's name (27 bytes), to raise `NAME_LEN` to 40, or to name the program something else
//! entirely.
//!
//! **Raising `NAME_LEN` was refused on its cost**, which is measured rather than asserted: it is a
//! format two programs agree on, which AGENTS.md's *move fast on what can be undone* puts in the
//! expensive category, and it would take the archive from 127 entries to 106 against 87 in use
//! today and about 93 after the tracked nine-role split. The naming rules already say not to let
//! the limit pick a name and not to spend a format change on bytes nothing needs; this is the
//! second half of that.
//!
//! **What sharing buys beyond fitting.** It is the pair AGENTS.md blesses and says *means*
//! something: the crate is this program's logic, lifted out to be host-tested and Kani-reachable,
//! while the program keeps the IO, exactly as `compositor` and `line_editor` do. And it settles
//! the `_server`-versus-`_driver` split this block used to raise, by removing the suffix rather
//! than choosing between them, which puts this program with `entropy`, `clock` and `input`: named
//! for the thing, not for the role.
//!
//! **The precedent, stated because §154 will produce more of these**: a long expansion reaches a
//! program by sharing its crate's name. `acpi` and `uart` expand to 42 and 43 bytes if they are
//! ever ruled, and neither could ever name a program on its own.
//!
//! `nvme_server` was §86's name for this program in passing, and §86 said plainly that was not a
//! ratification. Two things were wrong with it. It carries the unexpanded acronym, which is what
//! the ruling is about. And it was the tree's **only** `_server` against four `_driver` programs
//! (`block_driver`, `gpu_driver`, `keyboard_driver`, `serial_driver`), drawing a distinction no
//! reader can recover from the name: `block_driver` serves a contract too, and `crates/virtio`'s
//! own prose calls that program's role *"the block server"*.
//!
//! **That inconsistency outlives this ruling and is not settled here.** `block_driver` and this
//! program will spell the same role two ways until somebody rules on the `_driver`/`_server` split
//! itself, which is calef's and is a separate question from the acronym.

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
