//! **The framebuffer driver: a screen the firmware already set up, served behind the framebuffer
//! contract** (the shell on the firmware screen; milestone 198's rung 1b).
//!
//! `gpu_driver` serves [`graphics_protocol`] by programming a virtio-gpu device. A PC has no
//! virtio-gpu, but its firmware leaves a linear framebuffer running when it hands over (milestone
//! 243: UEFI's `EFI_GRAPHICS_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL`, whose aperture outlives `ExitBootServices`). This
//! driver serves the **same contract** over that screen, so `display_terminal`, which cannot tell
//! the two apart, puts the shell on a PC's monitor with no device of our own to negotiate with.
//! Milestone 157 describes exactly this driver for the boards ("a new backend behind that same
//! contract, read a pre-set buffer instead of negotiating virtio queues"), fed there by U-Boot's
//! `simple-framebuffer` rather than by UEFI.
//!
//! # Its whole authority
//!
//! - slot 0, a **report** endpoint (`WRITE`): one `UP` message once it is serving;
//! - slot 1, the **display** endpoint (`READ`): where its one client `CALL`s `INFO` and `FLUSH`;
//! - slot 2, an **untyped**: the budget its surface mapping's page tables come out of;
//! - slot 3, the **surface**: one `PageFrame` capability naming the contract's run of RAM frames,
//!   shared with the client, which it maps itself (DECISIONS §102, milestone 108's shape);
//! - mapped before `_start`: **the covered part of the aperture**, device-typed (uncacheable on
//!   x86), at [`APERTURE_VA`]. Only the rows the surface can reach, not the whole screen
//!   (`screen_console::Aperture::span`), and as a spawn-time mapping rather than a capability, so
//!   it holds no name for the screen and cannot map it again, delegate it, or hand it on. That is
//!   the choice milestone 159's TRNG driver and milestone 261's NVMe server made for the same
//!   reason; a capability would need a `DeviceFrame` naming more than one page, which the
//!   capability surface does not have.
//!
//! No interrupt, no DMA, no transport, no physical address. The kernel tells it the geometry in its
//! three argument registers (`screen_console::Aperture::to_words`, then the aperture's offset into
//! its first page), because nothing it holds could describe it.
//!
//! # What a flush is, here
//!
//! The client draws into the surface (RAM) and says which rectangle changed. For virtio-gpu that
//! is two device commands. For a screen that is already scanning out, it is **a copy**: each pixel
//! of the rectangle is read from the surface and stored into the aperture in the screen's byte
//! order, at the screen's stride. The arithmetic is `screen_console::Aperture::copy`, host-tested
//! there. The surface lands at the screen's top-left corner, clipped to the screen when the screen
//! is the smaller of the two.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The terminal is the contract's size, not the screen's.** The surface is fixed at
//!   [`graphics_protocol::WIDTH`] by [`graphics_protocol::HEIGHT`] (924x344, a 132x43 grid), so on
//!   a 1920x1080 monitor the shell occupies the top-left corner and the rest stays black. Growing it
//!   means a surface sized at spawn rather than at compile time, which is a change to the contract
//!   and not to this driver.
//! - **Every pixel crosses an uncacheable mapping one word at a time.** A full-surface flush (every
//!   scroll) is 1.2 MB of UC stores: free under QEMU, and not measured on silicon. x86 has no
//!   write-combining here because the kernel does not program the PAT (milestone 243's `BUGS`).
//! - **One client, no arbitration.** Whoever holds the display endpoint draws; that is the
//!   contract's rung-one shape and the compositor is what multiplexes it.
//!
//! Name: **provisional** (the shell on the firmware screen's lane), in the `<device>_driver` shape
//! `gpu_driver`, `block_driver` and `keyboard_driver` take, the device being a linear framebuffer.
//! Considered `screen_driver`, which names a thing every display driver drives, and
//! `firmware_screen_driver`, which names who set it up rather than what it is and would be wrong on
//! the boards, where U-Boot sets it up.

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
