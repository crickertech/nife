//! **The session process: what keeps a user's schedule running after they disconnect**
//! (milestone 152 (durable delegation), S1 and L2 of 2026-09-26, §222 (who holds a user's
//! schedule)).
//!
//! `login` builds one of these when an authenticated identity asks for its schedule
//! (`login_protocol::SCHEDULE`). It is built out of a region split from that user's own session
//! budget, and so is the timetable it builds. Both are therefore live descendants of the budget,
//! which is the whole of what keeps the session alive once the client leaves: DECISIONS §16 (object
//! revocation) refuses `MemoryRegion::DESTROY` on a parent with a live child. Nothing new holds the
//! session up. `kernel::user::login_tests::a_login_session_with_pending_work_refuses_logout_until_the_work_is_gone`
//! proves that rule on a login budget.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! 1. Builds `timetable` from the image `login` copied in, out of [`BUDGET`]: its own region, a
//!    budget for the jobs it fires, and two endpoints. It is handed the jobs archive `login` copied
//!    in, which holds exactly the programs a scheduled job may run. The registration page `login` made
//!    ([`PAGE`]) is mapped into it at [`TIMETABLE_PAGE_VA`], so the timetable starts empty and
//!    silent and waits for a `REPLACE` (`timetable::contract`).
//! 2. Says it is ready on [`READY`], once. `login` is blocked waiting for exactly that word.
//! 3. Blocks on `e`, its one endpoint, for the rest of its life. The timetable's death arrives
//!    there, because `e` is its supervision endpoint, and so does every scheduled job's report,
//!    because `e` is also the endpoint the timetable hands each job as its report slot. A process
//!    has one wait point, and this is how one reader serves both.
//! 4. When the timetable is gone, gives [`BUDGET`]'s contents back and exits. The page stays, in
//!    `login`'s region, so `login` can read why the timetable stopped before it reclaims this
//!    process.
//!
//! **Telling a death from a report.** A death is five words from the kernel with an event of
//! `abi::fault::EVENT_EXIT` or `EVENT_FAULT`. A job can send those same numbers, so the event alone
//! decides nothing: the reap decides. Only the timetable is supervised by `e`, so `REAP` on the
//! tid a job claims answers `NotSupervised` or `StillAlive`, and the message is treated as a report.
//!
//! # Capability contract (`login_protocol::session`)
//!
//! - slot [`READY`]: `WRITE`. One readiness word, or a failure word, then never again.
//! - slot [`BUDGET`]: `WRITE | GRANT`. The timetable, its jobs, and both endpoints are built from
//!   it; `GRANT` because the timetable is handed a split of it.
//! - slot [`PAGE`]: `WRITE`. The registration page, retyped by `login` from this process's own
//!   construction region.
//! - `a0`: the length of `timetable`'s image, copied in at `login_protocol::session::TIMETABLE_VA`.
//! - `a1`: the length of the jobs archive, copied in at `login_protocol::session::JOBS_VA`.
//!
//! Name: provisional. calef ruled S1 on 2026-09-26 and gave no name; the maintainer suggested
//! `session`, and this lane shipped it on 2026-09-26. It names what the process is for a user
//! rather than what it does, which is the question the naming conventions ask first.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **A scheduled job's report is received and dropped.** Question 6 in
//!   `notes/durable-delegation.md` asks where it should go once nobody is attached; until that is
//!   answered, this process is the only reader there is, and it reads so that no job blocks for
//!   ever on its report.
//! - **Nothing restarts a timetable that faults.** The session exits, and the schedule stays on
//!   disk for the next `SCHEDULE` or the boot-time re-deriver.
//! - **The jobs archive is copied twice**, once into this process and once into the timetable, because
//!   `supervision_protocol::build_child` can hand a child data only by copying a blob or mapping a
//!   frame this process holds a capability to, and `login` hands it bytes rather than frames.
