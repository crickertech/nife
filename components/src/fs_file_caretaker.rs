//! **The file caretaker: a directory capability attenuated to one file** (milestone 31 phase 2,
//! DECISIONS §27, notes/grant-expression.md).
//!
//! Milestone 31's headline is that naming a resource in a command *is* granting it: `run wc
//! report.txt` hands `wc` one readable file and nothing else. The FS service's unit of authority is
//! a *directory* (§27: the endpoint a client holds IS the directory capability), which is more than
//! that command said. This process is the difference.
//!
//! It is a **caretaker** in Mark Miller's sense: it holds the wider capability, exports a narrower
//! one, and is the only path between them. It opens the granted name once at startup, then serves
//! the same [`filesystem_proto::fs`] protocol its own client speaks, with a namespace of exactly one name
//! and a direction it cannot widen.
//!
//! # Why this is a separate process and not a check inside the FS server
//!
//! The FS server serves one endpoint and binds it to one directory. Serving a second, narrower
//! endpoint from the same process would need the server to receive on a *set* of endpoints, which
//! this kernel does not offer and which would be a design fork to add (a badge, seL4's answer, is
//! the shape it would take). Putting the attenuation in its own process needs nothing new: it is an
//! ordinary FS client above and an ordinary FS server below.
//!
//! And it makes the claim checkable rather than asserted. The confined program holds an endpoint to
//! *this* process and nothing that names the FS server, so it cannot route around the narrowing even
//! in principle; the boundary is an address space, not a branch. That is the same reason milestone
//! 36's checker lives outside the component it checks.
//!
//! # Capability contract (`kernel/src/user/fs_service.rs`, `start_granted`)
//!
//! - **slot 0**: the FS-service endpoint, `WRITE`. The directory capability being attenuated. This
//!   is the whole of what the caretaker holds that its client does not.
//! - **slot 1**: the narrowed endpoint, `READ`. The confined program `CALL`s here; this endpoint IS
//!   the per-file capability.
//! - **slot 2**: a report endpoint, `WRITE`. Readiness, sent once the granted name is open.
//! - **[`PAGE_VA`]**: the page shared with the FS server *and* with the client. One frame, three
//!   parties, and that is sound because every request on both sides is a blocking `CALL`: the client
//!   is parked inside its call for the whole time the caretaker is using the page, so the two uses
//!   cannot interleave. A second page would buy nothing but a copy.
//!
//! The granted name and direction arrive in the three `START` argument words
//! ([`filesystem_proto::grant`]), so a per-file grant costs no extra frame and the caretaker needs nothing
//! mapped before it runs.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 61), replacing `fwarden`. Refused `fwarden` and the
//! `warden` family (a synonym invented for Mark Miller's caretaker, which DECISIONS §31 had cited
//! correctly since milestone 31 while the code said warden). The `fs_` prefix rather than `file_`
//! because `file` is already one of the qualifiers and `file_file_caretaker` is the reductio. A
//! reader should predict what the holder ends up able to do: a file, and it cannot list or create.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.

/// Every verb's answer comes from [`filesystem_proto::verb::file_grant::POLICY`], one row per opcode, in a

/// not taught them, and nothing failed. A verb with no row is now a **compile error** in `filesystem_proto`,
/// so the failure mode is inverted.
///
/// Two things the table deliberately does not flatten:
///
/// - **The direction check is derived, not listed.** [`filesystem_proto::verb::Verb::mutates`] answers "does this verb
///   change the file", so a read-only grant refuses `WRITE`, `TRUNCATE`, `SETXATTR` and
///   `REMOVEXATTR` with [`grant::EROFS`] by one rule rather than four arms, and a mutating verb
///   added to the contract is refused from the day its row exists.
/// - **Which "no" a refusal is stays visible.** `CREATE` answers [`grant::ENOTDIR`], because a file
///   capability is not a directory and the request does not *mean* anything here, which is a
///   different statement from `EACCES`'s "you were denied" (there is no policy to have said yes).
