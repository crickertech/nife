//! The least-authority demo: a whole program in one job.
//!
//! Milestone 19f.2, the first program that is its **own binary** rather than a role of `hello`.
//! init loads it out of the initrd archive by the name `"least_authority_demo"` (nifefs), builds a
//! child address space and TCB at this ELF's own entry, and `START`s it with the input `n` in `x1`.
//! It squares `n`, `SEND`s the answer on the one endpoint init granted it (slot 0), and exits.
//! That is the entire program: no role byte to dispatch on, no capabilities beyond the single one
//! it needs. Least authority made real, because the program *is* its authority, and the squaring is
//! arbitrary.
//!
//! It shares `components`' linker script (`crates/user_rt/link.ld`, linked at `0x40_0000`, in its
//! own address space, so the shared load address is not a conflict) but not one line of hello's
//! code: a distinct ELF with its own `_start` and panic handler. The syscall runtime
//! (`send`/`exit`) comes from the shared `user_rt` crate, lifted out at 19f.6 once all the split
//! binaries existed.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-13 (calef, working the unratified worklist). Refused `worker` (a generic
//! word of the kind AGENTS.md flags beside `compose` and `measure`: in a kernel tree it could name
//! a thread-pool member, a scheduler entity or a job, and this tree spends the English word on all
//! three), `demo_square` (the header above says the squaring is arbitrary and the authority is the
//! point, so naming it after the arithmetic drops the point; `demo` is also a generic word with no
//! precedent here, and `square` is a verb where the noun rule wants a thing), `squarer` (a noun and
//! honest, but it is the fixture reading this ruling rejected), `least_authority` (the same name one
//! word shorter; calef took the longer form, which says it is a demonstration rather than a claim
//! about the program's own authority). The ruling also settled a classification three records had
//! made by repetition rather than by ruling (`notes/naming.md`, milestones 39 and 175 all listed it
//! as a fixture): it is the canonical minimal program, so milestone 175 moved it into `components/`
//! rather than `fixtures/`, and performed the rename in the same change.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
