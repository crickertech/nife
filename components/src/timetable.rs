//! **The timetable: scheduled execution where every entry is a grant** (milestone 129).
//!
//! A cron, and the inversion of one. Unix cron reads a text file and runs arbitrary commands as
//! ambient authority made periodic: whatever the crontab says happens, with the account's whole
//! reach behind it, and the crontab is therefore the attack surface. This reads a text file too and
//! the file looks similar, but an entry's command is a **grant expression** checked at registration
//! by `grant_plan::plan`, the same function the shell checks a prompt line with. What a scheduled
//! child holds is planned, printed, and fixed before the first tick.
//!
//! **The claim, in one sentence:** compromising this process yields the entries' summed endowments,
//! not the system, because there is no ambient authority for a scheduled child to fall back on and
//! this process holds nothing it was not handed.
//!
//! # What it holds, and that is the whole list
//!
//! The slots and arguments are `timetable::contract`'s, which a session spawning this reads too.
//!
//! - slot 0: the output endpoint (WRITE). Where the plan and the summary go, as `byte_sink_protocol`
//!   bytes. Never touched with a registration page, when everything goes into the page instead.
//! - slot 1: an untyped budget (WRITE). What every instance is made of, what pays for the loader's
//!   own scratch mappings, and what a `--mem` entry's grant is carved from (nested inside that
//!   instance's own region rather than split from this budget directly; see `fire` and `BUGS`).
//! - slot 2: the child report endpoint (WRITE|GRANT), handed to each instance as its slot 0.
//! - slot 3: the supervision endpoint (READ|GRANT), placed in each instance's reserved fault slot
//!   so every scheduled child is born supervised (DECISIONS §26), and invoked with
//!   `Rendezvous::REAP` to collect the corpses (§32).
//! - `a0`: how many fires to perform before summarising and exiting. `0` means forever.
//! - `a2`: where a registration page is mapped, or `0` for none (milestone 129 (scheduled execution), §222 (who holds a
//!   user's schedule)). With none, the document is the compiled-in `timetable.conf`. With one, the
//!   timetable starts empty and its document is whatever a registrar last sent with `REPLACE`; see
//!   `timetable::registration` and "Replacement" below.
//! - `a1`: the length of the archive the spawn site mapped read-only at
//!   [`user_mode_runtime::initrd::INITRD_VA`]. **Not the initrd**: it holds exactly the programs this
//!   document will ever build, because the plan is computable before the first tick and so the
//!   endowment can be narrowed to it. This process audits that and says what it found, in the
//!   line after the plan.
//!
//! **It wants a bigger stack than a small program does**, and a spawn site has to say so: a
//! `grant_plan::Endowment` is about a kilobyte (mostly the name set a directory grant can carry) and
//! the plan holds one per entry, so the working set is tens of kilobytes rather than hundreds of
//! bytes. `kernel/src/user/timetable_tests.rs` maps 32 pages and says why; eight died with a data
//! abort whose faulting address was the stack pointer, which is what a stack overflow looks like
//! from the kernel side and reads like a wild pointer if you have not seen it before.
//!
//! **And nothing else beyond that budget.** No clock page, no directory, no console, no network, no
//! device. That list is not modesty: it is why a scheduled `date` in `timetable.conf` is refused at
//! registration rather than run, and why the refusal names the timetable rather than the line.
//! `timetable::SHIPPED_HELD` is the one fact that has widened since milestone 129's first stratum:
//! this process now holds enough budget to back a `--mem` grant up to `SHIPPED_HELD.mem_pages`
//! pages for a single entry, and `timetable.conf`'s `at-boot memory_grant_depleter --mem 4` line is the proof.
//!
//! # The archive is narrowed to the plan, and this process says so
//!
//! `Registry::programs` is the complete set of programs the document will ever start, and it is
//! known before anything fires. So the spawn site builds an archive of exactly that set and hands
//! *that* over, rather than the initrd: after milestone 129's second stratum this process cannot
//! load `date`, `ps`, `swish` or anything else it will never run, even though it holds a working
//! image loader.
//!
//! It cannot narrow its own endowment, so what it does instead is **measure it** and print the
//! answer next to the plan (`timetable::Audit`). A scheduler handed the whole initrd still works
//! and says a different sentence, which is the property worth having: the width of the endowment is
//! a line on the console rather than a fact only the spawn site knows.
//!
//! # The loop, and the one thing it cannot do
//!
//! Poll the monotonic counter (ambient, `user_mode_runtime::monotonic_nanos`, no capability); fire what is
//! due; when the budget cannot back another instance, block on the supervision endpoint until a
//! corpse arrives and reclaim its region. That last step is the only blocking wait in the program,
//! which matters because **this kernel has exactly one wait point per process and no timed wait at
//! all** (milestone 106 is `NOT-STARTED` and gated on a decision). See `BUGS`.
//!
//! # Replacement
//!
//! A timetable spawned with a registration page is changed while it runs, by its session replacing
//! the whole document (§222). The loop checks the page's request word once per pass, which is one
//! load, and it has to be a poll: a blocking receive would stop it watching the clock (see
//! `timetable::registration`). A replacement is parsed, registered and resolved against the archive
//! in full before anything changes, so one that fails leaves the schedule in force running and
//! says why in the page. One that succeeds keeps the beat of every line it did not change, writes
//! its plan into the page, and re-arms. With a page, the page is the registrar's whole view: this
//! process says nothing down [`OUT`], and leaves its exit code in the page when it stops (see
//! [`PAGE`] and `timetable::contract`).
//!
//! Children already running when their entry is removed finish and are reaped as usual, because
//! the counts of outstanding children belong to the loop and not to the document.
//!
//! An empty replacement ends the process. Its session is kept alive by its live children (§16
//! (object revocation)), so a timetable left idling with nothing to fire would hold the session up
//! for no job at all. It answers, drains what is running, prints its summary, and exits.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-13 (calef, working the unratified worklist), with `crates/timetable` and
//! `components/timetable.conf` in one ruling, which is what a crate-and-program pair means. See the
//! crate's module docs for the argument and the refusals. Milestone 129's own block declined to
//! propose a name and said the eventual one was calef's.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **It spins between fires, and that is a missing kernel primitive rather than a lazy loop.**
//!   There is no sleep, no timeout and no deadline anywhere in this kernel, so a process that wants
//!   to act at a time can only yield and re-read the counter. `Registry::next_deadline` already
//!   computes exactly what a timed wait would block until, so the fix is one line here once
//!   milestone 106's fork is decided; until then a running timetable costs a core's worth of yields.
//!   **This program is that fork's fifth consumer** (the block counts four: `net_stack`'s retransmit
//!   window, milestone 51's `thread::sleep`, `RECV`'s no-timeout limitation, and the shell's `^C`
//!   poll), and it is the first one whose *whole purpose* is to act at a time.
//!
//! - **Corpses are collected lazily, when their memory is needed.** Nothing reaps between fires,
//!   because reaping means blocking on the supervision endpoint and blocking means not watching the
//!   clock. So the failure counts this program reports lag reality until the budget runs down.
//!   A wait that returns on either a message or a deadline fixes this too, and it is the same fork.
//!
//! - **A hung scheduled child stops the whole timetable.** When the budget cannot back another
//!   instance the loop blocks on the supervision endpoint, and a livelocked child never sends a
//!   death message, so nothing arrives and nothing else fires. That is §32's watchdog case verbatim
//!   (`Rendezvous::REAP` collects corpses and refuses to kill, deliberately) and it is not this
//!   program's to fix: it waits for milestone 23. What it costs here is worth stating, because it is
//!   worse than it is for a shell: at a prompt the person who typed the command is sitting there and
//!   can press `^C`, and behind a schedule there is nobody.
//!
//! - **The archive holds every image the plan builds, and that is code, not authority.** A
//!   compromised timetable can load any program in its archive, not only the one an entry names.
//!   It gains nothing by it: a job holds exactly what `fire` or `fire_with_grant` endows, and
//!   nothing reads which image is running to decide that, so a second image adds only code to a
//!   process already running the attacker's. One image per entry was refused on 2026-09-26 for
//!   this reason (notes/scheduled-execution/one-image-per-entry.md).
//!
//! - **`--mem` entries are backed, and run one at a time, alone.** The roadmap's first sketch said
//!   to split the grant out of the instance's own region "so a single `DESTROY` still reclaims
//!   both", and that is wrong on its own terms: `regions::destroy_outcome` returns `Refused` for
//!   any region with a live child, Kani proves it, and `sched::reap_supervised` hands that refusal
//!   straight back, so a corpse whose region carries a nested grant can never be collected through
//!   `reap` until the grant is destroyed first, by its own separate capability.
//!
//!   The nesting survives the correction for a better reason: it is the only thing that can ever
//!   pair a death with a grant, because a builder is never told its child's tid
//!   (`supervision_protocol::build_child` hands back a TCB capability, and `abi::thread_control_block`
//!   has no method that reads one out), so the only fact this process has about a death is the tid
//!   the kernel stamped on it. `fire_with_grant` keeps the split untyped's own capability rather
//!   than `cap_delete`-ing it the way it does the region and the TCB, so `collect_grant` can destroy
//!   it later, by name.
//!
//!   **What decides *how many* `--mem` instances may be outstanding at once is that correlation,
//!   and the answer taken here is one.** A generation counter or a slot table could track more, but
//!   nothing here needs its child's tid for any other reason, so paying for one would be
//!   speculative machinery for a milestone whose document schedules exactly one such entry. With
//!   one, the pairing needs no bookkeeping at all: `_start` drains everything already outstanding,
//!   fires the grant-bearing instance alone, and blocks in `collect_grant` until it dies and its
//!   grant is reclaimed before returning to the loop. Nothing else in the document can be firing
//!   while that wait is blocked, which is what makes the next death on `DEATHS` unambiguous.
//!
//!   **The cost is real and is paid by every other entry, not by `--mem` ones.** While a grant is
//!   outstanding this process is blocked in one syscall and cannot poll the clock at all, so an
//!   interval entry due during that window is not skipped, it simply runs late once the loop
//!   resumes; several periods elapsing during a slow instance still produce one fire on resumption
//!   (`next_after`'s ordinary skip-not-catch-up rule, not a special case for this path).
//!   `timetable.conf`'s `at-boot memory_grant_depleter --mem 4` fires before the first `every 150ms` tick can
//!   even become due, so this cost is not exercised by the cross-ISA test; a document whose
//!   `--mem` entry shares the clock with a fast interval would pay it.
//!
//! - **Without a registration page, the document is compiled in.** `include_str!`, and the shipped
//!   boot-time test still runs that way. With a page the document is whatever the registrar sent,
//!   and persisting it is the registrar's job (§222's fifth sub-ruling: the session writes
//!   `crates/schedule_store`'s file, then replaces). No session registers into a timetable yet,
//!   because the durable session is for milestone 152 (durable delegation) to rebuild; the kernel test stands in.
//!
//! - **A registration is noticed by polling, not received.** The loop loads the page's request
//!   word once per pass. A `RECV` would block and stop the clock being watched, because a process
//!   has one wait point and there is no timed wait (milestone 106 (a wait that ends on either the interrupt or the deadline)). The cost is one load per pass
//!   on a loop that already spins; a deadline wait that also ends on a notification removes it.
//!
//! - **A replacement's printed plan is cut at the page**, at `timetable::registration::BODY_MAX`
//!   bytes, and with a registrar the page is the only place it goes. Eight entries of long
//!   refusals could pass that; the verdict word still says what every entry became.
//!
//! - **With a registrar, a fire failure is only an exit code.** "The budget cannot back one
//!   instance" has no stream to go down, so the registrar learns it from the page's exit word
//!   (`contract::E_BUDGET`) after reaping this process.
//!
//! - **The archive audit is printed only for the compiled-in document.** With a registrar, the
//!   archive is what the session lets its jobs run, not the plan of a document that has not
//!   arrived, so "exactly the programs its plan names" is not the right sentence to measure.
