//! **Minting a rendezvous out of our own memory**, milestone 19a.
//!
//! Holds a memory region (slot 0), a channel (slot 1), and nothing else. It retypes a page of its
//! own region into a brand-new rendezvous object (`RETYPE_OBJ`), one no kernel wiring created, then
//! delegates a READ view of it over the channel and SENDs a word into it.
//!
//! If the kernel's object really works, a peer this program has never met receives that word over
//! a rendezvous that did not exist a moment ago. The `SEND` blocks until the peer receives, so
//! reaching `exit` is itself half the proof.
//!
//! The other half is `rendezvous_peer`; the wiring is `kernel/src/user/retype_ep_service.rs`.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 291). This was `hello`'s `EP_MAKER` role, number 17. `ep` is an
//! abbreviation that needs a decoder, which is the first of AGENTS.md's three naming failure
//! modes, and the object's own name in this tree is `RENDEZVOUS` (`abi::objtype::RENDEZVOUS`,
//! `rendezvous_cap`). Refused `rendezvous_maker`: "minting" is the word this tree already uses for
//! creating a capability out of a budget, and it appears in the kernel test's own sentence.

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
