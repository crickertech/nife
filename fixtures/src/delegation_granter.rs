//! **The delegation demo, the half that gives**, milestone 10.
//!
//! Holds a channel to send over (slot 0) and a resource capability held `WRITE | GRANT` (slot 1).
//! It passes the resource on, narrowed to `WRITE` so the receiver can use it but cannot lend it
//! further. The whole point of a capability system, in four lines: authority a process holds,
//! handed to another process, at runtime, with less power than it arrived with.
//!
//! The other half is `delegation_receiver`; the wiring and the assertions are
//! `kernel/src/user/delegation_service.rs` and `kernel::user::tests`.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 291). This was `hello`'s `GRANTER` role, number 9. Qualified with
//! `delegation_` because `granter` alone is one of AGENTS.md's generic words: half this system
//! grants something to something. Refused `capability_granter`: every capability in this tree is a
//! capability, so the word distinguishes nothing, where `delegation` names the specific act
//! (`SEND_CAP` over a channel) this program exists to perform.
