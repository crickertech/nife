//! **An ordinary program that wants to print**, milestone 8.
//!
//! It does not own a UART and cannot reach one. It writes its text into a page it *shares* with
//! the console server and sends the length over an endpoint. That is the whole of "printing" in
//! this system.
//!
//! # Why the bytes travel in shared memory and the length travels in a message
//!
//! DECISIONS §10: **IPC carries control, shared memory carries data.** The kernel is not in the
//! data path at all. It never sees the bytes, never copies them, never validates a pointer into
//! them. The confused-deputy problem that milestone 7d had to defend against **cannot arise
//! here**, because the thing that could be confused (a kernel doing I/O for a user) no longer
//! exists. The architecture dissolved the bug.
//!
//! It checks its own image first ([`loaded_image_check`]) and kills itself if any part of it is
//! wrong, which is what lets `a_user_client_moves_data_through_shared_memory` assert on the
//! absence of a fault as well as on the bytes.
//!
//! The server it talks to is `components/src/console.rs`, its own binary since 19f.3.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 291). This was `hello`'s `PRINTING` role, number 2. Follows the
//! `*_test_client` shape the tree already uses for a fixture that drives a real service
//! (`fs_test_client`, `login_test_client`, `credentialer_test_client`, `socket_test_client`).
//! Refused `printing_client`, which is what the role was called: a verb-participle where every
//! other client here is named for the service it drives, and the `_test_` is what says this is a
//! fixture rather than the console's real client (the shell is that).

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
