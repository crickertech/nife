//! **Reach the network from a booted system's prompt** (milestone 590 (the booted system starts
//! its network stack)).
//!
//! Opens a TCP connection to the QEMU runners' echo peer (`socket_protocol::fixture::ECHO_PEER_IP`,
//! port `ECHO_PEER_PORT`), sends [`MSG`], reads what comes back, and prints it:
//!
//! ```text
//! nife> network_echo_client --mem 4
//! echo peer 10.0.2.9:7777 answered: nife-net!
//! ```
//!
//! Every network test before this one started `net_stack` from the kernel's test harness, so none
//! of them said anything about the system a person boots. This program is spawned by the real
//! progenitor, through the real spawn service, holding exactly what its manifest
//! (`grant_plan::Prog::NetworkEchoClient`) declares, and it talks to the `net_stack` the progenitor
//! built at boot. A green `script/swish-check` line for it is the claim.
//!
//! A fixture and not a tool, because the peer it talks to exists only inside a QEMU runner. The
//! package client milestone 198 (a package manager) needs is the first real program that will
//! declare the same manifest field.
//!
//! # What this program holds
//!
//! - slot 0: its output, the sink contract (`crates/byte_sink_protocol`).
//! - slot 1: the `--mem` budget, which it mints the one page it trades bytes with the stack
//!   through out of. The network grant carries no memory, so a socket client pays for its own page.
//! - slot 10 ([`grant_plan::NETWORK_SLOT`]): `WRITE` on the stack's endpoint, the right to `CALL`
//!   the socket contract. Placed there by the progenitor because the manifest declares
//!   `network`, and empty on a boot whose progenitor built no stack (`x86_64`, or any run with
//!   `NIFE_NET` unset), in which case this prints why and sends nothing.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! **It uses socket number 0, and so does any other client of the same stack.** The socket
//! contract names a socket by a small integer every client shares (`socket_protocol::MAX_SOCKETS`),
//! so two network programs alive at once would operate each other's sockets. Nothing at this prompt
//! runs two today; milestone 590's block records the limitation and what fixing it would change.
//!
//! Name: provisional. Introduced 2026-09-24 for milestone 590; says what it talks to, and expects
//! to be retired rather than renamed once a real network tool can stand in for it.
