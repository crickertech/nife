//! **Nine roles of milestone 19d and 19e: a userspace parent that builds children out of ELFs it
//! parsed.** Which one runs is chosen by the word the kernel puts in `x0` at `_start`, the way a
//! real kernel hands a new process its argc.
//!
//! Six of them are the parent. `INIT` builds a plain child; `INIT_DEV` builds one and hands it a
//! device's registers; `INIT_IRQ` builds one and delegates it an interrupt; `INIT_CONSOLE` builds
//! the real console server and then plays its client; `INIT_LEAST_AUTHORITY_DEMO` and
//! `INIT_COREMARK` build programs they did not write and start them with an argument. Three are
//! the children those roles build: `CHILD` reports a word, `DEV_CHILD` reads a device's identity
//! registers, `IRQ_CHILD` blocks on an interrupt.
//!
//! **The name is wrong and the rename is calef's** (see the limitation below). What is left here
//! is not a greeting and has not been since 19d.
//!
//! # The principle this file is the exception to
//!
//! **A program does one thing, and a role is an exception that has to say why.** The tree enacted
//! that rule five times without ever writing it down: the least-authority demo left in 19f.2, the
//! console in 19f.3, the input driver in 19f.4, the shell in 19f.5, and `init_boot` in 266. Five
//! departures, each recorded in its own file as a local fix, and no principle anywhere; so the
//! sixth arm anybody wanted to add had nothing to read that said not to. Milestone 291 deleted
//! seven more roles, split fourteen into programs, and states the rule here, where a reader meets
//! the last binary in this tree still dispatching on `x0`.
//!
//! **Why these nine are the exception, for now.** Six of them build a child out of an ELF, and
//! three of them *are* that child: the parent finds its child by looking *itself* up in the
//! archive ([`ROLES_ENTRY`]) and re-entering its own image at a different role. Splitting the
//! parents from the children means each parent naming its child's archive entry instead, which
//! changes what `kernel::user::spawn_hello` has to know: today it always re-enters this binary,
//! and six roles becoming six programs means it would have to name an entry per role instead.
//! That is a boot-path change rather than a fixtures change, and it is the one piece 291 did not
//! take. See
//! `design/roadmap/291-one-program-one-job.md`.
//!
//! # Bugs
//!
//! **The name does not describe the contents, and this block used to claim otherwise.** Until
//! milestone 291 it read *"The limitation that used to be recorded here is closed (milestone
//! 266)"*, on the grounds that 266 had moved the boot role out. 266 moved **one** role out and
//! thirty-one remained, so the claim was false on the day it was written and stayed false for
//! three weeks. What is here now is nine roles of userspace process construction, which `hello`
//! describes no better than it described thirty-one. calef deferred the new name until there was
//! something settled to name (2026-09-14: *"If there is anything left then we can consider a name
//! for what remains"*); this is what is left.
//!
//! **A caller that asks for a role this binary does not have gets a trap**, which is deliberate
//! (the `_` arm used to run the self-checker and report success), but it is a trap rather than a
//! message: the kernel counts a fault and the spawner waiting on a report waits until its
//! watchdog. Nothing here can do better, because a program entered at a role it does not have may
//! not hold a capability to report on.
//!
//! Name: unrecorded, and overdue. Nobody wrote down why `hello` is called `hello` and nobody
//! needed to while it was a first program: it is the universal name for one, and this was the
//! first program this kernel ever loaded, on 2026-07-14. It has not been a first program since
//! milestone 19d and stopped being a catalogue at 291; the rename is calef's and is deferred until
//! there is something settled to name. See the `# Bugs` section above.
