//! **The delegation demo, the half that takes**, milestone 10.
//!
//! Holds the channel (slot 0), a report endpoint (slot 1), and a loopback endpoint (slot 2) it
//! uses only to *attempt* re-delegation. It receives the delegated capability, proves it works by
//! invoking it, then proves it cannot pass it on.
//!
//! Three things must hold and this reports on all three: the capability arrives, it carries real
//! authority when a process that did not mint it invokes it, and the kernel refuses to let it
//! travel further because it was handed over without `GRANT`.
//!
//! The other half is `delegation_granter`.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 291). This was `hello`'s `RECEIVER` role, number 10. See
//! `delegation_granter` for why the qualifier: `receiver` alone could name almost anything that
//! holds the read end of a channel.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
