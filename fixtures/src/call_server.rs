//! **The Call/Reply server**, milestone 12.
//!
//! Holds `RECV` on a request endpoint (slot 0) and a report endpoint (slot 1). It answers one
//! caller it was never individually wired to, then proves the reply capability is one-shot by
//! trying to use it a second time and reporting that the kernel refused.
//!
//! That refusal is the property a pre-wired reply rendezvous cannot give you. The reply capability
//! is minted by the kernel at the moment of the call, names the caller, and is consumed on first
//! use; nothing the server holds outlives the one answer it owed.
//!
//! The other half is `call_client`; the wiring is `kernel/src/user/call_service.rs`.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 291). This was `hello`'s `CALL_SERVER` role, number 14, and
//! matches the kernel-side module that wires it. "Call" here is the IPC operation's own name
//! (`user_rt::call`, `abi`'s `CALL`), which is the "standard term a reader already knows" case
//! AGENTS.md's naming section protects rather than a generic verb.

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
