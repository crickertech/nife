//! **The login service's test client** (milestone 49; see `components/src/login.rs`).
//!
//! **One binary, one endowment, and two separate things a run is handed: a behaviour and a
//! credential** (milestone 293). It shares `credentialer_test_client`'s reason for being one
//! program rather than several (a program that shares the honest path with an attempted-wrong-secret
//! run is a fairer test of a refusal than a different program failing for its own reasons), but it
//! delivers that by construction rather than by convention: the wrong-secret run is not a separate
//! arm that could drift away from the honest one, it is [`LOGIN`] with a different secret.
//!
//! Until 293 this file had **eleven roles** and its first act was a lookup from role number to a
//! pair of byte strings. Five of the eleven ran byte-identical code and differed only in that pair
//! (`chris`, `corinne`, the same `chris` with a wrong secret, a `graeme` with no home subtree, and a
//! `corinne` presenting a real credential while the terminal was on loan), and two more differed
//! only in which identity they wrote into a marker file. A role that differs only in its credentials
//! is not a role.
//!
//! So a run is `_start(behaviour, identity, secret)`:
//!
//! - **`behaviour`** is what this process does with the session it gets, and the six below are six
//!   genuinely different flows rather than six spellings of one.
//! - **`identity` and `secret`** are indices into [`credential_protocol::fixture::PEOPLE`], the roster
//!   three files used to keep their own copy of. They are composed at the call site, so
//!   `(CHRIS, CHRIS)` is an honest login and `(CHRIS, WRONG)` is the same program presenting a
//!   secret that is nobody's. [`FREE_TERMINAL`] takes `(NONE, NONE)` and authenticates nothing.
//!
//! Every behaviour holds the identical endowment: the login service's front-door request endpoint,
//! its front-door result endpoint, a report endpoint, and a small scratch region (milestone 49's
//! channel-per-client update: a run must map the page [`login_protocol::CONNECTED`] delegates before it
//! holds anything else of its own to draw page tables from).
//!
//! # The six behaviours
//!
//! - [`LOGIN`] presents the credential it was handed and stops at the verdict, then proves what it
//!   received. Every credential case is this one behaviour: two identities' correct credentials
//!   (both must succeed, and the kernel test compares what each received; two distinct caretaker
//!   endpoints is the channel-shaped attribution DECISIONS §109 decided on), a real identity with
//!   the wrong secret (must be refused, and nothing may follow: this behaviour never calls
//!   `RECV_CAP` after a refusal, because the protocol promises nothing does on a denial and a client
//!   that tried would block forever), a real authenticated identity nobody provisioned a subtree for
//!   (refused identically, DECISIONS §117's "no distinguishable signal" answer; see `login.rs`'s own
//!   BUGS), and a real credential presented while [`HOLD_TERMINAL`]'s loan is outstanding (refused
//!   [`login_protocol::NO_TERMINAL`], which the same "nothing follows a refusal" flow covers for free
//!   since `NO_TERMINAL != OK`).
//! - [`WRITE_MARKER`] (DECISIONS §117) logs in and then, through the delegated directory, `CREATE`s
//!   a one-shot marker file naming **the identity it was handed**, and checks that
//!   [`filesystem_protocol::fixture::tree::INNER`] is *not* there (that name lives only in the old,
//!   shared fixture subtree every identity used to be attenuated to before §117; its absence is this
//!   client's own proof that the granted directory is not that one). Two identities run it; it is
//!   one behaviour because the only thing that differed was the name it wrote, and that name is now
//!   an argument.
//! - [`READ_MARKER`] logs in in a second, independent channel and reads the marker back: the kernel
//!   test compares what it reads against what each [`WRITE_MARKER`] run wrote, which is the whole
//!   property under test: two different identities land in two different, isolated subtrees, and the
//!   same identity's two sessions land in the *same* one.
//! - [`LOGOUT`] logs in, proves the directory works exactly like [`LOGIN`] does, then calls
//!   `MemoryRegion::DESTROY` on the fourth delegated capability (`login_protocol`'s own logout ticket)
//!   and proves the *directory* came down with it: a further `READDIR` through it must fail. This is
//!   milestone 49's caretaker-teardown fix, proven end to end rather than merely by the syscall's own
//!   return code. It reports how long that `DESTROY` waited (microseconds) in the third report word,
//!   where the others put an identity hint; see `destroy_with_retry`.
//! - [`HOLD_TERMINAL`] (milestone 49's terminal update) logs in, proves the fifth delegated
//!   capability (the terminal) actually names a real, working endpoint by sending a known word
//!   through it (which the kernel test catches with its own `sched::ipc_recv` on the stand-in
//!   `Wiring::term_ep`, the same "prove it works, not merely that it arrived" standard the directory
//!   and budget already get), then tears its own session down exactly like [`LOGOUT`] -- but,
//!   deliberately, **without** sending [`login_protocol::logout_word`], so the terminal itself stays on
//!   loan even though the session's memory came home. That is the property under test: session
//!   teardown and freeing the terminal are two independent acts.
//! - [`FREE_TERMINAL`] sends [`login_protocol::logout_word`] on the front door directly, without ever
//!   calling `CONNECT`: there is no identity or secret in this word at all (`login_protocol`'s own BUGS
//!   on what this does and does not authenticate). It is the one behaviour that takes no credential,
//!   and it says so with [`credential_protocol::fixture::NONE`] rather than by convention.
//!
//! A run that succeeds does not stop at the verdict. It **uses** what it received: a directory
//! read through the caretaker's endpoint, the file service's shared frame mapped and used for that
//! read, and a page retyped from the delegated budget. A capability that arrived but does not work
//! would pass every earlier assertion and fail only this one.
//!
//! # Capability contract
//!
//! - slot 0: the login service's front-door request endpoint, `WRITE`. Carries exactly one word
//!   this program ever sends: [`login_protocol::connect_word`].
//! - slot 1: the login service's front-door result endpoint, `READ`. [`login_protocol::CONNECTED`],
//!   then three delegated capabilities: a private request endpoint, a private result endpoint, and
//!   a staging page. The actual [`login_protocol::LOGIN`] exchange happens on the first two of those,
//!   never on slots 0/1 again. [`login_protocol::logout_word`] also travels here directly ([`FREE_TERMINAL`]),
//!   since it needs no private channel at all.
//! - slot 2: a report endpoint, `WRITE`.
//! - slot 3: a small `MemoryRegion`, `WRITE`: this program's own scratch, for `map_page_frame`'s
//!   page-table cost when it self-maps the page [`login_protocol::CONNECTED`] delegates (see
//!   `kernel::user::login_service::CLIENT_SCRATCH_UT_PAGES`).
//! - `a0`: the behaviour.
//! - `a1`: the identity, an index into [`credential_protocol::fixture::PEOPLE`].
//! - `a2`: the secret: the same index for that person's own, [`credential_protocol::fixture::WRONG`]
//!   for one that is nobody's, [`credential_protocol::fixture::NONE`] for no credential at all.
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! - **The identity and the secret travel as indices, not as bytes, because nothing in this tree can
//!   hand a `no_std` program a string it was not compiled against.** A process is born with three
//!   integer registers, a capability list and a set of mappings (`kernel::user::Spawn`), and that is
//!   the whole of it: `grant_plan::ArgSpec` carries exactly one *integer*, `environment_protocol`'s
//!   config page is validated against curated domains precisely so a secret cannot ride on it, and
//!   a page of bytes needs a frame the spawner allocates, writes and maps. So the bytes live in a
//!   crate both sides link and the register names which one. That is enough for a fixture and is not
//!   a credential-passing mechanism: a real program needs a capability to something that holds the
//!   secret, which is DECISIONS §41's answer and already what `login` itself uses.
//! - **A spawn argument is visible wherever a spawn is recorded.** These indices are not, which is
//!   an accident of them being small integers rather than a property anything enforces; had the
//!   bytes themselves gone into the register the same argument would print. `swish`'s `caps` preview
//!   reads a manifest and this program has none (it is spawned by the kernel test harness, not by
//!   the shell), so nothing prints them today. Nothing here is a design for carrying real secrets.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-14 (calef, milestone 293), **on the name and not the shape**: the same
//! ruling minted 293 to decide what the eleven roles should have been, so that this file's shape
//! could be fixed without the name blocking it. Minted 2026-08-22 for milestone 49 on the
//! `<service>_test_client` pattern, which was not that lane's invention: calef signed that exact
//! shape for the credential service, turning down `credcli` as a squished abbreviation and
//! `credentialer_client` because that name belongs to the real client a later milestone needs. The
//! same reservation holds here, so a future real login client is not squatted.

/// thread's next preemption, so the wait is a tick period (10 ms at 100 Hz) rather than a number of
/// syscalls. A `yield_now` that finds work on this core returns in ~130 us, so sixty-four of them
/// can elapse in 8 ms and give up **before the tick that does the work arrives**; a `yield_now`
/// that finds none parks until the next tick, and then two attempts are enough. Which of the two
