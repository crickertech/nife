//! **The frame demo, the half that receives**, milestone 19.
//!
//! Receives the delegated frame, maps the same physical page read-only, reads the producer's
//! sentinel back (proof the memory is shared), and confirms it cannot map the page writable,
//! because it was handed the frame with `READ` alone.
//!
//! The verdict it reports is two bits: bit 0 the sentinel was read, bit 1 a writable mapping was
//! refused. `kernel::user::tests` asserts both, separately, so a failure says which half broke.
//!
//! The other half is `page_frame_producer`.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 291). This was `hello`'s `PAGE_FRAME_CONSUMER` role, number 12.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
