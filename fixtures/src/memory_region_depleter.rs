//! **Spend an untyped budget until it is gone**, milestone 11.
//!
//! This process holds a capability to a chunk of raw memory (slot 0) and a report endpoint
//! (slot 1). It maps page after page out of that memory region into its own address space, writes
//! and reads each one to prove it is real, and keeps going until the region is exhausted. Then it
//! reports how many it mapped.
//!
//! **The whole point is what the KERNEL does while this runs: nothing.** Every page here comes out
//! of the region, so the kernel's free-frame count does not move. A process cannot make the kernel
//! allocate, so it cannot exhaust it. `kernel::user::tests` checks exactly that, by reading the
//! frame count on either side of the run.
//!
//! # Bugs
//!
//! **It must not exit**, unlike every other one-shot fixture here, and that is a foot gun rather
//! than a design. The test reads the kernel's used-frame count the instant the report lands, and
//! exiting would tear this address space down inside that same window, so the number read would be
//! the teardown's rather than the measurement's. Spinning holds the state still until the
//! assertion has looked at it. The cost is that nothing reaps this thread on its own:
//! `memory_region_service::start` returns the `ThreadId` for that reason, and a caller that drops
//! the name has leaked a spinning thread onto every test that runs after it.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 291). This was `hello`'s `UNTYPED_DEMO` role, number 7, whose
//! function was already called `memory_region_demo` after the untyped-to-memory-region rename.
//! Matches `memory_grant_depleter`, the milestone-31 program that does the same thing to a grant
//! rather than to a region, which is the analogous case this tree already named. Refused
//! `memory_region_demo`: "demo" says why it was written rather than what it does, and every
//! program in this directory is a demonstration of something.
