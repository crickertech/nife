//! **The client that draws** (milestone 29, the display ladder's rung one).
//!
//! This process paints a pattern into a framebuffer and asks for it to be shown. It holds:
//!
//! - slot 0, a **report** endpoint: its verdict goes to whoever spawned it;
//! - slot 1, a **display** endpoint (WRITE): it CALLs the driver here;
//! - slot 2, an **untyped**: the budget the page tables for its own mappings come out of;
//! - slot 3, the **surface**: one `PageFrame` capability naming the whole `gfx::SURFACE_PAGE_FRAMES`-page
//!   run (DECISIONS §102), which it maps itself in one call (milestone 108; before that the kernel
//!   mapped them in at spawn and the client held nothing that said so).
//!
//! And that is all. It holds no `Virtio` capability, no interrupt, no device mapping, and it cannot
//! name a physical address; it has never heard of virtio-gpu. The pixels are the only memory it
//! shares with anything. So the worst a hostile version of this program can do is draw nonsense: it
//! cannot program a queue, cannot ring a doorbell, and cannot aim a device at a byte it does not
//! already own. That is the separation rung two (the compositor) is built on, and the reason this
//! trivial program is a separate binary rather than a function inside the driver.
//!
//! # What it proves
//!
//! It paints [`graphics_proto::pixel`], a per-coordinate function rather than a fill, then flushes, then
//! **reads the whole surface back and digests it**. The digest and the index of the first wrong pixel
//! go to the report endpoint, where the kernel test compares them against a value it computed itself
//! from the contract. So a pass means the pattern this process wrote is the pattern that was in the
//! frames the device read, byte for byte, and the driver agreed about it from its own address space.
//! See notes/framebuffer-contract.md for what that does and does not prove about the screen.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-07-30 (calef, DECISIONS §39), among the names recorded there as always
//! right.
