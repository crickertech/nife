//! **The Rust shell around a C component** (milestone 36, DECISIONS §31).
//!
//! This is the load-bearing piece of the seam, and what it does *not* do is the design. It holds
//! every capability, it makes every syscall, and it hands the C nothing but a pointer and a length.
//!
//! ```text
//!   kernel  <--- svc/ecall --->  c_shim (Rust)  <--- C ABI: (u8*, usize) --->  c_seam.c
//!                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^
//!                                every capability and every syscall stops here
//! ```
//!
//! So the foreign component cannot widen the kernel's syscall surface (rule 3 / DECISIONS §4): not
//! because we asked it not to, but because a syscall needs a capability slot and it has never seen
//! one. And the confinement claim is exactly as narrow as it should be: **the C can corrupt memory
//! inside a grant this shell already had, and nothing else.**
//!
//! # What this shell is endowed with
//!
//! | slot | capability | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | report endpoint, WRITE | so the run is legible from the outside |
//! | 1 | this instance's untyped region, WRITE | pays for `malloc`; a `DESTROY` of it is the reap |
//! | 15 | the supervision endpoint | consumed by the kernel at `START` (§26) |
//!
//! plus two mappings the confiner made: the grant at [`c_seam::GRANT_VA`], read/write, and the
//! read-only witness page immediately after it. The C is told about the first and not the second.
//!
//! # Where `malloc` comes from
//!
//! Milestone 27's untyped-backed [`MemoryRegionHeap`], wired to slot 1: the
//! region this instance was built in. So the C heap is the process's own budget, a C leak exhausts
//! this instance and touches no other process's memory, and the single `MemoryRegion::DESTROY` that reaps
//! the corpse reclaims the heap along with everything else.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-08-01 (calef, milestone 61), replacing `cshim`. The `c_` prefix means
//! "written in C" (DECISIONS §31), spelled with the separator the tenet requires; the run-together
//! form was the same defect `cseam` had.

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
#![allow(missing_docs)]
#![no_main]

// A source file shared by several binaries through `#[path]`, and each uses a different slice of it,
// so the unused halves are expected. This is the one shape where a blanket allow is the honest one:
// the module is compiled once per binary and no single binary is meant to use all of it (§38).

// The libc, in full: TWO symbols.
//
// Tier two of the three tiers in design/roadmap/36-foreign-component.md (freestanding / a handful of
// symbols / full POSIX).
// The C references five symbols; this file defines two of them. Both halves of that sentence were
// discovered by letting the build fail and reading the error, which is the only honest way to learn
// what a foreign object file actually demands.
//
// **What the object demands.** `llvm-nm --undefined-only` on the compiled `c_seam.o`, identically
// on both ISAs and at every optimization level: `malloc`, `free`, `memcpy`, `memset`, `strlen`.
// Nothing else. No compiler-rt helper, no `memmove` conjured out of a struct copy, and no
// `__stack_chk_fail` (this component has no stack arrays, but `-fno-stack-protector` in build.rs
// makes that a decision rather than luck).
//
// **What the linker demands, which is less.** Delete all five and `rust-lld` reports exactly two
// undefined symbols: `malloc` and `free`. `memcpy`, `memset`, and `strlen` are already there, weakly,
// from Rust's own `compiler_builtins` (that is what makes a `no_std` Rust binary link at all). The C
// component's needs and the Rust runtime's overlap almost exactly, which is a real and reusable
// finding: the "handful of symbols" tier is smaller than it looks.
//
// **And why we do not define them anyway, which cost a debugging session.** The obvious Rust `memcpy`
// shim is `core::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping`, and `copy_nonoverlapping` *lowers to a call to `memcpy`*.
// So the shim calls itself, forever, and the symptom is not a stack overflow at a plausible depth but
// a store fault exactly at `sp` sixteen bytes below whatever stack you gave the process. (Found here
// with a 16 KiB stack, reproduced with 64 KiB, then understood.) `compiler_builtins` avoids the trap
// by compiling with `#[no_builtins]`; a program crate cannot. So the right answer is the one that is
// also the smaller one: let the runtime keep the three symbols it already owns, and shim only the two
// it does not. Recorded in notes/c-seam.md, because the next person to shim a libc symbol in Rust
// will reach for `copy_nonoverlapping` too.
