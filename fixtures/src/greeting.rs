//! **A program no boot image carries** (milestone 198 (a package manager) rung 3a).
//!
//! It prints one line and exits. What makes it worth a file is where it comes from: `fixtures`
//! lists it in `packaged_only`, so no archive packs it (`script/swish-check` reads the archive to
//! make sure), and the only way onto a machine is the
//! package `packages/greeting.recipe` builds. So when it runs at the prompt, the image's catalogue,
//! the fetch, the digest check and the activation set are the only things that could have put it
//! there. Every earlier install line ran a copy of the image's own `uptime`, which proved the path
//! and not novelty.
//!
//! ```text
//! $ package install greeting
//!   fetched and installed; generation 2 is live
//! $ packages/greeting/0.1.0/greeting
//! hello from a package this image never carried
//! ```
//!
//! # What this program holds
//!
//! Slot 0, its output: the sink contract (`crates/byte_sink_protocol`). Slot 1, the clock page,
//! because its manifest asks for one, and that is the second line it prints.
//!
//! **The manifest travels in its own bytes** (milestone 597, provisional; DECISIONS §197 option M2):
//! [`MANIFEST`], carried as an ELF note. No boot image has a row for this program, so the note is
//! the only place the progenitor can learn it wants a clock, and a vouched copy holding slot 1 is
//! the proof the note was read. Before notes, every installed program was endowed as `uptime` is,
//! and this line said `clock: not held`.
//!
//! ```text
//! $ packages/greeting/0.1.0/greeting
//! hello from a package this image never carried
//! clock: held at slot 1, as its manifest note asked
//! ```
//!
//! # BUGS
//!
//! It proves the path and a manifest's travel, and nothing about the program: a line of text is
//! the least a program can do, and it does not read the clock it holds.
//!
//! Name: provisional (2026-09-26). Says what it prints; GNU `hello`, which exists to demonstrate
//! packaging, would be the prior art, and `hello` is already a fixture here.
