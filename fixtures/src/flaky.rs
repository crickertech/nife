//! **The supervised sub-server that dies once** (milestone 22 phase B.2).
//!
//! The thing the tree exists to keep alive. It is handed exactly one capability, a WRITE view of a
//! report endpoint, and one scalar: which attempt it is. Attempt 0 crashes on purpose; any later
//! attempt does its work and exits cleanly.
//!
//! That shape is deliberate, because it exercises **both** halves of the fault endpoint (DECISIONS
//! §26) against a real supervisor: a crash that must be restarted, and a clean exit that must not be.
//! A program that only crashed would prove the restart but not the policy.
//!
//! Name: provisional, and ruled: calef ruled **`first_attempt_crasher`** on 2026-09-13, working
//! the unratified worklist. The block stays `provisional` because the ratified name is not this
//! file's yet: the rename waits for milestone 175 to move this file, and until it lands `flaky`
//! belongs on the worklist rather than off it. Introduced 2026-07-29 as a
//! supervision fixture: attempt 0 crashes on purpose and any later attempt exits cleanly, which
//! exercises both halves of the fault endpoint (DECISIONS §26) against a real supervisor.
//!
//! The reason the old name failed is the reason a blind sweep would be dangerous, and they are
//! the same reason. "Flaky" is the field's established word for a test that fails
//! intermittently, and this program does not fail intermittently: it fails deterministically,
//! once, by attempt number. So the name borrowed recognition it then contradicted, and a reader
//! who knew the word arrived with the wrong model. That borrowing also means the word appears
//! across this tree in its ordinary sense, in prose that must not move: `script/lint`,
//! `.github/workflows/verify.yml`, `design/fatal-risks.md`, and a quotation in
//! `notes/proof-retrospective.md` that is protected twice over. Enumerate before sweeping.
//!
//! Refused `dies_once`, which this header used to propose and which is the clearest description
//! in the file, because it is a verb phrase where the noun rule wants a thing. Refused `crasher`
//! as generic and wrong by half, since the later attempts do not crash and that is the half
//! proving a clean exit must *not* be restarted. Refused `restart_fixture`: once 175 lands this
//! file is in `fixtures/`, so the directory already says fixture. `first_attempt_crasher` is an
//! agent noun in the qualifier-plus-agent-noun shape ratified the same day for
//! `interrupt_heeder` and `interrupt_ignorer`, and it states the determinism the old name denied.
