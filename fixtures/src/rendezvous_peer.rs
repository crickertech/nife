//! **The peer on the other end of a minted rendezvous**, milestone 19a.
//!
//! Holds the channel (slot 0) and a report endpoint (slot 1). It receives a capability to a
//! rendezvous some other process minted out of its own memory, listens on it, and reports what
//! arrives.
//!
//! **It never saw a memory region and never asked the kernel to create anything.** Its authority to
//! listen arrived entirely by delegation, which is the half of milestone 19a that the minter
//! cannot demonstrate on its own.
//!
//! The other half is `rendezvous_minter`.
//!
//! Name: provisional (milestone 291). This was `hello`'s `EP_USER` role, number 18. `user` was
//! doubly wrong: it is a generic word, and in this tree it already means "a person with an
//! identity" (`login`, `credentialer`) and "the unprivileged half of the machine" (`kernel/src/user`).

#![no_std]
// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
