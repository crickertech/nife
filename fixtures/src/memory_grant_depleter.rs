//! `memory_grant_depleter`: a program that spends exactly the memory it was granted, and reports
//! how much.
//!
//! Milestone 31 phase 1. This is what makes `memory_grant_depleter --mem N` *real* rather than
//! parsed-and-ignored. The shell splits `N` pages off its own untyped budget and delegates that
//! untyped to this program (init inserts it at slot 1); the program then maps pages out of it, one
//! at a time, until the budget is exhausted, and reports the count on its result endpoint (slot 0).
//!
//! The number it reports *is* the authority the command line handed it. Grant more, it maps more;
//! grant nothing, and it holds no untyped at slot 1 at all, so its very first `MAP` returns
//! `NoSuchSlot` and it reports zero. There is no ambient pool to fall back on: a nife process
//! spends the budget it was given and not one page more.
//!
//! One honest detail, recorded rather than hidden: an `N`-page untyped does not yield `N` mapped
//! data pages. Reaching a fresh virtual address needs page-table pages, and those come from the
//! same untyped (the kernel allocates nothing on a process's behalf, DECISIONS §10). So the
//! reported count is `N` minus the handful of pages the tables cost. That the count tracks `N`, and
//! collapses to zero with no grant, is the proof the budget is real.
//!
//! # What this program holds
//!
//! - slot 0: the result endpoint (SEND: report the page count).
//! - slot 1: an untyped budget (the delegated `--mem` grant). Absent when `--mem` was 0.
//!
//! Name: ratified 2026-09-13 (calef, a naming-ratification session), replacing a provisional name
//! that had stood since 2026-07-28. Refused `budgeter` (the incumbent: it reads as a program that
//! *manages* a budget, where this one exists to exhaust one, and the bare stem names neither which
//! budget nor that depletion is the point), `budget_spender` and `grant_spender` (both name the
//! object, but spending is what any program does with a grant; depletion is the specific claim,
//! that this one runs the grant to zero on purpose as the proof the budget is enforced rather than
//! advisory), `memory_grant_depleater` (calef's own spelling in the ratifying session, corrected
//! in it: "depleater" is not a word, and the agent noun from "deplete" is `depleter`).
//! The correction is recorded rather than quietly applied because the transcript survives the
//! session: a reader who later meets his `depleater` should be able to see why the tree spells it
//! otherwise, which is what AGENTS.md means by correcting yourself loudly.
//! **What the rename costs, stated because a reader should meet it.** Milestone 63 cites `budgeter`
//! as a member of the agent-noun family it settles (`broker`, `spawner`, `painter`, `budgeter`,
//! `compositor`, `credentialer`), using this stem as evidence the family exists. The block is BUILT
//! and keeps the word it was written with; `memory_grant_depleter` is still an agent noun, so the
//! family survives, but this member leaves that list and 63 carries a line saying so.

// Program entry points, not the crates/ library surface milestone 68's ratchet tracks
// (DECISIONS §107): each `[[bin]]` is its own crate root with one `_start`, and 58 of them
// documenting an OS-facing ABI entry point is not what the lint is for.
