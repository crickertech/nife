//! **A thread reading its own CPU from user mode**, with no syscall at all.
//!
//! calef ruled on 2026-09-21 that a thread observing *itself* reads a page rather than making a
//! crossing, because the consumer is a memory allocator asking on every allocation. (That ruling's
//! `design/decisions/` section is on another branch and is named here rather than cited.) This
//! program is the shortest thing that proves the whole chain works from the side that matters:
//! `crates/current_cpu_protocol` lays the page out, the kernel maps it read-only and writes it at
//! every switch-in, and `user_mode_runtime::current_cpu` reads it with an ordinary load.
//!
//! Reads twice across a `yield_now`, `cycle_counter_reader`'s shape and for the same reason: the
//! first read proves a thread learns its core before its first instruction, and the second proves
//! the context switch keeps writing rather than writing once at load time. A yield is not a
//! guarantee that a switch happened, so the second read is evidence and the kernel-side test's
//! direct read of a space's page is the proof.
//!
//! Reports both, plus [`current_cpu_protocol::CPU_ID_BOUND`], which is the one number in this
//! contract that two binaries have to agree on: the kernel's `cpu::MAX_CPUS` **is** that constant,
//! and a message carrying it back across the boundary is what would catch them drifting.
//!
//! **A CPU this program could not learn is reported as `u64::MAX`**, the protocol's own
//! `UNSCHEDULED`, rather than as any small number: zero is a real core and a wrong number is worse
//! than no number.
//!
//! # Bugs
//!
//! **Nothing here asserts the two reads agree or differ**, and neither would be right. A thread
//! that stayed on one core reports the same id twice and a thread the scheduler moved reports two,
//! and both are correct behaviour. The kernel-side test asserts what is actually invariant: that
//! each id names a core that is online.
//!
//! Name: provisional (this lane, 2026-09-21). Formed on `cycle_counter_reader`, the fixture it is
//! shaped after: the thing read, then `_reader`. calef names the programs.
