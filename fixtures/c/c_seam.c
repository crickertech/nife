/*
 * c_seam.c -- the foreign component (milestone 36, DECISIONS §31).
 *
 * Memory-unsafe C, compiled by bare-metal clang, linked into a Rust user_rt shell
 * (fixtures/src/c_shim.rs) and confined by the kernel like any other process. It is the
 * smallest thing that can prove the seam: one honest function that does real work
 * over a granted buffer, and two functions that misbehave on purpose.
 *
 * THE RULES THIS FILE LIVES UNDER, and they are enforced by what is absent here:
 *
 *   - It makes NO syscalls. There is no `svc`, no `ecall`, no inline asm, and no
 *     declaration of anything that would trap. Everything it can do to the outside
 *     world it does through the pointer it was handed.
 *   - It holds NO capabilities. A capability is a slot number in a cspace, and this
 *     file never sees one. It could not name one if it wanted to.
 *   - It gets plain buffers. `unsigned char *` and a length, nothing else.
 *
 * That is what makes the confinement claim tight: the worst this file can do is
 * corrupt memory inside a grant the Rust shell already had, and it cannot widen the
 * kernel's syscall surface by so much as one method, because it cannot reach it.
 *
 * The five libc symbols below are this component's whole libc. Two of them are defined
 * in Rust in c_shim.rs, and the other three the Rust bare-metal runtime already supplies;
 * there is no libc on this target, and nothing behind these needs POSIX semantics. See
 * notes/c-seam.md for how that list was discovered (by letting the build fail and reading
 * the error, not by guessing) and for why shimming `memcpy` in Rust is a trap.

 * component would do when the input must survive), `memcpy` moves it, `memset` clears
 * the output area before writing it, `free` returns the scratch. The heap those two
 * come from is the process's own untyped budget (milestone 27), so a leak in this file
