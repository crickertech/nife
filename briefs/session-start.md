**Provisional name.** What a maintainer session does before it briefs anything. You have just opened
a session, on patagonia or in a cloud container, and you do not yet know what happened while nobody
was here. Do the work; do not ask questions.

**Where this came from.** The two clauses below lived in `AGENTS.md` (the `launchd` watchers, and
reading the queue for what the watchers already found), moved here on 2026-09-23 by the extraction
that milestone 579 (which of the constitution must be carried, and which is a brief) proposed. The
trigger is a specific, recurring, nameable moment, the start of a session, which is the test that
moved them.

**Why it is a checklist rather than a habit.** Both of these are duties that belong to whoever
happens to notice, and that is precisely the arrangement this project has already watched fail. On
2026-08-04 three such duties went unperformed in one evening: two green pull requests sat unmerged
for hours, `main` went red with nobody assigned, and merging one pull request staled eight others
that nothing picked back up.

## 1. Are the watchers alive

**Two of the three moved into GitHub Actions on 2026-09-24** and run as `nife-smelter[bot]`, so what
you are checking is a run list rather than a laptop:

    gh workflow list --repo crickertech/nife | grep -Ei "merge drain|trunk health"
    gh run list --repo crickertech/nife --workflow "merge drain" --limit 3
    gh run list --repo crickertech/nife --workflow "trunk health" --limit 3

Both must read `active` in the first command, and both must show a run within the last fifteen
minutes in the others. A `disabled_inactivity` or `disabled_manually` workflow is a stopped watcher;
re-enable it with `gh workflow enable`. GitHub also drops scheduled runs under load, so one missing
tick is not a fault and an hour of them is.

**A failed `trunk health` run is the finding, not a fault in the watcher.** That job exits non-zero
when `main` is red or a cadence is dead, deliberately, because a printed line inside a green run is
a line nobody reads. Open it and act on it.

The third watcher is per developer and stays on your own machine, because it reads your own lane
worktrees and nothing else can:

    launchctl list | grep nife

One entry must be present, `com.nife.at-risk`. If it is missing, `notes/merge-queue.md` has the
plist; until it is loaded, `helpers/at-risk-check.sh` is one pass you can run by hand from the main
checkout. Nothing else should be in that list: `com.nife.merge-drain` and `com.nife.trunk-health`
are retired, and a laptop still running either is a second drain arming the same pull requests the
workflow is arming. The retirement commands are in `notes/merge-queue.md`.

**In a cloud session there is no `launchctl` and no lane worktree to watch, so skip this check and
go to step 2.** The risk it covers moves to you: an ephemeral container that ends with uncommitted
work loses it, and nothing watches for that, so commit and push before every pause.

`notes/merge-queue.md` has the workflows, the plist, the tested premise they rest on, the cadence
costs calef accepted, and a `BUGS` section honest that nothing reports a watcher's death.

## 2. Read what they already found

**A running watcher is not the same as a watcher that has been read, and this is the half that gets
skipped.** `merge-drain.sh` posts once per stall and then goes quiet by design, so a stalled pull
request does not re-announce itself every five minutes. Nothing re-announces it to a session that
opens later either. A watcher that reported at 03:00 and a session that opens at 09:00 never meet
unless somebody goes looking.

So go looking, and do it by running the brief that already exists:

    briefs/survey-the-queue.md

That brief is the queue read, in full: it fetches, lists `mergeStateStatus` and `statusCheckRollup`,
distinguishes a `DIRTY`/`CONFLICTING` pull request that needs a rebase from a `BLOCKED` one whose
checks are merely still running, treats a `needs-architect` hold as a deliberate hold rather than a
failure, and names the traps (`auto=false` does not mean unqueued; an absent pull request may have
merged rather than vanished). **Do not restate its commands here or type them from memory.** This
step is one line on purpose: a second copy of those instructions is a second thing to keep correct,
and the copy that drifts is always the one nobody is looking at.

## 3. Treat what it reports as tasks, not as a status line

This is the whole reason step 2 exists, and it is the failure the steward role was meant to cover
and did not, for a reason worth keeping: **it reported and never acted.** A stalled queue announced
in a message is only useful if somebody reads the message and then does something.

Every `DIRTY` or `CONFLICTING` pull request and every `FAILURE` conclusion the survey names is a task
to resolve, ranked the same as keeping lanes full, not a line to skim past. A conflict needs judgment
a watcher does not have: **a queue reports, it does not resolve.**

Two of them already have briefs of their own:

- a rebase needed: `briefs/rebase-onto-main.md`
- a failing check to diagnose: `briefs/triage-a-failing-check.md`

## EXAMPLES

The two that run in Actions, healthy:

    $ gh run list --repo crickertech/nife --workflow "merge drain" --limit 3
    completed	success	merge drain	schedule	main	...	2m
    completed	success	merge drain	schedule	main	...	7m
    completed	success	merge drain	schedule	main	...	12m

Five minutes apart is the cadence. Read the gaps, not only the conclusions: three green runs an hour
old is a stopped watcher wearing a green badge.

The one that stays on your machine, alive (real output shape, patagonia):

    $ launchctl list | grep nife
    -	0	com.nife.at-risk

The first column is the process id, `-` meaning the job is loaded but not currently running, which is
correct for an interval job between ticks. The second column is the last exit status: **`0` is what
you want, and a non-zero number there is a watcher that ran and failed**, which looks identical to a
healthy one if you only check that the line exists.

A session that finds the retirement half-done:

    $ launchctl list | grep nife
    -	0	com.nife.at-risk
    -	0	com.nife.merge-drain

That second line is two drains arming the same pull requests, the laptop's as `calef` and the
workflow's as `nife-smelter[bot]`. Retire it with the commands in `notes/merge-queue.md`; do not
leave it because it looks harmless.

## Stop, do not improvise

- **A watcher whose `launchctl` exit status is non-zero, or an Actions run that failed for a reason
  that is not a red trunk.** Report it with the number or the run link. Do not reload the job or
  re-run the workflow repeatedly hoping it takes; something is failing and that status is the only
  evidence you have of what.
- **Anything the survey reports that is not a rebase, a failing check, or a `needs-architect` hold.**
  Say what you saw and stop.

## BUGS

- **No watcher reports its own death**, which is the gap calef accepted rather than solved. Moving
  two of them into Actions made the evidence public rather than removing the gap: a disabled workflow
  is visible to anyone who looks, and looking is still step 1 of a checklist a session has to
  remember. A watcher can be down for as long as nobody opens a session.
- **A green run list and a loaded job both show the mechanism, not the work.** A run that read the
  wrong repository, or a `launchd` job exiting 0 against a checkout nobody uses, looks exactly like
  a healthy one here.
- **Scheduled runs are delayed under load and dropped at peak.** So "no run in the last five
  minutes" is not evidence of anything on its own, which makes this check softer than the one it
  replaced: you are reading a trend rather than a fact.
- **Nothing measures whether a session actually runs this.** There is no gate, no log, and no record
  that a session started; the honest position is that this is rung three of the constitution's
  ladder, a written record for whoever opens it.
- **Steps 2 and 3 are the same instruction split across two files**, deliberately, and that split
  costs something: a reader who opens only this brief learns that the queue must be read, and has to
  open `briefs/survey-the-queue.md` to learn how. The alternative was a third copy of the queue-read
  instructions, which is the failure mode this extraction was written to remove.
