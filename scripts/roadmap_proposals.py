"""Reading an unnumbered roadmap proposal, for the `script/` entry points that count them.

**What a proposal is** (milestone 247, calef 2026-09-03). Anybody may add to the roadmap;
prioritising it is a different act. A lane that finds work it is not doing writes
`design/roadmap/proposals/<slug>.md` with no number in it, because the thing concurrent lanes
collide over is the NUMBER and not the authority. The integrator promotes one at merge: give it a
number, `git mv` it up a directory, add the index row.

**Why this file exists.** `script/roadmap` gates the pile and lists it; `script/metrics` counts it
per week (milestone 276). Milestone 236's rule is that a derivation two scripts each carry a copy of
will drift while both keep looking authoritative, and the pile's whole defence against becoming a
graveyard is that a script can see it, so a second definition that quietly disagreed about what
counts is the one failure this record cannot afford.

**What is deliberately not here**, the same line `scripts/rust_source.py` and
`scripts/name_provenance.py` draw: only the derivation over a filename and a file's text. The
directory LISTING stays at the caller, because `script/roadmap` reads the working tree and
`script/metrics` reads blobs at revisions nobody has checked out.

Name: provisional, minted by milestone 276's lane on 2026-09-11, and it is a shared python module
under `scripts/`, which `script/names` puts out of its own scope, so this paragraph is the record
rather than a `Name:` block. `proposals` alone would not say which proposals (this tree also has
`**Status: PROPOSED**` decisions in `design/decisions/`, a different record with a different form);
`roadmap_records` would promise the index rows too, which live in two different parses that this
does not touch. calef names modules, and has not ratified it.

# ---- promotion, which removes the proposal ------------------------------------
#
# **A promoted proposal is deleted, and the milestone is where its work lives.** calef ruled this
# twice in one day and the second ruling is the one that stands: on the morning of 2026-09-18 he
# allowed a promoted proposal to be retired in place, carrying a `**Promoted:**` line; that evening,
# looking at what the first cluster promotion actually did to the directory, he reversed it. *"I'd
# like to drain the proposal files as we promote them versus accumulate another place where we
# capture work."*
#
# **The reversal is right and the evidence that argued against it was weaker than it looked.** The
# case for keeping was milestone 304's proposal, said to carry three things it got wrong that its
# block did not. Its block carries all three, in more detail: the prerequisite that was already
# done, the four `E0133`s, and Kani's bundled rustc running ten months behind this tree's pin. The
# same was true of milestone 313's. So keeping the files preserved almost nothing and cost a
# directory that grows for ever, which is a second place work accumulates and the exact shape
# `notes/roadmap.md` calls a burial in a new location.
#
# So the count this module feeds is the count of files, and a promoted proposal stops being either.
# What a promotion owes instead is that **anything the proposal carried and the milestone does not
# gets folded in before the file goes**, which is draining rather than discarding.
#
# **What this cannot do**, and the second half is the larger one.
#
# Nothing can find a promotion nobody wrote down. `promoted_from` reads a numbered block's own
# claim, and a spelling it does not know is a silent miss.
#
# **And a proposal closed without ever being promoted is invisible here**, which is the half of
# calef's rule no gate reaches. The ordering IS gated for a proposal a numbered block names in a
# `**Proposed.**` follow-on bullet, because that disposition must resolve to a file that exists, so
# deleting one fails the build. The rest are standalone, and deleting one leaves NOTHING in the
# working tree to notice: this module reads the tree, not the history. A gate that read `git log`
# could see it and is deliberately not written here, because `script/metrics` reads blobs at
# revisions nobody has checked out and the two callers would then need different answers to the same
# question.
