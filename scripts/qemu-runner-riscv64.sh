# The RISC-V QEMU runner (milestone 20). Cargo invokes this for `cargo run` and `cargo test` on the
# riscv64 target, appending the path to the ELF it just built.
#
# Simpler than the aarch64 runner: QEMU's `virt` machine boots a RISC-V ELF directly with `-kernel`,
# and `-bios default` runs OpenSBI, which initializes the machine in M-mode and hands our payload
# control in S-mode (hart id in a0, device-tree pointer in a1). There is no flat-Image / objcopy
# step, because RISC-V has no equivalent of the arm64 Image header that the aarch64 path needs.
#
# The kernel halts with `wfi` (arch::halt), so QEMU does not exit on its own. Bound any interactive
# run with scripts/qemu-bounded.sh, exactly as on aarch64 (see CLAUDE.md, "Never leave QEMU
# running"). See notes/riscv-port.md.
