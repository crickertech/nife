# PROVISIONAL NAME. Minted 2026-08-04; not put to calef. See the `Name:` block below.
#
# # Why this exists
#
# Nothing owned trunk health, and the gap was in the role definitions rather than in anyone's
# execution. A developer works one milestone in one lane and cannot see `main` by design. The
# steward watches pull request checks, conflicts, at-risk work and idle lanes, and its charter never
# mentioned the trunk. The maintainer is told to keep hygiene, and that list is prune the worktree,
# delete the branch, relink `nife-dev`, leave no QEMU. So the role that merges is the role that
# breaks `main`, and the role that exists to compensate for the merger being busy was not pointed at
# the thing merging breaks.
#
# **The signal was never missing.** CI runs on every push to `main` and has all along. On 2026-08-04
# `main` went red and was found by someone running `script/lint` by hand after a merge, which is luck
# rather than process. This reads the signal that already exists.
#
# # What it says, and what it deliberately does not
#
# It reports the transition to red, naming the failing workflows, and the transition back to green.
# It does **not** report every red poll, because a trunk that stays broken for an hour is one fact
# and not twenty-four.
#
# It says "nobody is assigned to this" on purpose. A red trunk with an owner is a task; a red trunk
# without one is the failure this script exists to surface, and the wording is the difference.
#
# **Recovery is reported too, deliberately.** A watcher that only speaks on failure trains its reader
# to treat silence as health, and silence is also what a dead watcher produces.
#
# # The thing that would prevent this rather than detect it
#
# GitHub's require-branches-to-be-up-to-date rule, applied 2026-08-04 (§73). Two pull requests, each
# green against the base it was cut from, merged in an order neither had ever been tested in and put
# `main` red. That rule forces a re-run against the new `main`, turning that failure into one re-run
# instead of a broken trunk. This script is the detection half; the rule is the prevention half.
#
# Name: unrecorded. Provisional, minted 2026-08-04 and not yet put to calef. `trunk` rather than
# `main` because the branch could be renamed and the concept could not, and because "trunk health"
# is the term the field already uses. See notes/merge-queue.md.

# A watcher must run from the MAIN checkout, never from a lane worktree, and this refuses rather
# than trusting anyone to remember. Measured cause, twice: `/bin/sh` reads a script LAZILY, so
# deleting the file under a running shell can kill it mid-loop. The merge drain died that way on
# 2026-08-18 when the worktree it was launched from was pruned, and `trunk-health.sh` died the same
# way later the same day during a 24-worktree cleanup, silently, while `main` was red on the
# fastpath gate for hours. The drain survived that second sweep only because it happened to have
# been relaunched with an absolute path into the main checkout.
#
# Only the watching form is refused. `--once` is a check anybody may run anywhere, including a lane
# gating its own work, and it exits long before a prune could reach it.
#
# `--git-dir` resolves to `.git/worktrees/<name>` in a linked worktree and to `.git` in the main
# checkout, which is the cheapest true test available; `--git-common-dir` points at the shared
# `.git` from both and cannot tell them apart.

# **A scheduled workflow's red is invisible to `state()` above, structurally rather than by
# oversight**, and that is why this second question is asked here (milestone 238). `state()` filters
# runs to `headSha == main`'s current tip, which is the right filter for "is the trunk broken" and
# the wrong one for a cadence: a weekly job's run matches the tip only until the next merge, and at
# this tree's merge rate that window is minutes. So `mutation testing` failed four Mondays running
# and this watcher, pointed straight at the same API, could not have seen any of them.
#
# `script/cadence-check` is where the judgment lives; this only decides when to speak. Same
# transition discipline as RED/GREEN, for the same reason: a cadence that has been dead for a month
# is one fact, not four hundred polls of it. `|| true` because a dead cadence is its exit 1 and this
# script runs under `set -e`.
