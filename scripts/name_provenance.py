"""Reading a `Name:` provenance block, for the `script/` entry points that count them.

**Why this file exists.** Milestone 115 put a name's provenance in the header of the thing it names
(`//! Name: ratified 2026-08-04 (calef, milestone 63). Refused `x` (why).`), and `script/names`
derives the table from it. Milestone 276 put the same four-word vocabulary on the metrics dashboard
as a weekly series, which is a second reader of the same blocks. The derivation is shared rather
than copied for milestone 236's reason: a gate and a dashboard that each carry their own copy of a
definition will drift, both will look authoritative, and nothing will fire. `scripts/rust_source.py`
is the same move for the `unsafe` census and the harness count, and its docstring is the longer
argument.

**What is deliberately NOT here, and it is the same line `rust_source.py` draws.** Only the
derivation over text is shared; the file *sourcing* stays in each caller. `script/names` walks the
working tree with `os.listdir` and `os.walk`, because a gate is asked about the tree in front of it.
`script/metrics` enumerates the same four kinds out of a `git ls-tree` at a historical revision and
never checks anything out, because a report is asked about the past and AGENTS.md forbids the
checkout that would be needed. The two enumerations cannot be one function; the two parses can, and
are.

**Form only.** Nothing here can tell whether a reason is true, whether a date is right, or whether a
`recorded` citation leads anywhere. That is `script/names`' own recorded limit and it is not
closeable by a script: a reason is prose, and prose is checked by reading.

Name: provisional, minted by milestone 276's lane on 2026-09-11. It is a shared python module under
`scripts/`, which `script/names` puts out of its own scope, so it carries no `Name:` block of its
own and this paragraph is the record instead. `provenance` alone was considered and reads as the
mechanism rather than the subject, which is the same objection `script/names`' own header records
against `provenance` as a command name; `naming` names the whole topic, including the conventions in
design/naming.md that this file knows nothing about. calef names modules, and has not ratified it.

# `provisional`, which is a legitimate answer nothing disputes. Neither defect was visible alone.
# `strays` closes it by asking the other question: what in this file LOOKS like a header and is not
# the one that was read.

# A surface's block prefix says which language's comments to read, not which marker the block must

    A continuation is the next comment line at the same prefix, **across paragraph breaks**: an empty

    **It used to stop at the first empty comment line, and that hid refusals** (DECISIONS §155's
    sibling finding, 2026-09-18). A block written as one paragraph per argument, which is how the
    tree's best ones are written, put every refusal after the first break and therefore out of
    reach: `crates/screen_console` recorded four and `script/names --refused` could see none of
    them. That defeats the one query milestone 115 exists to serve, *has this name been refused
    before*, whose worked example is milestone 63 having already refused `system_builder` for a
    reason nobody could find.

    **The widening was measured before it was made**, because this parse is shared with
    `script/metrics` and a change here moves a dashboard as well as a gate. Across all 165 surfaces
    carrying a block, the wider read changes **no** status, date or well-formedness verdict, and
    makes **91** more refusals visible in `.rs` surfaces alone.

    The cost is that a block now runs to the end of its comment run, so prose after it is read as
    part of it. Four files put a heading after their block and were moved to the tree's own
    convention (139 of 143 already had the block last); `script/lint` fails a `Refused` written
    outside what this reads, which is the remaining shape.

    Returns None when the file carries no `Name:` line at all, which every caller reports as a
