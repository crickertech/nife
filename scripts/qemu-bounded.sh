#     scripts/qemu-bounded.sh 10 qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt ...
#
# # Why this exists
#
# The obvious trick, `perl -e 'alarm N; exec @ARGV' <cmd>`, **does not work on QEMU.**
# QEMU installs its own SIGALRM handler (it uses timers internally), so the alarm is
# swallowed and the process runs forever.
#
# We found this out the hard way: eleven abandoned QEMU processes accumulated over a day
# of development, burning a combined 729% CPU, the oldest with almost eight hours of CPU
# time on it. Every "bounded" run had leaked.
#
# QEMU *does* honour SIGTERM, so that's what we use: start the child, start a killer in
# the background, and make sure the killer dies with us.
#
# Note the `<&0` on the child: a backgrounded command's stdin is otherwise redirected to
# /dev/null by the shell (POSIX), which silently breaks piping input to QEMU's serial port.
# We found that the hard way trying to drive the milestone-10 shell from a pipe.
#
# # The bound is not the only way this script's job ends (milestone 226)
#
# The original killer slept for the whole bound and then fired. That bounds a run which is
# *allowed to finish*; it does nothing about a run whose wrapper is killed. When a session
# dies, or a harness is killed with `pkill -f`, or somebody hits Ctrl-C, the wrapper goes
# and **QEMU is inherited by pid 1 and runs forever**. It then holds the write lock on a
# disk image, and the *next* run fails with QEMU's `Failed to get "write" lock`, which names
# a file and nothing about the process holding it. Milestone 127's EL2 lane lost time to
# that twice in one session before recognising the shape.
#
# So the killer now has two reasons to fire, and they are the two ways this run can be over:
#
# 1. **The bound expired.** The original job, unchanged in effect.
# 2. **The wrapper is gone.** The killer polls `kill -0` on the wrapper's pid once a second
#    and kills the child as soon as that fails. This is what covers a SIGKILLed wrapper, a
#    dead session, and a closed terminal, none of which run any trap anywhere.
#
# and it also fires on its own death:
#
# 3. **The killer itself was signalled** (SIGTERM or SIGHUP, which is what `pkill -f
#    qemu-bounded` and a hangup send). Its trap kills the child on the way out, so the one
#    process that knows the child's pid never takes that knowledge with it.
#
# **SIGINT is deliberately not in that trap list**, because listing it would be a lie: a
# shell puts an asynchronous subshell's SIGINT to ignore before the subshell can trap it,
# so the trap would never run. Ctrl-C is covered anyway, and better: the wrapper dies of it,
# the killer survives it, and reason 2 fires within a second.
#
# The parent traps too, which is not redundant with reason 2. It makes the ordinary Ctrl-C
# and `kill` cases immediate instead of costing up to a second, and it is the only path that
# can also stand the killer down rather than leaving it to notice.
#
# # BUGS
#
# **A SIGKILL to the killer defeats all of it, and nothing on macOS can fix that.** SIGKILL
# is not trappable, and macOS has no `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG)`, so a supervisor that is shot
# in the head cannot hand off. `kill -9` on a whole process group is the realistic way to hit
# this. That case is what the lock diagnostic below is for: it cannot prevent the orphan, but
# it makes the next run say who is holding the image instead of naming a file.
#
# **The parent-alive poll can be fooled by pid reuse.** If the wrapper dies abnormally and its
# pid is reused within the bound, the killer waits out the full bound instead of firing early,
# which is exactly the old behaviour and never worse than it. It cannot go the other way: a
# live wrapper's pid is not reused.
#
# **The poll costs a `sleep` and a `kill -0` per second**, so a very long bound spends a few
# hundred syscalls. That is not measurable next to an emulator.
#
# **The lock diagnostic only inspects arguments that look like disk images** (`*.img`,
# `*.qcow2`, `*.raw`, and any `file=` field of a comma-separated option), and only reports
# holders that have the file open for **writing**. A lock held on something named differently is
# not reported, and neither is a reader, which is deliberate: the message is about a write lock,
# and reporting readers made it fire on every green `script/test` that overlapped another lane,
# because the three legs share one read-only OVMF firmware file.
