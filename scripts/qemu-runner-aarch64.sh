#
# Why this exists rather than a plain `qemu-system-aarch64 ... -kernel` line in
# .cargo/config.toml: QEMU only follows the **Linux arm64 boot protocol** (and
# therefore only hands us a device tree pointer in x0) for a flat `Image`. Given an
# ELF, it takes a bare-metal path instead and populates no registers at all.
#
# So we strip the ELF down to a flat binary. The arm64 Image header lives at byte 0
# of it (kernel/src/arch/aarch64/image_header.s), which is what makes QEMU recognize
# the blob as a kernel.
#
# Tests boot through exactly the same path as `cargo xtask run` does, deliberately.
# A test harness that exercises a different boot path than the real thing is testing
# a fiction.

# harness wants.
#
# Set NIFE_ACCEL=hvf to run under Apple's Hypervisor.framework instead: HVF puts the kernel on
# the real Apple Silicon core at guest EL1, using the hardware virtualization the chip already
# has. The coincidence that makes this a flag and not a port is that the host and the guest are the
# same ISA (aarch64). Two consequences:
#
#   - HVF runs the PHYSICAL core, so `-cpu host` is mandatory; you cannot ask for an emulated a72.
#   - gic-version is PINNED to 2, so a future QEMU default cannot swap in a GICv3 our driver does
#     not speak. QEMU emulates the GIC either way (Apple cores use their own AIC natively) and
#     injects interrupts through HVF, so the MMIO GICv2 driver keeps working.
#
# NIFE_CPU overrides the TCG model (milestone 59, the parity twin of the riscv runner's flag).
# Under HVF there is nothing to override: the guest runs on the physical Apple core, so `-cpu host`
# is the only answer and asking for anything else is a mistake worth failing on rather than
# silently ignoring.
# NIFE_EL2=1 builds the machine with an EL2 the kernel is started at, which is the closest
# rehearsal patagonia can give of a real board (milestone 127, the seL4 machine). QEMU's `virt`
# starts a kernel at EL1 by default; `virtualization=on` gives the machine a hypervisor level and
# enters the payload there, which is what U-Boot does on the Jetson TX1 with TF-A's BL31 below it.
# `boot.s` then reads `CurrentEL` and drops itself, and the whole suite runs unchanged.
#
# Two things change with it and both are the machine talking, not a workaround. `/psci` states
# `smc` rather than `hvc`, because an `hvc` from EL1 would arrive at the EL2 we just left; and
# PSCI starts every secondary at EL2 too, whichever level called `CPU_ON`, so `secondary_boot`
