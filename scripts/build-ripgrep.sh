# Build **unmodified `ripgrep` from crates.io** for the nife custom target (milestone 121).
#
# This is an experiment's apparatus, not part of the build. Nothing in `script/test` runs it and no
# gate needs it: `xtask initrd-aarch64` packs the resulting ELF only if it is already on disk, and
# `kernel/src/user/ripgrep_tests.rs` skips when it is not. That is deliberate, and DECISIONS §46 is
# the reason: making the gate fetch `ripgrep` and its ~40 transitive crates would put a crates.io
# dependency tree in this repository's build, which is calef's call and not a lane's.
#
# The whole point of milestone 121 is that the source is somebody else's and is untouched. There is
# no patch, no vendored copy, and no fork. What differs from a Linux build is entirely on the
# command line below: the target spec, `-Zbuild-std` against the patched `nife-dev` toolchain, and
# the three link arguments `std_exerciser/build.rs` supplies for a program built in-tree (the shared
# linker script, `-u_start`, and no build id).
#
# Both architectures, because DECISIONS §19 makes parity a gate rather than an aspiration: a
# capability ships on every supported target or a scope note records the gap and the plan. x86_64 is
# the recorded gap, and it is milestone 184's rather than this experiment's: milestone 27 shipped
# `std` for aarch64 and riscv64 only, so there is no `std` on x86_64 and therefore no `ripgrep`.
#
# Usage: scripts/build-ripgrep.sh [version]     (default 14.1.1)
#
# See notes/ripgrep-on-nife.md for what it does and does not do once it is running.

# The source tree is unpacked OUTSIDE this repository on purpose. `ripgrep` carries no
# `[workspace]` table, so cargo walks up and finds this repo's root manifest, then refuses to
# build a package that "believes it's in a workspace when it's not". Unpacking under `target/`
# hits that too. The alternative (a `workspace.exclude` entry) would put ripgrep in this
# repository's manifest, which is exactly the coupling this experiment is meant not to have.

# The patched std lives in the `nife-dev` toolchain, which `xtask std-src` builds and links.
# `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` rather than `+nife-dev` for the reason `xtask::std_exerciser` records: the
# cargo proxy exports `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=nightly`, which would override a `+` selector.

# `-Copt-level=s` and `-Cstrip=debuginfo` are not tuning: ripgrep's own release profile sets
# `debug = 1`, which produces a 25 MB ELF the initrd would carry into RAM. Overriding a profile from
# the command line is a build setting, not a change to the program.
# **The link base has to move, and that is a finding rather than a workaround.**
# `user/link.ld` puts every program at `0x40_0000`, and `kernel/src/user.rs` puts every program's
# stack at `0x50_0000` with a deeper std stack below that, so an image has under 896 KiB of address
# space before it collides with its own stack. ripgrep's `.text` alone is 1.37 MiB, and the loader
# refuses it with `Unmappable(AlreadyMapped)`. Relinking at 16 MiB is a link setting and touches no
# ripgrep source, but it is not something a stranger's program would know to do: see
# notes/ripgrep-on-nife.md, which argues this address map is the thing to change.
#
# Derived from `user/link.ld` by substitution rather than copied, so the two cannot drift.
