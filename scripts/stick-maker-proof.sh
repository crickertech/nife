#   cargo xtask stick                  # first: the payloads and the program
#   scripts/stick-maker-proof.sh       # then this
#
# Name: provisional. Minted 2026-09-19 by milestone/the-program-that-makes-the-stick.
#
# What it proves, in the order a stranger meets it:
#
#   1. The ERASE path. A blank 64 MiB file is attached as a disk; stick_maker finds it, erases it as
#      one FAT32 volume and writes the three boot files.
#   2. The COPY path. A second file is formatted FAT32 first (the state most sticks are sold in);
#      stick_maker finds it and copies without erasing, and a file already on it survives.
#   3. Each written image is then booted under all three UEFI firmwares as a USB stick
#      (scripts/qemu-stick.sh), and each has to reach the progenitor.
#
# **It never touches a real disk.** Every disk it names is one hdiutil just attached from a file in a
# fresh temporary directory, and before anything is written the script checks that diskutil calls it
# a `Disk Image`. stick_maker itself refuses a disk image unless `--include-disk-images` is given,
# and refuses a disk without the removable-media bit regardless, so a wrong identifier here would be
# refused twice before anything was written. macOS only: hdiutil is the file-backed disk this host has.
