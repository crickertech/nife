#
# PROVISIONAL NAME. Minted 2026-08-31 by milestone 204's lane; not put to calef. See `Name:` below.
#
# **This reports; it never deletes anything.** Every line below is a person's judgment call, even
# the ones that say "safe to delete". Nothing here runs unattended and nothing here acts.
#
# # Why this exists
#
# AGENTS.md §90: a lane's first act is a draft pull request, and the reason is that **the draft is
# the claim.** It is how two lanes cannot silently take the same milestone, the board is
# `gh pr list --draft`, it costs one command, and a draft cannot be stuck in the merge queue because
# a draft cannot be merged.
#
# **Nothing checked it.** On 2026-08-31 the lanes for milestones 121 and 194 both pushed
# `milestone/*` branches and opened nothing; the board was empty while two milestones were being
# worked, and it was noticed only because calef asked. The instruction was in both briefs, in a
# section headed *First act*, with the exact command. That is rung four behaving exactly as
# AGENTS.md says rung four behaves, and it was the second instance of the shape in this project's
# history: the first was lanes ending their turn mid-gate.
#
# A brief is prose, and prose in a brief is not a weaker mechanism than prose anywhere else. It is
# the same rung.
#
# # What it deliberately is not
#
# **Not a gate.** Nothing should fail a build over this, because the lane that most needs telling is
# one that is mid-work and about to open its pull request anyway. `script/lint` was refused for
# exactly that reason. What was missing was never enforcement; it was anything that looks.
#
# **Not a nag.** Several false-positive shapes were designed out, because a report that cries wolf
# gets ignored and then the real case goes unread:
#
#   - **The legitimate window.** A lane pushes and then opens the pull request, and GitHub refuses a
#     pull request with no commits between the branch and `main`, so a lane must produce something
#     committable first. Measured on this script's own branch: 3 minutes from branch creation to
#     draft, and that included writing the file that made the branch non-empty. `GRACE_MINUTES` is
#     five times that, and well under `merge-drain.sh`'s 75-minute stale-draft threshold, which is
#     the neighbouring report and the one this must not duplicate.
#   - **A merged lane's leftover branch.** A branch whose pull request merged and which nobody
#     deleted is hygiene, not a missing claim. It is reported on its own line, with the word
#     `LEFTOVER` and the pull request number, so nobody has to read it as an accusation. But
#     `LEFTOVER` means the branch tip itself is an ancestor of `main`, checked directly, not just
#     that some pull request from it merged: `maintainer/open-model-lanes` kept three commits after
#     its own #1089 merged, found while verifying this script against the live repository on
#     2026-09-23, and a check that trusted the pull request's state alone would have told a reader
#     to delete work the merge never included. That shape prints as `MERGED BUT DIVERGED` instead.
#   - **A branch someone opened a non-draft pull request for.** A ready pull request is a louder
#     claim than a draft, not a quieter one.
#
# # The clock, and why it is the branch's birth rather than its last commit
#
# The grace period runs from **branch creation**, taken from the repository activity feed, and a
# later push does not reset it. That is the whole point: a lane that keeps committing is precisely
# the lane whose missing claim matters, and a last-commit clock would go quiet for exactly the
# branches that are being worked hardest. `merge-drain.sh`'s `stale_drafts` uses the opposite clock
# for the opposite reason, and the pair is worth reading together.
#
# There are two clocks, not one, because a `milestone/*` claim and a stray branch answer different
# questions. `GRACE_MINUTES` (default 15) protects the gap between a push and a draft pull request,
# and stays scoped to `milestone/*` because that is the only prefix §90 (the claim is a draft pull
# request; the status flip is a gate) governs.
# `GRACE_HOURS` (default 24) covers every other branch, where the question is not "has this lane
# opened its claim yet" but "has anyone come back to this at all"; see the survey below for the
# measurement that set it.
#
# Name: unrecorded. Provisional. `lane` and `claim` are both AGENTS.md's own words for these things
# (`§90`: "the draft is the claim"), and `-check` matches `script/qemu-check` and
# `script/stack-frame-check`. It lives in `scripts/` rather than `script/` for `merge-drain.sh`'s
# reason: it is a maintainer's tool, not a front door a contributor types.
#
# # BUGS
#
#   - **It detects the absence of a claim, not a collision.** Two lanes on the same milestone with
#     two drafts is the case §90 actually fears, and this calls that fine. Detecting the real
#     collision needs the milestone number parsed out of the branch name, which is a convention
#     nothing enforces.
#   - **It cannot see a lane that has not pushed at all**, which is the more dangerous state:
#     AGENTS.md says the pushed branch is the only ledger another session can read, and uncommitted
#     work in a worktree is the one thing no part of this system protects.
#   - **Every branch except `main` and `gh-readonly-queue/*`, not just `milestone/*`.** This was
#     narrower once: "widening the pattern would also sweep in short-lived maintainer branches that
#     are not claims and are not meant to be." That reason was a guess, and a 2026-09-23 survey of
#     25 branches carrying no open pull request falsified it: 18 were `maintainer/*` or `fix/*`, and
#     every one needed action (deleted as an empty claim, deleted as superseded, or turned into a
#     pull request). The predicted class of harmless short-lived branches did not appear; the two
#     closest cases were pushed by the maintainer mid-session and were real leaks caught by this
#     widening. What was true is that a stray `maintainer/*` branch answers a different question
#     than a `milestone/*` claim, which is why it gets its own, longer clock (`GRACE_HOURS`) instead
#     of sharing `GRACE_MINUTES`: a 24-hour window against that same survey flagged 23 of 24 and
#     deferred exactly the one branch still inside its legitimate window, with zero false positives.
#   - **The activity feed is read one page deep.** A branch created more than 100 repository events
#     ago has no visible birth, and is reported rather than skipped: an old branch with no claim is
#     the case worth seeing, so the fallback errs loud instead of silent. Widening past `milestone/*`
#     makes this more likely to bite, since 100 events cover less wall-clock time on a busier day.
#   - **It reports to stdout only.** `merge-drain.sh` can comment on the pull request it is
#     complaining about; a branch with no pull request has nowhere to be told. Whoever reads the
#     drain's log reads this, and nothing reaches a lane that is not looking.
#   - **"Holds work" is sized by `git diff --shortstat`, not read.** It says how much changed, not
#     whether it matters. A person still has to look before deciding claim, land-and-delete, or
#     leave it.
